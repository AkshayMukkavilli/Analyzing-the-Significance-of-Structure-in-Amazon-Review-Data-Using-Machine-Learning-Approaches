 Eleven-year-old Liesel Meminger is a foster child who has recently arrived in a small town outside Munich, Germany during WWII. Liesel has been sent to live with Hans and Rosa Huberman, presumably for the small stipend they’ll receive. Liesel is still suffering from the loss of her little brother and the difficult and somewhat mysterious separation from her mother. She takes an immediate like to Hans, who is kind and thoughtful, but takes much longer to warm up to the abrasive Rosa.<br/><br/>Liesel makes friends with next-door neighbor Rudy and establishes herself as a self-proclaimed book thief. Becoming unlikely friends with the Mayor’s wife Ilsa affords Liesel the opportunity to read the books in the Mayor’s massive library. Along the way, Liesel is witness to the atrocities of war, heartbreaking events, love, loss and other life-changing events.<br/><br/>I saw the movie The Book Thief several years ago and loved it. When I decided it was time to read the book I was absolutely captivated. Although the book is 550 pages long, I read it in just two days – it was THAT good.<br/><br/>The book is different in several ways, ways in which I won’t go into in my review. Suffice it to say that I’m glad I saw the movie first and then read the book. I think I might have been disappointed with the movie version if it had happened in opposite order. This just goes to show how well the author has written this important piece of fictionalized history. The time period, location, mood, characters, etc. come to life as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>I was surprised at some of the other reviews, stating that the book was just plain depressing. I’m not at all sure how a book that deals with the systematic extinction of a race of people can be written about in an uplifting, happy way. Yet, the book is so much more than a story about a German girl who is living in Nazi Germany during WWII. There are many lovely, tender elements to be found in The Book Thief. The additional anniversary edition footnotes written by the author (at the end of the book) provide wonderful insight.<br/><br/>I think it’s extremely important that all generations read books like The Book Thief. This is part of history and, as poet and philosopher George Santayana said, "Those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it." This is a book that is emotionally draining, but very much worth the read!
 I waited way too long to read this book. I don't even really know why I waited so long, other than Courtney and I started this blog around the same time that I actually bought the book and it took me a while to get to the point where I started reading some of the books that I wanted to read instead of just books that we received requests for.<br/><br/>If you follow my blog at all, you know that I love WWII era historical fiction. What I loved about this book is that it showed the lives of average Germans during the war. That's not a perspective I've seen a lot (or ever that I can think of off the top of my head). But Liesel's foster family wasn't exactly average either because they held unfavorable opinions about Jewish people, at least unfavorable by German standards during the war.<br/><br/>Another highlight of this story was that it was told from the perspective of Death. It was a bit odd to get used to at first because he jumped around a bit, as Death is wont to do in the course of his work, but once I got used to it, it was a fun way to see things. While death isn't exactly omniscient, he does have access to information that a human narrator wouldn't have.<br/><br/>I realize that I'm late enough to this party that you've probably already made up your mind about whether you want to read this book or not, but if you're still on the fence about it, you should absolutely not wait any longer. You're likely to regret it if you do, like I did.<br/><br/>Overall I give The Book Thief 5.05 stars.
 With a heart full to overflowing and eyes quite moist, I finish this novel of a young waif of a girl in Hitler’s Germany whose body, soul, and spirit ought never have survived her furnace of affliction. Yet survive she does, grittily and even poetically, with the aid of a good friend, a tender father, a Jewish refugee in the basement, a mother whose harshness runs only skin keep, and a traumatized mayor’s wife who loves to have her books stolen.<br/><br/>As the old proverb—old but still true for all its rusty years—would tell us, ‘The book is far better than the movie’. This has never been more true than with Markus Zusak’s phenomenal achievement.<br/><br/>The book is narrated by Death, the Grim Reaper. Yet he is not an evil presence, indeed his tender observations are endearing. In the end, the circumstances of 1940s Europe keep him far busier than he’d prefer. Yet he cannot take his eyes off these dismal, glorious humans.<br/><br/>They haunt him, these human beings do. He sees such majesty in them, and such cruelty. The circumstances that call him into hard labors allow him to peer into the human condition at its best and, simultaneously, at its best.<br/><br/>He cannot look away from them, these horrible, beautiful, haunting beings.<br/><br/>This reader revels in the deeply biblical substratum of this compelling novel, whether intended by its author or not.<br/><br/>The best book I’ve read in a year. And I’m hardly alone, for this work has virtually nailed itself to the top rung of the New York Times Bestsellers List. As another old proverb might have it, 50,000,000 Elvis fans can’t be wrong.<br/><br/>Buy it, read it, remember it when you least expect.
 Agree with all the others giving one or two stars: who in hell thought this was a good book? the style is exasperating and there is no much meat or story. Some say that is because it was intended to young people, but I wonder how young you have to be to enjoy that kind of writing. Tried to come to terms and finish it but I could not waste more time on this.
 I suspect that nobody would give five stars to any book that referred to its only African-American character as "The N-----." Yeah, right. But this author--and a zillion reviewers, apparently--have no problem with references to The Jew, among other distancing, classically anti-Semitic/racist tactics. Personally, I was appalled. I don't know how this rather thin piece of drivel managed to pass all the PC tests, but to me, a Jewish American, I got through half of this book before the gall choked me. And nowadays, when anti-Semitism is on the rise, when streets cannot be named after a person named Lynch anymore (sorry, Jane), I'm beside myself when reading this handbook on Nazi tactics. It's a how-to, complete with countless negative epithets for Hitler's innocent victims. I do not want my grandchildren to read this garbage, even if it's written with some suave literary touches. No, I grew up with Europeans whose parents were brainwashed by Nazis. Do not encourage bad habits.
 What a strangely beautiful, wildly imaginative, and deeply moving book. The narrator is Death, who—unexpectedly—has both a sense of humor and the capacity to be moved by poignant acts of love, generosity, and courage.<br/><br/>The story itself—told from Death's unique perspective—follows 9-year-old Leisel Meminger, the Book Thief, from the day of her baby brother's death as her mother is taking them to be cared for by foster parents Hans and Rosa Hubermann at the beginning of WWII. Leisel has stolen a book that someone dropped at her brother's burial, and this begins her fascination with books and words and their myriad levels of meaning.<br/><br/>The Hubermanns are not sympathetic to Hitler. For months they hide a Jew who is trying to escape Germany and let him live in their basement. As the war progresses, the family and the town experience severe deprivation and scarcity of food, the paranoia and fear of Hitler's henchmen, and the heartaches of loved ones going off to war or becoming victims of the Allied bombing.<br/><br/>Through it all, Leisel survives physically and spiritually, and as I came to love her, I also came to love and hate the other strong characters, some of whom loved Leisel in their own way: her foster parents, her best friend Rudy Steiner, and Max, the Jew whom she befriended.<br/><br/>This story is filled with sadness and heartache, yet time and again, one character or another exhibits such resiliency and integrity that it took my breath away and filled me with admiration and hope.<br/><br/>The author uses odd formatting and a funky but effective way of handling timeframes, giving you glimpses of the future without losing the momentum or power of the narrative. This book was moving and powerful. It packed quite an emotional wallop that expanded both my mind and heart.
 This book made me feel empty in a way that only truly beautifully written books can. When I finished reading the last word on the last page of this book, I felt empty; there is a paradoxical mix of feeling incredibly saddened that the book is over but also completely satisfied because the ending was the best ending you could have ever hoped for and more. Together, those feelings left me feeling empty and breathless. It's amazing that words can be strung together on bound pages can make you feel so strongly, but that's what great books do. And this is, without a doubt, a truly great book.<br/><br/>I won't go over the plot because many reviewers have done so already, but I will tell you this: The Book Thief was one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read in my entire life. Death's point of view is hauntingly sophisticated. This is one of my favorite quotes, "A SMALL PIECE OF TRUTH: I do not carry a sickle or scythe. I only wear a hooded black robe when it's cold. And I don't have those skull-like facial features you seem to enjoy pinning on me from a distance. You want to know what I truly look like? I'll help you out. Find yourself a mirror while I continue.”<br/><br/>There are so many amazing layers to this book. I love the fact that it's a book about a book thief. I love how books are mile markers in her life, and how she herself can barely control the love and hate she feels for the power of words. I love the impact books have had on her life. The love that the characters have for Liesel is truly moving. The love that she has for them is heartbreaking in the most astounding way. This is a fictional book, but it's very much a true and honest look at humanity in its finest moments and its worst moments. It's as if Markus Zusak studied the human soul and was able to articulate its many range of feelings: love, grief, regret, relief, wonder, and everything in between.<br/><br/>This is a book that stays with you long after you are done with it. It took me ages to write this review because I wanted to do the book justice. I will end with another one of my favorite quotes from the book. “I have hated words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.”
 This is the story of Liesel Meminger who is living in Munich Germany in 1939.  Her mother took she and her brother on a train to a foster family to keep them safe during the war.  Her brother got sick and died on the journey, so Liesel is all alone when she shows up.  Her foster father is kind and generous, and her foster mother is hard and stubborn.  Each night, Liesel wakes with nightmares and her dad comes in to comfort her.  Eventually she shows him a book that she stole when they buried her brother called "The Grave Diggers Handbook".  This starts Liesels love of books and her father starts to teach her to read.<br/><br/>Over the course of her years with her foster family she steals several more books, is invited to the Mayors house to read whenever she wants, watches bombs fall on her city, and helps her parents hide a Jew.  In a time when all books were being burned by Hitler and the Nazis, Leisel was trying her best to save them.<br/><br/>I loved this book.  LOVED it.  Probably one of the best reads I have read this year.  It was well written, and had a great message.  I have read a lot of WWII books, and this was among the best.<br/><br/>Don't miss it.
 January 13, 2019<br/><br/>A Review by Anthony T. Riggio of the book The Book Thief by Markus Zusak<br/><br/>This book was recommended to me by Chris Manion, author of God's Patient Pursuit of my Soul, who advised that I would really like this story about Nazi Germany in the 1930's through the end of World War II. I ordered this book from Amazon in the Special Anniversary Hardback edition.<br/><br/>Markus Zusak in his writing created an interesting way to present the dialog of the narrator.  At the outset I thought it was the main protagonist Liesel Meminger narrating then it seemed to morph into another person, not clearly identified at first.  It made for an uncomfortable and challenging beginning only to learn after several appearances to be the spirit of Death.  This however did not create a feeling of horror or was it distracting once you got the hang of this unnamed narrator.  It did not take away from the overall story and the flow was rhythmic and consistent throughout the book,  The overall style was very interesting and provided the reader with a glimpse of what was to follow in the succeeding chapter.<br/><br/>Many reviews described the book as a something a child would enjoy or relish.  I am not sure if this is accurate as the story was very mature in its concept and gave one an inside track on the happenings of Germany during the rise and fall of the Third Reich. The human protagonist is a young girl about ten years old and how she is being abandoned by her natural mother to a family living in a suburb of Munich, Germany. She is traveling with her mother and younger brother who is quite sick.  When the train stops, some distance from the final destination in Munich, the boy dies and they have to bury him in a small cemetery where the grave diggers misplace a book; The Grave Digger's Handbook  and Liesel, purloins it for no apparent reason other than a simple souvenir of remembrance of her deceased brother.  The mother deposits Liesel with the Hans and Rosa Hubermann  family, a peasant family who lived in the poorer section of town. Rosa is a seemingly strict foster mother and her husband Hans is unemployed and on disability. Hans becomes Liesel's mentor and teaches Liesel to read via the book she stole from the cemetery.  During a book burning in Munich, where Jews were being persecuted, forbidden books were cast into public bonfires and Liesel stole her second book and added to her foster father's reading curriculum. Her friend Rudy is a Tom Sawyeresque young boy who develops a love for Liesel and several fun experiences are had by both.<br/><br/>The Hubermanns  take in an escaped Jew into their home and hide him in their basement, a very dangerous thing in Nazi Germany.  Max the Jewish fugitive becomes a second mentor to Liesel and she develops  a similar relationship as she has with Hans.<br/><br/>During one of the book burning events, Liesel steals her third book which add to her curriculum being used by Hans and now Max. She is spotted by the Mayor's wife and consequently a covert relationship is developed by the wife of the mayor and Liesel, which results in another mentor for Liesel.<br/><br/>The book has all the drama and sadness one would expect in a novel contemporaneous with Nazi Germany but it is a book worth reading. It has humor, love, sadness, drama, tragedy, suspense, unexpected and predicted outcomes.<br/><br/>I have to say I loved this book and reading it became obsessive with me and I believe it demonstrated the author's great talent.  I unhesitatingly gave this book five stars and highly recommend its reading.
 I liked this book a lot, but because the author chose to actually tell us what was going to happen, not just forecast, I found myself wishing it would end. It was hard to read and yet a good read.<br/><br/>The writing style is uniquely written from Death's omniscient point of view so of course, there was a lot of death. Well done though; not melodramatic.<br/><br/>I've read many, many books about WWII, and the holocaust. I think this is the first one I've read that touched on the plight of the German people, Nazi, and non-Nazi.<br/><br/>I appreciated that the author gave Death feelings, including a sense of humor. This line, among others, cracked me up, "For some reason, dying men always ask questions they know the answer to. Perhaps it's so they can die being right."
 Tedious.  I purchased this book based on all the great reviews.  This was written for young adults so I should have known better.  However, as a 16 year old I would have still found this book tedious.  I read half way through then put it down.  Just did not care what happened to these characters.  Death had a few humorous moments but overall gave no real imaginative spin to the storyline.
 Unbelievably disappointing.  So bad I just gave up reading it half-way through.(and I've only done this with one other book in my lifetime).  At first I thought this novel must have been originally written in another language, .....and then very poorly translated into English: but no- the author is from Australia. The frequent bold print and use of italics (very strange/distracting) made one think this work was a rudimentary screen-play.
 I did not know what to expect when I decide to read this book since it was written for young adults. I had never heard of it, but it was recommenced on the PBS 'Great American Read' special this summer. I will now say that I think everyone should read this book and I now consider it one of my all time favorites. I will be giving it to my 10 year old Great Grandson for Christmas. Last year he was interested in WWI &amp; II, so I thought it would be interesting for him to see WWII through the eyes of a girl &amp; boy his age, growing up in a small German town under the Nazi regime. I would consider it mandatory reading in middle schools, along with To Kill a Mockingbird.
 There is a lot of Holocaust literature out there, but The Book Thief really sets the bar.  It’s inventve and the perspective is a unique place to tell a whole story from.  It’s a quick read despite the length and will pull you in start to finish.  It’s one of my all-time favorite books and most definitely favorite among Holocaust Lit and YA Holocaust Lit.  The Boy in the Striped Pajamas and Number the Stars are both incredible books that tell poignant stories, so if you loved them, you’ll love this and you’ll get much more time with the characters since it’s considerably longer.  Will always recommend this book.
 The Book Thief by Markus Zusak – A Book Review<br/>  I bought this book based on a recommendation from a Christian fiction author.  I had high hopes for this book, but it far exceeded my expectations.  The story of Liesel Meminger, the book thief, is one that will linger in my memory for time upon time.  Her tragedy filled story is also filled with the appreciation of small blessings, appreciation amid great struggles.  As a retired reading specialist and classroom teacher, I was especially touched by Leisel’s struggle to learn how to read and her foster father’s patience and heroic efforts to help her.  The bond that grew between them as they worked together through The Grave Diggers’ Handbook, her first stolen book, as Leisel painstakingly painted words on the basement wall, and as Papa read to her following her many nightmares was stronger than most between biological parents and children.  Their love became bound up in a love of words, but also in a hate of words; words that healed, words that rendered.<br/>  Liesel also had intense relationships with her foster mom who loved deeply and showed it badly, with a neighborhood boy who longed for greatness and for one special kiss, with a wounded soul who shared her library and received a mended soul in return, and with one lonely Jew who also knew the power of words.  Relationships documented by an unusual narrator, Death, a connoisseur of flavors, flavors the color of the sky as souls are collected, Death who vacations in moments of distraction.<br/>  My brain loves to look for patterns, to put things in categories.  The Book Thief fits into a very small category of books, books whose language pulls me back to reread over and over just to enjoy the beauty of the words, words carefully selected and creatively used, words that are used unexpectedly, and words that paint vivid mental images, engaging all of my senses, pulling at my heart strings.  If joins The Secret Life of Bees and The Memory Keeper’s Daughter among a very few other special books, books that celebrate the beauty of language.<br/>  I could not recommend this book any more highly.  Yes, its setting in Germany at the time of the holocaust makes for difficult reading, and the losses in this book accumulate like piles of ash posing as snow, but the love and the blessings far outweigh the sorrow.  They will leave you counting your life’s blessings, taking nothing for granted.
 Every once in a great while, I read a book that makes me want to promptly open up my Goodreads app and start confiscating stars from the nearly 400 books on my “read” shelf.  &lt;i&gt;The Book Thief&lt;/i&gt; by Markus Zusak is one of these books.  I have read a lot of books, but there are very few that come close in comparison to this one. I say this for many reasons—reasons I will attempt to convey in this review.<br/><br/>One of the most unique characteristics of &lt;i&gt;The Book Thief&lt;/i&gt; is the fact that it is narrated by Death.  In the prologue, Death describes that when he comes to collect a soul, he focuses on the color of the sky. We are introduced to Liesel, the little girl nicknamed “the book thief”, as Death recalls the colors of the sky during his three encounters with her, as he collected souls in her presence:  white, black, and red.  With this prologue, I was captivated by Death’s words and longing to know the book thief’s story.<br/><br/>&lt;i&gt;The Book Thief&lt;/i&gt; is essentially the story of a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany.  Due to her failing health and social status, Liesel’s mother takes her to live with foster parents in a small town outside of Munich.  The foster parents, the Hubermanns, are lovable characters, with Rosa (a.k.a. Mama) being a woman who pretends to be tough as nails, but has a heart of gold and Hans (a.k.a. Papa) being a soft-hearted, nurturing father figure who is Liesel’s hero in every way.  The beginning of the book is mostly about Liesel’s pre-teen years, her growing relationship with the Hubermann’s, her friendship with a boy named Rudy, and the beginnings of Liesel’s book thievery.  Starting with a book she found in the snow in a graveyard, Liesel becomes fascinated with the power of written words and the book thief is born.<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand me... &lt;i&gt;The Book Thief&lt;/i&gt; is not just a book about a girl who loves and steals books.  It’s also a chilling story about one of the darkest times for humankind, told from a perspective with which I’m not as familiar.  Every time I read a book about the Holocaust, I can’t help wondering how in the world so many people were convinced/brainwashed to allow and participate in the genocide of other human beings. Most books that I’ve read about the Holocaust are from the perspective of Jewish families facing concentration camps. This book is instead about a family who were forced to feign loyalty to Hitler, while secretly hiding a Jewish man in their basement.<br/><br/>Really, I think everyone should read this book.  It is one that I will never forget and will always treasure.  I cried until my head throbbed and my chest literally ached.  Of course, the story is sad and with the subject, of course I expected it to be.  It’s the way Markus Zusak’s words hit you right in the gut that caught me off guard.  When I read on my Kindle, I use the highlighting tool to mark phrases and paragraphs that really strike me and with this book, I found myself wanting to highlight the whole thing.  Although &lt;i&gt;The Book Thief&lt;/i&gt; will join many other books that I’ve given five star ratings to, it is definitely one of the best books I’ve ever read.
 I have to admit that I struggled a bit getting into the book and understanding exactly what was happening and who was speaking. It didn't help that I read it before bed and only read a few pages per night. That said, after re-reading some beginning sections, everything came together and I fought exhaustion every night to read as much as possible. I loved every character, including death. Just when I was shattered by one happening or a peek into a future tragedy, another came along. I wanted to know these people, love these people, protect these people, and help them find a happy ending. There is a happy ending in an important sense, but you will have to read the book to figure out what it is.
 I first saw the film based on this book with Geoffrey Rush as Hans, both film and book very good.  Balanced approach and nuanced read on that time in history.  A needed corrective to the view that all Germans supported Hitler and were actively involved in the Holocaust.  The truth is both simpler and more complex than that.  Using Death as a narrator was quite clever and the characterization of Death was very good, as well.  A couple corrections to common mistakes about that period and German history, in general, perpetuated by this novel:<br/>1."Deutschland Uber Alles", the german national anthem, sung in the story in a Nazi context, has never meant Germany over all other nations(a common misconception) but rather allegiance to the German national state rather than the particular region, duchy, principality, or free city which comprised Germany throughout most of her history prior to unification in the 19th century.  This is a phenomenon known as eidgennosenschaft(sic) in German history.<br/>2.Hitler and the Nazis never garnered near the 90% support alleged in the novel.  The highest percentage of the popular vote the Nazis ever received, in the 1932 elections, was a little over 33%, the following year it fell back to around 32%, which was when they made their move, used the conservatives and aristocrats to secure the Chancellorship after which Hitler consolidated his power and abolished opposition.  The point being that Naziism, extremism, anti-semitism is not particular to Germany or the Germans or, to paraphrase the American Thomas Sowell, the Third Reich should serve as a warning to anyone enamored of charismatic leaders and the power of rhetoric.<br/>All of which is the point of the book, i.e. the power of words, both to seduce us to evil ends and to arm us in opposition.  In Christian mythology, after all, Satan is the Master of Lies, the Deceiver who seduces us with his silver tongue to do evil.  Which, in fact, in my opinion is as good an explanation as any, novels or history, as to how Hitler came to power and the horrors that followed.<br/>Altogether, a very good read.
 Although this book was highly acclaimed in some quarters, I had a hard time finishing it.  The narrator was a clever device and the story could have been very compelling, but there was lots of extraneous material which mostly added nothing to the plot or character development.  I was left wondering why it was included; it seemed as though the author just added some random thoughts and frequently broke up the momentum of the plot.  I gave it two stars because of the narrator concept and the overall theme.  Otherwise, I would not have bothered as there are plenty of other works about WWll in Germany which are much better.
 THE BOOK THIEF has been on my shelf practically since it came out, but I kept putting it off and reading other things instead. Finally, last month, I decided to read it.<br/><br/>My conclusion?<br/><br/>*This is a beautiful book*<br/><br/>A beautifully rendered story, interesting style, and unique voice. I love the unbridled audacity of writers who are brave enough to use odd and innovative styles to tell a story.<br/><br/>Some view these new styles as too gimmicky, all show and no substance, that it’s the style rather than the story which is garnering attention.<br/><br/>My litmus test is always whether the underlying story can stand on its own without the odd stylistic choice.<br/><br/>THE NIGHT CIRCUS can’t<br/><br/>GONE GIRL can’t<br/><br/>THE BOOK THIEF most certainly can<br/><br/>It’s the story of Liesel Meminger (a character destined to go down as a classic, on par with Mary Lennox, the Darlings, and the Pevensies) in Nazi-era Munich. Liesel’s mother is giving her up, along with her younger brother who doesn’t survive the journey, to the Hubermanns, a husband and wife living on Himmel Street. He is a painter, she washes clothes and swears at people. Liesel bonds with her new papa immediately. Her new mother, though rough, treats her well and genuinely cares for her.<br/><br/>We meet Rudy, Liesel’s spunky best friend, a runner with flaxen hair who gets in trouble with her, protects her and loves her.<br/><br/>We meet the Nazi youths and witness the casual xenophobia and cruelty of the era from the eyes of a little girl.<br/><br/>We witness a gut-wrenching scene of book burning, particularly for our little book thief.<br/><br/>*NOTICE HOW I HAVEN’T MENTIONED THE USP YET?*<br/><br/>It’s because the story is strong enough on its own and doesn’t need the unique selling point of Death as Narrator.<br/><br/>As I’m sure you’re aware, the story is narrated by Death. He’s an apt choice given the horrific war in which the story is set. Death is by turns perplexed, sympathetic, apathetic, and complimentary of humans. He claims to be haunted by humans at times and seems to have been inordinately interested in Liesel and her family.<br/><br/>He is a fully omniscient narrator, knowing the past, present , and future of the characters. He can also see into them, their thoughts, motives, and inner lives, and he uses this knowledge to tease and hook the reader, telling us key future events throughout the story.<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/><br/>There’s a lot to praise here, but to name a few:<br/><br/>Liesel is a great protagonist. Believable and real. She has a streak of meanness in her that makes her very real.<br/><br/>The characters are deftly drawn across the board. Papa is a great, warm, eminently likable person. Rudy is awesome and makes a great sidekick for Liesel. Even the mayors wife and Frau Heil Hitler are well-rounded.<br/><br/>There is some beautiful prose here. One passage that caught my eye:<br/>"Trust me though, the words were on the way, and when they arrived, Liesel would hold them in her hands like the clouds, and she would wring them out like the rain."<br/><br/>There are some wondrously imaginative and moving passages. Not to spoil anything, but I especially loved the bit where Max ‘transforms’ the book for Liesel. Stunning.<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/><br/>Not much to bemoan, but I didn’t care for:<br/><br/>The constant translating from German to English. I felt like most of it could be understood from context.<br/><br/>The way it was formatted: constant paragraph breaks, centered and bold test was repetitive and began to annoy me after a while.<br/><br/>But other than those two minor gripes, which have nothing to do with content, I think this is a great book and one I will be rereading over the years.
 I LOVED this book. We started listening to the audio version in the car before I bought the paperback. My son is an audio learner, so we are constantly looking for books to listen to. We had recently listened to another WW2 book told from a kid's perspective. This was recommended to us, but we were warned the content was much more mature than the first book, even though it is also focused on a "child". While that was true, it wasn't a bad thing. I really enjoyed the narrator for the audio book, and I am quite picky. I ended up buying the paperback because I couldn't stand to wait to see what happened since I only listened with my son in the car. I was enjoying it enough to think it was worth the purchase. I'm glad I bought it. It is "heavy" but I did fall in love with the characters and know I'll be revisiting it again and again. One thing that I found unique about this book was that it was told from the view of "death", or maybe a grim reaper...but it is not in any way fantasy. Looking back, I can't imagine it being told from any other perspective and I'm so glad the author seemed to realize that too.
 This book should be required reading for anyone who thinks that there are limits to man's immunity to man.  It would have been nice if The Book Thief was a feel good story about the triumph of good over evil. This is the story of humans being hunted down like animal. If animal today were treated like the Nazis treated the Jews, PETA would go berserk. If your mind is screaming "Why didn't somebody do something?" , you would be wrong. Some people tried to save Jews by hiding them in their attics or basements. And those heroic souls paid a terrible price for their bravery. It should not have happened.
 It took me a while to understand what I was reading, but I came around. It was a strange format, and at times I was tempted to just put it down. Not as good as The Nightingale or The Lilac Girls, but I'm glad I read it. It offered a different viewpoint of a terrible time in history.
 The Book Thief is beautifully written. Markus Zusak turns a phrase and his analogies in describing scenes are poignant. Though, some say the book is for youth because the main character is young, there is no reason adults shouldn’t read it. The Diary of Anne Frank was universal.<br/><br/>The story is touching and special. It is different than other Holocaust or World War II books in challenging our assumptions and our capacity for understanding. Death narrates the story. How unique is that? Can Death be objective?<br/><br/>The story begins in 1939 Germany (and ends in 1943), as 10-year old Liesel Meminger is on a train with her mother and six-year old brother. The brother dies. They get off the train to bury him and Liesel, unable to read, picks up the book the gravedigger drops, a manual on grave digging. It is her first book theft.<br/><br/>She is to be put in the foster care of Hans and Rosa Hubermann on Himmel Street (“would anyone bomb a street named Heaven?”) in Molching, on the outskirts of Munich. They are an older couple with two grown children, the son a staunch Nazi. The reader’s – at least, mine – assumption is Liesel is Jewish, who is being rescued by a non-Jewish couple, but she is not Jewish. There are inferences later that her father might have been a Communist.<br/><br/>Liesel calls Hans and Rosa Mamma and Papa. The loose end is the neighbors unquestioning about this when they know there were two older children.<br/><br/>Rosa is acerbic and verbally abusive toward her husband and Liesel. Hans is the calming influence, tending to Liesel when she is awoken by nightmares, using the time to teach her to read, using the gravedigger’s manual.<br/><br/>Despite the tenor of Nazi Germany and specter of war, the children of Himmel Street engage in the innocence of childhood. Liesel becomes immediate friends with the boy next door, Rudy Steiner, and she is the only girl in the street soccer games. Rudy gained fame a few years earlier, when he was so impressed by Jesse Owen’s four gold medal performance in the 1936 Berlin Olympics, he painted his face and went to a local track to copy Owens. That did not go over well.<br/><br/>The children attend school and obligatory Hitler Youth meetings. Everybody hangs Nazi flags on Hitler’s birthday. You don’t hear the children utter Anti-Semitic comments, so maybe in this corner of Nazidom, these German children weren’t accepting the brainwashing propaganda. Rudy gets in trouble with the Hitler Youth leader when he tries to explain Tommy Müller can’t keep in goosestep because he is hard of hearing.<br/><br/>Hans’ application to the Nazi Party has been rejected or delayed and he doesn’t seem to care. As a painter, many of his customers were Jews. Now that the Jewish neighborhood has been ransacked, he no longer has work.<br/><br/>A Jewish man saved Hans’ life in World War I, which cost the man his. Now, the parallel story begins. Twenty years later, the man’s 22-year old son, Max Vandenburg, shows up at the Hubermann’s door. You expected Rosa to yell at Hans, saying they are at danger if they hide Max. Instead she feeds Max soup. Her manner changes from that point.<br/><br/>A special relationship develops between the two protected people. He, too, is haunted by nightmares. There are great differences. He is hidden in the basement. Liesel has a room upstairs. Max must be a secret. Liesel can go out and live. She brings him the crossword puzzles from the newspaper. He asks for weather reports, since he can’t even look outside.<br/><br/>With war arriving, rationing hits Germany, too (just as in Europe and America). Rudy and Liesel join gangs going on expeditions stealing apples from farms. Liesel, with Rudy often as lookout, steals books from the Mayor’s wife’s library. Meanwhile, Max is sketching and writing a book about his experience, The Word Shaker, to be given to Liesel at another time. Words and books play a central role, and a reference is made to Hitler coming to power on words.<br/><br/>The challenge is can we identify with these people? After all, they are German. Germany was the enemy. That was difficult with the movie, Das Bot. What comes across in The Book Thief, is there are innocents in all wars on all sides, and it’s usually children. Once when their end of Himmel Street is in a bomb shelter, Rudy’s father is able to coax everyone to hold hands.<br/><br/>“From other shelters, there were stories of singing “Deutschland über Alles”…No such thing happened in the Fielder shelter. In that place, there was only fear and apprehension…The cold hands melted into the warm ones, and in some cases, the feeling or another human pulse was transported. It came through the layers of pale, stiffened skin. Some of them closed their eyes, waiting for their final demise, or hoping for a sign that the raid was finally over…Did they deserve any better, these people? How many had actively persecuted others, high on the scent of Hitler’s gaze, repeating his sentences, his paragraphs, his opus? Was Rosa Hubermann responsible? The hider of a Jew? Or Hans? Did they all deserve to die? The children? The answer to each of these questions interests me very much, though I cannot allow them to seduce me…I pitied them, though not as much as I felt for the ones I scooped up from various camps in that time. The Germans in basements were pitiable, surely, but at least they had a chance. They were not sent there for a shower. For those people, life was still achievable.”
 Like most real works of art, I did not understand it nor particularly like it at first.  "The Book Thief "starts out with a most horrible scene from near the end of the book and morphs into a book long flashback, starting with the death of young girl's brother on the way to being left with a foster family. As we soon learn, the narrator throughout the book is Death, him/her-self.<br/><br/>Who would want to read a depressing book like that? But we keep reading and quickly find that the book thief, hungry for words even more than for food, is the girl, who steals her first book on the way to her foster parents.  Some relationships themes begin to appear - the girl has dreams, of her brother, and of Hitler (who seems to be the root cause of her plight, and of the hate - that counters the developing love growing from the increasing number of relationships). Her stepfather, a really good hearted painter, who plays accordion when he is jobless, as often he is Hitler's Germany, sits with the girl on her bed at night and reads to her all night if necessary, till sleep overcomes the fear from her dream. In the daytime he teaches her to read.<br/><br/>Other growing love themes appear, battling a growing darkness - 1) Her best friend, a boy (Rudy) who wants to be Jesse Owens, who wants (but never gets) a kiss, and who helps her steal more books from a rich woman's library. The older boy, a Jew, they are hiding in the basement, whom she nurses back health and falls in love with - unrequited when he runs away, is eventually is caught, and is marched to Dachau. Then the hate begins to win as air raids are called, surrounding cities are bombed, and finally - by mistake - their little town is completely destroyed. (This hate raining from the sky is not from Hitler, but from the American bombers - collateral damage - all part of hateful war). The girl, Liesel, was one of the few survivors, because she was in the basement finishing a book about her life, called "The Book Thief" - Dead were her foster father and mother (whom by that time she also loved) and Rudy (who finally got his kiss, on dead lips).  About this time I am thinking three things: 1) the character development must have been great, because I am actually shedding tears for these people, 2) This is the scene at the start of the book, and 3) Death is narrating this book because he had picked up Liesel's book and read it many times over the years before Liesel's own death when he could return it.<br/><br/>Lest you think the book ends on a sour note, there is also an Epilog, wherein the Jewish boy, Max, (now hardship tested man) survives and returns to look for Liesel (now a beautiful young lady), and wherein Liesel dies many years later in Australia, having many children and grandchildren (we are left to guess that they were also Max's).<br/><br/>PS I forgot to say something about "Death" - not clear whether a he or she, some charcteristics of both. I will use a generic "he". It was Death's job to gather the souls and carry them to their next destination - he did this with care and empathy, and it was especially a hard job during war time - he "needed a vacation". But he was fascinated by humans - he was "always overestimating or underestimating them". His last statement was: "I am haunted by humans".
 The trouble with reading a book that’s been out for awhile – in this case, 7 years – is that you’re bound to hear something about it. I knew going into it that The Book Thief was about World War II, that the main character was a little girl and that it was set in Germany. Aside from those facts, I’d heard rave reviews and things like “this book deserves six stars” and saw a TON of 5-star reviews.<br/><br/>It’s almost like setting yourself up for failure sometimes. The expectations are so very high!<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed The Book Thief. It was my book club selection for December, and it had a ton of great discussion points and depth to dig into.<br/><br/>My favorite aspect of the novel was the narrator. The Book Thief is told from Death’s perspective. As in, the grim reaper, so to speak, is telling the story and talking about his encounters with Liesel Meminger, a young orphan sent to live with a new family on Himmel (heaven) street in small town in Germany.<br/><br/>The way death describes himself, his role in the war and the extraordinary life of Liesel is breathtaking. I did find some parts to drag, especially when you KNEW something was going to happen and waiting for it to actually take place is sweet torture.<br/><br/>That’s another part of the story I found fascinating: Death would often tell you what was going to happen later in the story. He would basically provide the book’s own spoilers, and it’s so unusual and unexpected that it didn’t spoil anything, really, because you’re too busy puzzling out…wait did that just happen? And, do I believe it?!<br/><br/>Told with both a non-Jewish German and Jewish German insights, I found The Book Thief a very eye-opening look at how Hitler’s reign affected the people in his country. The propaganda and the fear and the non-support of Hitler was surprising and I love how the author challenged the typical view of how Germans felt and reacted to the war.<br/><br/>Liesel and Hans Hubermann were my favorite characters and their relationship one of my all-time favorites in literature. The sweet building of trust and love between them is so moving and beautiful.<br/><br/>I love that they each help each other – to read, to open up and to heal.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is brutal and harsh without being overly graphic or without purpose. You’re heart strings will most definitely be tugged, but I like how everything is described and woven together so well.<br/><br/>Also, by “heart strings be tugged” what I mean is ripped out, stomped on and then run over. So yeah, prepare yourself.<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/><br/>The best favor you can do yourself is don’t read any (more) reviews. Just go into it as fresh as possible. The Book Thief has a lot of offer: heart, spirit, the triumph of human will and persistence. Read it, love it, steal some books of your own. But, definitely read The Book Thief.
 I can't actually remember if there was violence or not, as it has been a while since I read it. But I mean, it's about the Holocaust, so yeah, a little emotionally traumatic. I love this book and it is one of my favorites. You will not regret reading it far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>Edit: POSSIBLE SPOILERS: Also, it's a story about a girl from the perspective of the grim reaper in WWII. She loses her mother and has to live with a foster family. She likes to read and steals books from I believe the Mayor's house. This is at a time when the Hitler Youth were burning books so I believe it was dangerous to have them. It's an interesting story, especially when her foster father repays an old debt by sheltering a Jew from the Nazis. There's a movie out, has been out about three years now I believe.
 When I saw the movie version of The Book Thief was coming out I thought it was the perfect time to finally read my copy of the book that has been sitting on my shelf for some time. With all the lovely reviews I have read I was sure I would love it as well and I was definitely not disappointed. While I cannot say that it is a feel good read in any way it is an incredibly beautiful story and one who's characters I will never forget.<br/><br/>First and foremost the narrator of this incredible story is death himself. He's not the usual scythe and darkness death we have seen before but a death who is just doing his job and trying not to get too distracted by the strange lives of the living he passes by. There is a heart beating in that cold chest, one that cannot turn away from our main character, Liesel Meminger, a girl who refuses to let this horrid life she has been born into break her spirit. It might sound strange but, with all the war stories I have read in my lifetime, it is this book narrated by death that presents the most humane and heartbreaking story yet.<br/><br/>Liesel is another wholly unique character. Made to go live with foster parents when the Communist label attached to her family becomes too dangerous, Liesel's younger brother dies on the way to their new home. Finding a book in the snow by her brother's grave, Liesel steals the book and resolves to learn how to read it. It is with this first theft that Liesel resolves to steal words when the world takes things from her. However words become so much more to our young heroine: a bridge connecting her to her foster Papa, Hans Hubermann; a way to escape the horrors happening around her, both figuratively and literally; a way to emotionally relate and communicate to the young Jewish man the Hubermanns hide in their basement. For someone who love words as well I became very attached to Liesel and her various ways of dealing with the unpredictable, often hypocritical world she had to try and navigate. How else might a young German girl, a member of the local Hitler Young group, deal with the unwarranted hatred she sees being thrown at Jewish people like the young man in their basement she has come to love like family?<br/><br/>I couldn't end this review without mentioning the other unforgettable characters that saturate this story. By far my favorite character is Liesel's best friend, Rudy Steiner, a young boy always willing to do what his heart feels is right, regardless of the danger it might present for himself, and a boy who wants nothing more than a kiss from Liesel. I don't want to give too much away regarding their sweet, innocent relationship but I will advise you prepare and have some tissues when you begin reading the last 50 pages or so of the story. Another unforgettable character is Papa, a man who seems to have unlimited amounts of kindness and another character who refuses to let the propaganda of the Fuhrer dement what he knows to be the right way to be. There are so many more remarkable characters - Max, the young Jew in the basement, Liesel's harsh yet caring Mama, Rosa, the many colorful characters inhabiting Himmel Street - and this collection of humanity makes the ending of the book that much more poignant. I've never quite read anything like it.<br/><br/>Anyone who loves reading history from an alternative viewpoint, especially history dealing with WWII, would be remise not to read this book. This is a powerful, beautiful, bittersweet story. It's the kind of story that you will not only never forget but one that, once you have read it, will make you forget what it was like to have not known and loved these characters. Truly a life changing story.
 A poetic melodrama about poor Germans during WW11. Strange use of words, especially verbs, and metaphors that work sometimes while unsuccessful at others. I started it twice before getting into it, then could not put it down. Lovely, sad, powerful, with an unlikely heroine I won't soon forget. Overall one of the best books I have read in the past few years.
 It is not a quick read, and certainly not a light one, but well worth the effort. I would not say I enjoyed this book because that verb is just not properly descriptive. This book is experienced or ruminated over or felt or something. The imagery is diverse and evocative, sometimes ethereal, and occasionally bizarre. The writing style is unique, infrequently downright odd, but always interesting and creative.<br/><br/>The interwoven lives of the characters are complex, amazing, and disturbing. Of course, how could a story set in World War II era Germany fail to be complex and disturbing.<br/><br/>The narrater is death. Yes, death. Not an unwise choice to narrate a war story. Death, as you may imagine, is rather busy in a time of war.<br/><br/>The main protagonist is a young girl, Liesel, the daughter of communists (hint: not a good thing to be in Nazi Germany). Her world is chock full of strange, interesting, and odd characters, from her foul mouthed foster mother and contrastingly gentle foster father, to various acquaintances on Himmel Street outside Munich. Although death tells the story, it is mostly presented as the story of Liesel and the people that were or are a part of her young life. Liesel, not surprisingly, experiences much death and loss, in general. However, the better side of humanity is illustrated in both large and small ways all around her.
 "I am haunted by humans."<br/><br/>The sensationalism that clings to so many books often keeps me from reading them, and no matter how many times I'm proven wrong, I still resist 'til I'm pushed over the edge and--sometimes grudgingly--finally pick up the book, open it, and begin to read. Because, really, how can so many people love a story that much and be right? That's the cynic in me, always doubting--and yet I love them all, even the ones that I disliked.<br/><br/>Between the beautiful writing and the lovely heartache of the story, it's a book that haunts, and I can see why so many people love it. And no matter how warily I began reading it, by the end, I was crying with the best of them. This is not only worth reading, but it's a must.
 This book is narraited by an unusual Teller of Tales.  His name is Death.  During the times of Hitler he was kept too busy, but he is always busy.  More so in Hitler's Germany?  Maybe yes, maybe no.<br/><br/>When the book begins, Liesel Meminger is ten, her little brother is six.  The children are being taken from their mother, she may have been a Communist.  The two are going to a small city in Bavaria.  Little brother takes sick and dies along the way.  He is buried one cold snowy day in an obscure graveyard.  Liesel finds a book concerning Grave Digging.  She steals it, yet she has never learned to read.  She does learn and very well Death tells his readers.  Liesel meets her foster parents, Rosa and Hans Hubermann.  Rosa is sharp tongued and quick with a slap, but as time passes readers find this is just a facade.  She's a good hearted woman.  Hans is tender and fatherly to the young girl.  He will help her learn to read though he's not a reader, not well educated.  He's a great accordian player, the best in the world.  Himmel Street is in the poor section of the city.  Rosa washes and irons for townspeople, but too many can afford to keep her services.  Characters are poor and becoming poorer.  Rosa has a right to be always angry.<br/><br/>Liesel is a rough, tough little tomboy.  She has to be to be able to live through all this.  A world twisted with hate.  She is placed in the baby class in school, too old but can't read.  She transfers to her own age group by fussing about studying with little kids.  Her best friend is Rudy Steiner, a rebel, his own person, a neat kid, refuses to be dominated.  Liesel hangs with Rudy and his friends, a boyfriend, girlfriend, yes and no.  No girlfriends for Liesel.  The group steals food, they are always hungry, never get enough good nourishing food and are happy to get what little they so get.  So many Germans are hungry, poor, without hope.  As for Liesel, she steals books.  She doesn't want them as gifts, she's rather steal them.  She loves her nickname The Book Thief and revels in her stealing.<br/><br/>Characters are poor but there are moments of joy, of appreciation of what little they do have.  The beautiful weather, pretty days, the beautiful blue sky filled with lovely white clouds, friends, the happiness of all getting together, the joy of life itself.  These characters do not know whether tomorrow will ever come for them.  So much bombing, so much killing.  Death is always close.  Liesel thinks of how her little brother will always be six.  So many others will die too young.<br/><br/>A Jew, Max Vandenburg is hidden in the Hubermann's cellar.  All must be kept quiet.  Years ago, Max's father did a big favor for Hans.  Hans wants to return the favor.  But the family, Mama, Pap, Liesel will be killed if found out.  Max becomes a friend to Liesel.  He makes her homemade gifts, more valuable thant store bought.  Max is very creative.<br/><br/>All young people must join the Hitler Youth.  It is not an option.  Fathers and sons are called into the military, all able bodied man must go.  Death lurks about, always telling his stories.<br/><br/>This is the second book I have read, one after the other about the Second World War fought in the European Theater.  God read especially for young people, though very sad.
 I'll admit it, I saw the movie first.  After seeing it I went straight to the library and borrowed the book.  I have always been meaning to buy it, and when I saw this unusual cover art I knew that I had to have it.....the image of Liesel dancing with Death is a very powerful one.  The book itself is a fast read, but there are times when you just have to stop for a minute and take it all in (good times and bad).  It's heart-wrenching though, so although I don't read it often I do think that it is a very well-written novel, and it is one of my favorites.
 I read books constantly so I'm probably a fairly tough reviewer to impress. This book is well written, creatively rendered, and appears realistically described. Interestingly, the narrator is Death, and the story line  isn't "happily ever after." After all, the setting is in Germany during the Second World War. Liesel, the main character, is quite engaging and one can't help becoming a bit attached to her and anxious to know what will happen to her next. This isn't technically a young adult (teen) book, though some would enjoy it. It's amazing to me how few Americans read much, and some teens today may not be particularly excited about tackling a book over 500 pages long.
 One of the most gripping books I have read.  It rates bookshelf placement with Anne Frank's Diary and other books written about the Holocaust. The reality of concentration camps and genocide of WWII cannot be denied. Yet, there are those that claim these atrocities did not happen....  Today, we have those who want to tear down statues and rename streets because they are reminders of the Confederate Union during our American Civil War... Yes, the Civil War time was a major pivotal and tragic event that divided, changed, and still seems to polarize our nation. Slavery was wrong.  But let us live with that reality, and not try to erase the shame of the enslavement of human beings from our history!<br/>Instead of destroying historical statues, monuments, street signs and other items that remind us of the trauma, bloodshed, hardship and horror of the Civil War... we need to be reminded of our past mistakes,  Why not instead add Interpretive Signs at these historical markers to explain the history... the mistakes we made,  and explain the history behind the times and the people.
 Slow goings at the beginning, for many hundred pages u wonder if it will ever take off. It does. Stick with it. It's a book lover's feel good book. Recognizes what book lovers recognize and know. Kinda vindicates you. However, not a book I'd say is an absolute MUST read. Warm and will make you cry too. Love story is very pretty and innocent. Recommended for young-at-hearts. The death as narrator is what caught my attention, reminded me a little about what I've heard of Neil gaiman's works, but I guess a more serious literature take on his narrative style?
 I loved this book - everything about it. I love the format and the narrator and the characters. I was heart broken and begging for it to stop, all the while hoping that it never did. It was beautiful. I loved it so much that I bought a copy for a friend before I even finished it. Personally, I would hard pressed to let younger readers have a go at it - not for difficulty of the reading, but for difficulty of content.
 Phenomenal book!!! The writing is tremendous and the characters are ones that will live in in your heart far after you have finished reading the book. Liesel, Rudy and Max and even Hans and Rosa become  like friends and family as the book progresses. I put off reading this for over 10 years because of its length and I must admit that was a stupid mistake. Truly hated for it to come to an end. Take the time to read it... It will end up in your top 5 favorite books I am pretty sure. Great story and a good  description of what times were like during the Second World War. Shows that not all Germans agreed with Hitler and his demented actions and beliefs but that they did what they had to for survival....
 Beautiful book, well written.  Knew from the beginning I was going to like it. The start was so different.  Death as narrator, speaking in cryptical outlines of words, using colors to describe his most memorable moments with the book thief...red, white, black.  However, I was sleepy when I began THE BOOK THIEF the first time, and only made it through half of chapter one.  When I picked it up again, I started over and continued. The story takes form by chapter two, then I couldn't stop reading.  May vivid word pictures.<br/><br/>Rosa Hubermann...possessed the unique ability to aggravate almost anyone she ever met.<br/><br/>Papa's face...it traveled and wondered, but it disclosed no answers.  Not yet.<br/><br/>"You stink," Mama would say..."like cigarettes and kerosene."  Sitting in the water, she (Liesel) imagines the smell of it, mapping out on her papa's clothes.  More than anything, it was the smell of friendship, and she could find it on herself too.  Liesel loved that smell.  She would sniff her arm and smile as the water cooled around her.<br/><br/>In the years to come, he would be a giver or bread, not a stealer -- proof again of the contradictory human being.  So much good, so much evil.  Just add water.<br/><br/>His fingers smelled of suitcase, metal, Mein Kampf, and survival.<br/><br/>"You said nothing....Not a 'goodbye.' Not a 'thank you.' Not a 'that's the most beautiful sight I've ever seen.' Nothing!" Certainly, she was a book thief, but that didn't mean she should have no manners at all.  It didn't mean she couldn't be polite.<br/><br/>This book is worth your time.  Read it.
 The Book Thief tells the story of young girl Liesel Meminger growing up in Nazi Germany during the Second World War. The book is narrated by Death who complains about all the work he has to do picking up the souls of the deceased during that period.<br/>The story starts with Death taking the soul of Leisel's younger brother as he dies when Leisel , her brother and mother are travelling on a train through the snow. Leisel is left with a foster family the Hebermanns in the village Molching not far from Munich. Hans Hebermann reveals himself as one who cares deeply about people helping Leisel and showing compassion for the Jews. Hans's wife Rosa first appears as a hard character but she also shows compassion towards Leisel and later Max a Jew who the Hebermanns shelter in their basement.<br/>As the ordeal of the war starts to have more and more effect on the people of Molching Leisel develops a deep interest in books, which she steals, and words. She is also helped by a developing relationship with a young boy her age Rudy. Rudy is a rebel who brings disgrace initially by his devotion to Jesse Owens the great black athlete. Leisel's love of words is further developed by a relationship with the Mayor's wife.<br/>The book is a refreshing story of the fate of ordinary people during war. All the central characters care about other people but face the terrible problems of a nation gone mad with nationalism. That nation was of course Germany but who has not seen the seeds of this fanaticism even in countries like the US, UK and  Australia.<br/>A theme throughout the book is the power of words.  Hitler, Leisel and Max all use words to great effect. None more so than however than the author Marcus Zusak .<br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/The-Book-Thief/dp/0375842209/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Book Thief</a>
 My daughter had to read this book for AP Englsh, and I got her this audio version to use as she read along. While she is brilliant in most subjects, she really doesn't do very well with literature. It really helped her to understand this novel better. (But yes, I still made her read the book with it)  This is such a good story.  I recommend it for anyone.  The narration was done very well and the story kept myself and my daughter very engaged.  It led to some very good discussions, which in turn helped her to complete her project for the book.  I'm really glad it was required reading for my daughter's class. It is a fiction story in the setting of WWII Germany.  The characters are complex and evolving.  I'm sure you can find plenty of reviews of this book on-line.  But my opinion is that it was a great book on audio.  The narration was perfect and it was well worth every penny.  I will put this in my car and listen to it again as i drive.  Further, the item arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.
 Possible review titles:<br/>  o When a story is narrated by Death, you know it will be grim<br/>  o I read the last 20 pages through my tears.<br/>  o Emotional and touching without being manipulative.<br/><br/>On the late 1930's train ride to Munich where she will live as an orphan with two strangers, Liesel Meminger's little brother dies. When Death comes to gather her brother's soul he first takes notice of Liesel and takes an interest in her and the family; he will come across her two more times.<br/><br/>Markus Zusak paints a vivid portrait of the decline in Germany's fortunes from the start of World War II through 1943. Times are especially difficult for a family of a man who does not join the Nazi party. We see the treatment of Jews as they are lead to Dachau outside of Munich and in other instances. Liesel and her best friend Rudy are always hungry (everyone is always hungry) and do their best to survive.<br/><br/>The plot is compelling, the characters are real and the descriptions are exquisite. I especially like the conceit of having Death narrate the story. He is not someone to be feared; rather, he is just taking up the souls of those killed by other humans. It's a full time job and he is wearied by it.<br/><br/>I finished this book at the coast in a house we were staying at with friends. I had to go in another room to finish this novel because I was tearing up and ended up practically blubbering. The last book that did that to me was "Terms of Endearment" by Larry McMurtry in the 1980s.<br/><br/>This makes two 5-star books I've read in the past month.  This makes two 5-star books I've read in the past month. But it's not just me giving an undeserved rave review; it has well over 4 stars on Amazon with over 13,800 reviews given.<br/><br/>It is also the fifth book out of the last 8 I've read that has war as the main character or at least as a backdrop. I'll stay with the theme for a while longer.
 I bought this book and his next one, Bridge of Clay, based on a review I read in the Denver Post.  I have to admit I thought it started a bit slow.  In my opinion it jumped around and I initially struggled to get engaged.  When i was about 20% into it (electronic) it grabbed me.  I guess I finally figured out who was who and more importantly who was the Book Thief.  I really enjoyed it!  I fear others may not stick with it.  I found Bridge of Clay to start in the same way but it also grabs you!  Give this book a chance.
 The Book Thief tells the tale of Liesel Meminger, a girl who loses one family only to gain another. How she becomes dubbed The Book Thief. How she slowly gains an understanding of Germany and the Nazis and the wrongness of it all. How her family comes to hide a Jewish man, Max, in their basement despite all risks. And how Max transformed her life completely and defined her in a whole new light. It's a tale of sorrow and joy, of friendship and love, of bravery and acceptance.<br/><br/>'I witness the ones that are left behind, crumbled among the jigsaw puzzles of realization, despair, and surprise. They have punctured hearts. They have beaten lungs.'<br/><br/>The Book Thief's use of Death as the narrator is not only thoroughly alluring in concept alone but it serves to utilizes dark humor to lighten the saddest of situations. Death is not the cold and emotionless specter you would expect him to be though. He's unintentionally humorous, and has a fascination for humans despite his awareness of his need to remain impartial. He seeks meaning in his work and becomes mesmerized by the interesting and courageous humans, Liesel being one of them.<br/><br/>"...to prove to myself that you, and your human existence, are worth it."<br/><br/>The symbolism is rife within these pages. Most importantly is Liesel and her book thieving. She remains blissfully naive of what is truly going on in the world until April 20, 1940 when a book burning was organized in the town square to celebrate Hitler's birthday. She discovers things that greatly impact her and change her outlook on what has happened in her life up till that point and swiftly regards Hitler as her enemy. She steals a book from the pyre to mark the occasion. The book thieving continued after that but it wasn't just a bad childish habit, it became a symbol for her resistance to the Nazi regime and specifically to Hitler and all he had done. Each book stolen became a symbol of hope for a better future in the post-Holocaust world.<br/><br/>I've only recently become drawn to stories of war, the majority of those I've read have been based around WWII, and The Book Thief is absolutely one of the very best. I loved that it was told from the point of view of a German sympathetic to the Jews which made it immediately different than any of the others I had read. Possessing richly drawn characters is what makes this story absolutely unforgettable. Liesel and Rudy, Hans and Rosa, and of course Max...their cumulative story will forever live on in my mind.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is an emotional tale regarding the power of words and how that power can be used for good or bad, depending on how you choose to use them.
 This is one of my favorite novels ever.  However, I am taking off a star for the "enhanced movie tie in" stuff.  It was offered on sale so I bought it because I knew I wanted to read it before I saw the movie.  Only the enhanced version was on sale.  What that meant was that I couldn't read it on my chrome box.  I read books on two computers (one is a windows machine and the other is a chrome box), my Kindle paperwhite, and, occasionally, on my Android phone. So I was very frustrated to realize I couldn't read this book on my chrome box.  And really, when I'm reading a book, I don't want to stop and look at videos of the related movie.  I don't want the pictures from the movie to infect my reading until I'm done with the book.  So I never did use the links provided for that.  They were just an encumbrance.<br/><br/>I don't want this to take away from the novel itself, though.  The characters are  complex.  The are a wonderful mixture of thoughtless and compassionate, grumpy and unselfish.  I believe that is what people are really like but it is so seldom that they are portrayed that way.  This is a great book.
 A truly unique book.  For one thing, the narrator is Death, and even though we are talking Germany in the 1940s, he is a sympathetic character.  He collects the souls of all those people who are thus out of the war and horror.<br/><br/>But the book thief does not get off so easily.  Liesel Meminger is a ten-year-old German girl, her mother is taking her and her little brother on a train somewhere, and her brother coughs and dies.  For reasons that are artfully told, the first book she steals is "The Grave Digger's Handbook," even though she can't read.<br/><br/>The whole story is artfully told, with no spoiler alerts needed: our narrator tells spoilers all along the way, but it doesn't spoil a thing.  We know early on that Liesel will live to be an old lady, but we don't know how or why those around her will die.  Each one gets his or her own very special appointment with the narrator.<br/><br/>One of the unusual things about the book is the use of typographical interruptions which look almost like section headings, but are not.  They are the narrator's interruptions of his own narrative and the narrative of Liesel's book, which is named "The Book Thief."  So OK, this is Liesel's book but it is Death's book, too.<br/><br/>And it is Max's book.  Max Vandenburg is the Jew who comes to hide in the basement of the Hubermanns' basement.  Hans and Rosa Hubermann are Liesel's foster-parents.  That's where Liesel's mother was taking her and her little brother that day, because her mama could not take care of her any longer.  We don't find out why for quite a few chapters.<br/><br/>Then there's Rudy, the boy next door.  The Steiners have a great many children, but Rudy's the only one we really get to know.  He's strong and fast and smart and kind and becomes Liesel's best friend.  He's also a bit strange, like when he painted himself black and ran around the racetrack pretending he was Jesse Owens.  That turned out to have some far-reaching consequences.<br/><br/>Consequences of the character's actions are much of what the story is about, and especially consequences of kindness in the world of Nazi Germany.  Of course there are horrors, but they are not the focus.  The focus is love and courage and all sorts of good character traits people don't even know they have until they need them.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this book to anyone, young or old.
 Death makes an awesome narrator, and I just loved this book. I tried reading it to my 11 year old, but he was in the mood for something a lot sillier.  However, what we did read about it interested him....I just had to explain a lot of history in age appropriate terms to help him understand the fervor of Hitler and the plight of the Jews.
 The Book Thief  has been on my Amazon Wishlist for ages; published several years ago and a New York Times bestseller for now a second go-around, it seemed like good summer reading. Okay, so a novel about Nazi Germany might not be everyone's idea of a beach book, but what can I say? And from the first page, I was (dare I say?) enchanted by the narrator: Death. A kinder and gentler death, to be sure, but Death all the same. It was a poignant and powerful device.<br/><br/>Liesel Meminger is on her way to a new life with a foster family. The year is 1938; her father, a communist, has disappeared with the advent of Nazi rule, and her mother fears she'll be next. So Liesel and her little brother are off to Molching, a small village just outside of Munich. Hans and Rosa Huberman were anxiously expecting them and the small stipend that would accompany the children, stretching the family dollar a little further. But  little Werner dies along the way, leaving just his big sister to meet her foster family--and refusing, once she arrives, to budge from the placement agency's car.<br/><br/>We know from the first that Herr Huberman, Papa, is one special man. He coaxes Liesel from the car, shows her how to roll a cigarette for him. He plays the accordion and brings life into their cramped home. He helps Liesel navigate around the treacherous Frau Huberman, whose swearing and yelling and name-calling are legendary. But perhaps most important of all, Papa teaches Liesel how to read--he paints letters and words on the walls in the cellar and pours over the book Liesel found at her brother's gravesite: The Grave Digger's Handbook. (Other than that one teensy spoiler, I'll let you discover who the book thief is and how the books are stolen.)<br/><br/>Liesel navigates school and afternoon soccer matches in the street and wins the heart of Rudy Steiner, friend and confidant extraordinaire. She helps Mama deliver the laundry, attends her Hitler Youth troop--and marches in parades and sings Deutschland Deutschland Uber Alles and shouts "Heil, Hitler." I think this might be the first novel I've ever read set in Germany in World War II where the main character is an active participant in Nazi life and it was a bit of a shock. But very little in this world is black and white, and Liesel soon finds out that life in Nazi Germany is many shades of gray.<br/><br/>Zusak scatters the pages of his novel with unexpected lists, labels, and asides. Here's the list that begins Part One: "himmel street--the art of saumensching--an ironfisted woman--a kiss attempt--jesse owens--sandpaper--the smell of friendship--a heavyweight champion--and the mother of all watschens". There are also two handwritten and illustrated books, one written by Liesel and one by a Jewish friend of hers. Which probably should have alerted me to the fact that The Book Thief  is marketed as a Young Adult novel. But because it's been several years since the book was first published, I either forgot or totally missed the initial hype (Read: I had no idea what this book was really about) and was fairly surprised at the target audience.<br/><br/>Young adult fiction or no, The Book Thief  is poignant and thought-provoking and beautifully crafted.
 This is very fresh on my mind.  I finished The Book Thief five minutes ago.  As you can see, I could not wait to give my humble opinion of this book.  So, as I wipe the tears from my cheeks, I will collect myself and try to give you a proper review.<br/>First, this is another book I wasn't sure about.  There are so many people who have told me how wonderful this book is that I was a bit skeptical.  After all, I have run into the experience where I have heard how wonderful a book is from so many people and it's just not wonderful at all.  Of course, this can go both ways.  I've heard people hate books that I love.  Anyways, I wasn't disappointed in The Book Thief at all.<br/>I would like to say that it does deal with a part of history that speaks to me.  I study my family history and I have found that I am part Romani on my mother's side.  The Romani were also persecuted alongside people of Jewish decent.  So, I will say that the book immediately had my interest because of that.<br/>Going into this book, I hoped that the characters would be rich with varying personalities.  Not only did I love the main character, Liesel but I loved all of the other characters as well.  It struck me that Markus Zusak has a wonderful gift where he is able to give his characters such drastically different personalities and still be able to have them intermingle in such a beautiful way because of this gift, I was more engaged in this book than I have been with any other in a long time.<br/>Also, The Book Thief is very emotionally charged.  I was not kidding when I said that I was wiping tears from my eyes at the beginning of this blog.  I literally was.  Thankfully, the emotions are negative, positive and everything in between.<br/>Also, I am very glad to say that I got a true glimpse into the world at that time.  The fear and the ability to find the happiness within the darkest and most evil of times was wonderfully represented.  The stories showed such a strong sense of human endurance.  Also, they proved that not everything is right or wrong.  There are a lot of gray areas.  To say that I love The Book Thief is an understatement.  I will be watching the movie tomorrow.  So, obsessed is a good word for how I feel about this beautiful collection of words.  I recommend The Book Thief to everyone.
 I gave this a five (5) star rating in the material, information and writing.<br/>The book setting was during war time when anything could have happened, but especially to the Jewish community and anyone who would dare to put themselves in danger and the face of death.<br/><br/>A family saga of a young girl and her friends, neighbors and acquaintances all that surround her in time of tribulations.<br/>Of a mad man,  what he accomplishes with getting the masses to follow his words.  He gets everyone in this drama to focus on all bad and hate of others by raising in everyone around his own hatred and blames of all wrongs on one race.<br/>It seems death looms over many and special people stand up to take responsibly to be silent hero's.<br/><br/>It shows us love in many forms and when a parent has to save a child, what pains one must go through.<br/>A young child is given to another and grows up within another's family, making it her own.<br/>A few special people helping her get through this terrible time in history and how she makes life a little special for others, passing forward the good that has been passed to her.<br/><br/>I can only tell you this is a very moving story of a horrific time in history which I cried out load and yelled within myself as to the<br/>horrors we humans don't believe another human being is capable of or having so many follow his inhuman ways.<br/>To blame one community in a mass society that evil lucks in one more than another, is incredible to me.<br/>I again hope for humanity to learn by past errors and take note on how to prevent these atrocities from ever again happening.<br/>I am appalled at what we allow others to rule us by and the need to belong with a group even when we have the knowledge it is wrong. Deigning all yet fearing the worst is yet upon us or here.<br/>We should be free thinkers for ourselves, think kindly for all, not thinking one is superior to another.<br/><br/>I do recommend this book so no one forgets our past and helps make our future better for all of humanity.<br/>Thank you.
 Actual Rating: 3.5 out of 5<br/><br/>I suspect that I went into reading this book with the wrong expectations. (Which is one of the things I’ve heard people say you shouldn’t have at all. Have standards, not expectations.)<br/><br/>Simply by walking around with The Book Thief in hand, I had random people stop and tell me how amazing it was. I was expecting something with more action and a bit of a greater climax to it. Not a type of slice-of-life of a family in Nazi Germany. (Though to be fair, having Death narrate the story certainly gave it more interest.) Had I gone into it expecting something more calm, (or again, not expecting anything at all), I feel like I would have been more satisfied at the end. Knowing this, I won’t dock it much.<br/><br/>The most prominent feature of the book is its writing. It’s weird (a good weird), as it uses words in a very different way, sometimes departing completely from their original meaning to paint a somehow even more vivid picture. (EX: A “split pulse”, a “dripping sun”.)<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the book was its ending. It’s abrupt and hardly even comes to a proper close. Not only that, but a multitude of lose ends were left untouched. There are never even vaguely tied up. There is no follow up at all on where the main character’s life went from point A to point B, or the side characters for that matter. Despite this frenzy, the climax doesn’t even feel climactic. You’re told that it happens in advance, and there’s no tension to it.<br/><br/>For its calm air, unique writing, docked a point and a half for unresolved point points and an anti-climactic climax, The Book Thief scores a 3.5 out of 5.
 I’ve wanted to read The Book Thief for a while but I was pretty scared of it. I mean everyone seems to love this book. Really, really love this book. So I was very nervous. I bought it back in 2013 and basically it just sat on my Kindle untouched. That’s until I was finally pushed to read it by a friend. Was it my favorite book? No. But it was a really powerful, truthful book about a really bad part of history. There were a lot of pages and some slow moments, but all in all a great story with a really good main character.<br/><br/>It’s hard to really explain what The Book Thief is about. Everyone pretty much knows what was happening in Nazi Germany in the 1940s. We’ve all had the history lessons and have seen the movies and read the books. It was an awful time where a lot of lives were lost. On the surface one would think The Book Thief is just another to add to the pile. But it wasn’t. The Book Thief was a really unique way to tell a familiar story.<br/><br/>I think what made the story unique and special was the voice of the narrator. I really enjoyed the voice and ability the author had to show more by using the voice they did. Seeing the book thief Liesel through another person’s eyes added a level to the story that made it stand out. The narrator was definitely not a character I’ve run into in a lot of books but it fit for this book.<br/><br/>I also really liked Liesel. She was so young and had been through so much. She saw death and pain and hate. She was left and loved and disliked. She had so much against her yet she was strong and resilient. The things she went through were things no one should have to go through and yet Liesel kept going. She not only kept going but she stood up for herself and didn’t let anyone walk all over her. But she also knew when to keep quiet. She was a pretty special character and will stay with me for a while.<br/><br/>The reason I didn’t rate this higher was the fact that it was slow moving at times with a lot of pages. Don’t get me wrong, that isn’t a bad thing, it just made reading the book a little daunting. But I pushed through and I’m glad I did. The Book Thief broke my heart in a unique way but also left me feeling that everything happens for a reason both good and bad. So I say thank you again to my friend for making me get over my fear and to take this journey. What a book journey it was.
 This was a very interesting book with good characterization.  It is written from a character the author created which is "Death."  It is simply written and although I enjoyed it, the book was definitely written for young adults or adolescents.  It is about a girl growing up in Germany during the war.  She is not Jewish  and that is what is rather unique about this book.  It is written from the viewpoint of non-Jews who are also horrified and against what the Nazis were doing to the Jewish population.  It is good to remember that many, if not most people were horrified by what was happening.  Not all Germans were Jew haters.  Most probably were not.  The mystery of the time was how did Hitler get enough people to go along with his ridiculous black vision.  The answer is through tyranny and terrorizing the German people who had come from devastation to actually having a bit of food on the table.  Could it happen again; even in another country such as the US?  Yes.  Far too many people play "follow the leader" which is easier than thinking or fighting.  Its sad.  If people would ban together they could certainly change government.  But, alas, it never happens.
 My fourteen-year-old daughter just completed this book for school, and she wrote a lovely review. So I'll share it here for future readers - both of my daughters highly recommend this!<br/><br/>--------------------------------------<br/><br/>This Holocaust young adult novel  retains some adult elements, and yet stands out among many other books. This story has characters that readers connect with, which is a quality all good quality books should have. The Book Thief has the little facts correct, which many authors overlook. In addition, this novel tells a World War II story in a completely new way.<br/><br/>This story has a setting I have seen repeatedly, but with a unique twist. The Book Thief takes place in Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II in a small town called Molching on a street called Himmel (Heaven). The story may seem at first to be about Liesel, but ultimately Death and his relationships with humans become the focus of The Book Thief.<br/>The Book Thief tells the story of Liesel Meminger, her friend Rudy Steiner, a Jew named Max Vanderburg in Liesel’s basement, Liesel’s foster family, and Nazi Germany. Liesel’s brother dies on the train ride to their foster home with Hans and Rosa Hubermann, and she steals her first book, The Grave Digger’s Handbook, at his gravesite. Hans teaches her how to read and a love of books increases.<br/><br/>The Book Thief has a unique style of narration. Death does not often appear as a book narrator, and as such, he can be interpreted in many ways. Markus Zusak has chosen to depict Death as a tired “result” that gathers up all the dead souls, but has an attachment to some of the survivors. One of these survivors is Liesel, and Death picks her as the topic of his narration. This style combines first person and third person omniscient, since the narrator interacts with the story as a character, but he also sees all the thoughts of the other characters.<br/><br/>Rosa Hubermann speaks roughly, inserting the German word for pig into almost every sentence. Hans shows his love for his foster daughter and treats her as his own, playing his accordion for her. Rosa and Hans both have much importance and help shape Liesel’s character. Rudy Steiner becomes Liesel’s first friend. He almost becomes a love interest for Liesel, since he always wants her to kiss him. Max Vanderburg enters the life of the Hubermanns and Liesel because of a debt. Hans promised Max’s mom that he would try to help her family after Max’s dad, an army friend of Hans and Hans’ accordion teacher, dies at war. Max becomes another friend for Liesel, and he influences her life up to the end. Ilsa Hermann, the wife of the mayor of the town of Molching, cares for Liesel. She punishes herself for the death of her son by keeping her house cold and not reading any books, but she takes pity on the inaccessibility of books in Liesel’s life and lets Liesel read her books, even going so far as to let Liesel steal them. Max earns the spot as my favorite character, but Ilsa and Hans almost steal the spotlight.<br/>Death places color in the spotlights as one of the major themes of this novel. From “signature black” to “soupy red” to “whitecap clouds,” Death describes colors to distract himself from the survivors. These colors serve as his “vacation” since Death cannot take a day off.<br/><br/>One other major theme in The Book Thief permeates the book. The story of Liesel, her stolen books, her relationship with Rudy, her relationship with Mama and Papa, and her relationship with Max all point to one theme: the power of love. Liesel loves books, along with all of these people, and these loves influence  all of her decisions in this book.<br/>When I look for a new book, I consider many qualities important. I consider topic, length, ratings, and re-readability, among other items.  If someone asked me to give The Book Thief a star rating, I would give it five stars out of five. The Book Thief has all of these qualities, so I am proud to own a copy of my own.
 A friend recommended this book because she 'loved' it. I respect her literary judgement highly. By the time I got to the end, I was very interested in the outcome and the characters' paths. In fact, I liked the ending very much! But I had a tough time in the beginning as the writing seemed very disjointed, and more than once I contemplated quitting. But I persevered and was glad I did in the end. Reflecting back, the characters trials and tribulations provided a unique perspective of life in Germany during the Nazi regime of those who did not agree with Hitler's philosophy and terror tactics.
 Wow-what a piece of literature! One of the top ten books I've ever read!<br/>I was an English major and am a teacher. I read most of the young adult series (Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Divergent, etc.) The Book Thief is by far the best!<br/><br/>Reasons I like the book:<br/><br/>* The author's figurative language-parrticularly, his use of metaphors<br/>* His portrayal of the suffering of the Jews, even though many of them had been prominent members of German society, e.g., tailors, customers at Mr. Steiner's clothing store<br/>* Demonstrating the compassion of many of the Germans to the Jews-often at the risk of ridicule and punishment<br/>* Showing the dangers of groupthink, or blind allegiance to a leader<br/>* The power of books and words-for good or bad<br/><br/>The most powerful and moving scene (I say scene because I vividly imagined it as I was reading) was near the end when Liesel saw Max in the parade of Jews to Dachau. The words she spoke, repeating the opening sentence of the booklet he had written for her, the punishment she subjected herself to, his reaction to seeing her again-What beauty and agony at the same time! I reread that part several times since it was so moving.<br/><br/>I think all high schoolers and adults should read this book. Highest recommendation for everybody!<br/><br/>Now that I've finished the book, I plan on seeing the movie. I've heard it's very good.<br/><br/>Update: I watched the movie-it was disappointing compared to the book-so many things left out...
 I may be one of the few people who saw the movie before I read the book. This is rare for me, but I actually found myself preferring the movie version to this book.<br/><br/>The story itself revolves around a young girl named Liesel, who is living in Germany during WWII. When her mother can no longer afford to take care of her, she's given up to a foster family and starts a new life on Himmel Street. The book is narrated by death, who crosses her path more than once, and tells the story of her struggles as she grows from a child to a teenager.<br/><br/>The book is narrated by Death in the first person perspective. There's a lot of little blurbs of information dotted through the chapter, interrupting the flow of the narrative. I found the book to be pretty choppy as I was reading it. Also, if I hadn't already known what was coming, I would have been kind of mad that the narrator itself spoils a major part of the book before the reader gets there.<br/><br/>As I said before, I saw the movie before I read the book. While I enjoyed seeing some situations fleshed out better and more characters added, I preferred the straightforward way the movie went through the narrative versus the way it skipped around in the book. It's a pretty quick read and a decent story, but it's not one of my favorites. I'm glad that I read it, but I probably won't reread it in the future.
 What an unusual novel.  “The Book Thief” is so many things at the same time.  It can be profoundly sad, uplifting, touching and even brutal within just a few pages.  Throughout all, however, it is a wonderful read.<br/><br/>Markus Zusak’s book is ostensibly aimed at young adult readers.  But, it is really a book that is open to all.  To call it a book for young adults is to do it a disservice.  It is far more than just this.<br/><br/>The novel tells the story of Leisel Meminger, a young girl given up to foster parents by her mother.  The setting is Nazi Germany in the Second World War where Leisel often goes without.  The family is also under pressure for harbouring a Jewish refugee is their basement.  The family may be poor but they are truly honourable.<br/><br/>Yet, perhaps the book’s most unusual feature it that the narrator is Death.  He is an all pervasive and all seeing presence throughout the story.  This is certainly an unusual approach for a writer but it also certainly works.  The book flows at a fast pace.  It is a genuine page turner but I will reveal no more of the story.  It would be best to undertake the book for yourself.<br/><br/>I recommend “The Book Thief” to all readers without hesitation.  It is a work of great character by a young writer.  I found myself swept along by the story and almost in tears at the last page.  Few books have such an impact on this phlegmatic reviewer.
 I was at dinner with my family when my stepmom brought up this book and, more specifically, how it is a now also a movie and that my twin 13 year old sisters want to see the movie. She said that she wanted them to read the book first. Based on our discussion of the basic premise of the book I came home and bought it and read it.<br/>Narrated by Death, the book seems far from the movie production (I watched only the preview for the movie once I had finished the book). Death follows our heroine through most of her life and he is also attending to the dead.<br/>Zusak creates a convincing portrait of Nazi Germany, and also manages to create sympathy for Death.<br/>Death talks about the different places WWII calls him to, the beaches at Normandy, and, most memorable for me, the bombing of Cologne where Death says "Five hundred souls. I carried them in my fingers, like suitcases. Or I'd throw them over my shoulder. It was only the children I carried in my arms."<br/>An infinitely moving and hopeful book.<br/>As for my 13 year old sisters? I'd let them see the PG - 13 movie, but the book is much darker and more true territory,
 This story is told like a poem, like a painting. A fast moving storyline you will not find here. Every little snippet of the story comes together to paint a picture of the soul of these characters. There are much insights into the nature of humanity, the power of words. Out of so much sorrow and destruction, it is not hatred and despair you will find, but love and hope. It is hard to finish the story with dry eyes, but they will not only be tears of sadness. It will be the enormous beauty of love that arouses your emotion. I know this story will stay me. The characters will live in my heart. I will revisit them for years to come.
 SPOILERS<br/><br/>I enjoyed this book immensely and would highly recommend it.  I know it is listed as Young Adult, but it is also good for parents to read with their children.<br/><br/>The narrator/character of Death talks about the job of taking souls away.  Each soul is different and greets the narrator as such.  All this is in the backdrop of Nazi Germany; where Death states he/she serves the Furher very well.  I love how democratic Death is in the taking away process, whether it be on Himmel Strasse, a concentration camp or Stalingrad.<br/><br/>Liesel Meminger is the common German person who lives as a foster child.  She learns the power of reading and words through the ability to read.  Words can do good things, but they can also be harmful.  She becomes the book thief various times in her life, despite not being able to read in the beginning.  Each book represents growing and learning from the texts she owns; they are her prize possessions.<br/><br/>I like the fact we say good and bad Germans, not everyone was a card carrying Nazi.  Some were just trying to survive, feed their families and make it to the end of the war.  Others behave meanly and showed their prejudices.  We are introduced to Max, a Jew just trying to get to a hiding place and escape Nazi persecution.<br/><br/>Some pivotal scenes in the text:<br/>The last march to Dachau<br/>Joining the Hitler Youth<br/>Allied bombing raids over Germany<br/>A Nazi soldier hiding a Jew and moving him to safety
 The Book Thief is a tremendous novel. I read this book several years ago and purchased a new copy to gift my daughter. I think everyone would enjoy this read. It is written exceptionally and is a high quality read.
 I was ambivalent about this book regardless of the positive reviews; however, I went ahead and placed a hold on it at my local library.<br/><br/>When I started reading 'The Book Thief' I felt a bit perplexed and felt maybe this book wasn't for me.  After the first few pages I decided to put the book away and pick up the reading the following day.  Instead of the following day, I continued a few hours later.  I am glad I decided to continue reading and not return the book, because, `The Book Thief' is now one of my favorite books.  And I have bought it to add to my collection.<br/><br/>I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer so I had to ponder a few times what the writer was trying to relay.  In other words, the book will make you stop to think - it's not one of those books where `red' means `red'.  You will find lots of similes and metaphors throughout the book.<br/><br/>The story of Liesel's life is beyond captivating and the writer made me feel as though I was actually there during her highs and lows.  Liesel is charming, funny, witty and a young girl who's been through loss and abandonment but somehow managed to get beyond her early struggles.<br/><br/>The characters are all alive, with their own peculiar personalities; their different stories of life to tell.  The characters are almost palpable and not one of them can be called boring.<br/><br/>The story of Liesel's life is narrated by Death - yes, `death', as in, the Grim Reaper.  You'll find Death to be quite a comic, likable and almost human.  With a very busy work schedule.<br/><br/>This book brings out various emotions and quite frankly, I cried when I read some aspects of the book.  It was a very emotional read, some people may say depressing.  However, it was worth reading.
 Oy. This book. This book! I can't even. It's a book I've been meaning to read for years. I'd actually started it a number of times. I guess the timing was never quite right. I'd either pick something else up or I'd have to return the audiobook to the library. It wasn't that I didn't like it. I was just never so caught up I couldn't put it down. That all changed when I read it for book club this month. I re-listened to the first part of the book while making book club snacks and cleaning around the house. Soon I found myself stopping what I was doing and just listening. I then curled up on my couch to read the physical book because I couldn't wait to find out how everything played out. In the end I was sitting up on the couch, crouched over, sobbing over the events of the story.<br/><br/>As I said, I felt shattered. I mean, the narrator tells you what's going to happen way in advance but it still snuck up on me. I just couldn't distance myself from the characters. The scenes at the end of the book (trying not to get specific here!) were so powerful and evocative. I cried while re-reading the places I'd highlighted to make favors for book club. I cried while talking about the book at book club. I cried while reading excerpts aloud. Basically there was a lot of tearing up going on.<br/><br/>I know immediately after finishing I said I'd never re-read The Book Thief and put myself through that again. I'm still an emotional wreck when I think about it (how am I going to survive the movie?!?!?!) But I may have changed my mind. The book was just so incredibly beautiful. By missing out on the hard parts I'd deprive myself of too much good as well.<br/><br/>Audiobook Note: I really loved the narration on this one. Truly a fabulous audiobook that added much to the story. Also, I can now pronounce "saumensch" and "saukerl" which is a skill I value.
 Okay, looking at this book's literary merit with as objective an eye as possible, I will say it's a well written novel with a unique point of view. For that alone, I would give it four stars. Zusak certainly delivers some beautiful moments and some heartbreaking ones, and his characters are appropriately developed. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get that invested. I wanted to love this book and I know so many people who do, but I didn't get there. I wish I could give a concrete reason for why that is, but I guess some books grab you and others don't and that's all there is to it.
 The Book Thief gets added to my list of favorite books. I read it and marveled at where it took me, emotionally and in my thoughts. I thought I understood living in a war as well as someone who hasn't actually been in one could. I was so wrong, and though I certainly don't have the experience to say it, I think former warriors may find themselves saying something of the same.<br/><br/>The setting is what lets this happen. It's not placed on a battlefield. It's not told from the point of view of spies or rich businesspeople or even Jews or concentration camp survivors, though a hidden Jew is a part of the painting. The placement is within poor and desperately poor people living together, trying their best to be good Germans. And there are so many ways to do that in World War II Germany. We, now, see that war as headlines and photographs. These Germans lived there. They either voted for Hitler or not, and had to live with consequences that had so much and so little to do with their vote. They owned shops, made mistakes, joined friends, tried to work and eat. Sometimes the world came crashingly to them, and this is described with care but not rote obviousness. The Russian front is a place where you go to die or from which you are required to come home, having left the bodies, but not the souls, of those dead behind. Bombs are a mistake, errors that catalyze so many deaths of body and soul.<br/><br/>The narrator is a philosophical, bemused, caring and gentle Death, who tells this young girl's story with kindhearted and wistful words. The author uses that narrator's ephemeral nature to allow himself a generous number of smoothly ephemeral turns of phrase, relating many hard, cold, ordinary, or humanly painful events to the reader so that I often felt like not an observer, but the air curling around the event, barely touching anything around except to draw warmth and even beauty from it. Even the most intimately painful childhood hurts and dire Nazi atrocities felt not so much repulsive as understandable, pain softened to sorrow. Not forgiven, only viewed from a distance that was close enough to understand and know and collect the personal sufferings and small joys, but far enough away to be able to let the citizens of Himmelstrasse live their fates without interference from me.<br/><br/>I'll read this again. Thank you, Mr. Zusak.
 At first I found myself not reading this one.  I wasn't certain what was really going on at the beginning.  I would read a bit and stop.  I kept returning after several days but stop again.  I am an avid reader of historical work.  My first review was not positive.  But then I wrote the update review which I am including.  It will possibly help you with your initial reaction to the book.<br/><br/>But do NOT give up on the book.  My 2nd update I wrote when I had finished the book.  I TOTALLY recommend this book.  It is an important look into not just WWII Germany but into the world where we spend our lives now.  We had become to complacent about potential "Hitlers" leading up to 9/11.<br/><br/>UPDATE 1<br/>It is still a slow read for me...but it grabs you and  my mind has changed.  It is written differently but you become taken into the world of the girl and her foster parents as she struggles to learn to read but more than that...the way events around them controlled them.  You get the FULL flavor of the fear, the uncertainty, and the evil that controlled people just wanting to live their lives.<br/><br/>Update 2:  I finished the book.<br/>Because I stretched reading this book out over a long period of time, nothing was missed.  I became entwined in the story in a much different way than other well done books.  It almost was as if I wanted to prolong the experience,  As if I dreaded the ending and didn't want to reach it.  I knew these people...their strengths, their lives, their fears.  I watched as they were uncontrollably dragged along a path to the inevitable.  But the end of the book was reached and the final brief conclusion was stark but honest.<br/><br/>Even more it shows the events our country and the workd faces on a daily basis...is no different than what Liesel and her family and friends faced.  Evil still exists...the potential for it to control our lives is now and will always be a threat to the Liesels of our world.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most significant thing was how people living in Germany still attempted to find normalcy in a time that was far from normal.<br/><br/>You must read this book.
 The Book Thief  was  written in a very new  lliterary format but  settled down into a  great story that I could not put down.  It was the best novel I have read that looks at Nazi Germany in an intimate way, from the viewpoint of those opposed to Hitler and who felt sympathy for the Jews.<br/>I had followed that , somewhat , reading Dietrich Bonhoeffer , the theologian  who attempted , with others , to kill Hitler.  This was the best novel I have read that looks at a different Germany.  It also  presented a look at the rise of Hitler and why he rose so quickly with the power he had.<br/>The  story of the young girl and her adopted family and friends  was a powerful one.<br/>I look forward to reading more books by Zusak.
 Yes, five stars for the sheer heart-wrenching poetry of The Book Thief. I have read my share of books exposing the hell of a war maniacally inventioned by one Adolf Hitler. Markus Zusak broke my heart, yet in a beautiful way as he offers the young Leisel and her life to us. Books and words are sometimes enough. When all turns to fire and ash, the words remain. There are emotional layers to The Book Thief and revelations that make breathing difficult. Hans and Rosa, Rudy, Max, the mayor's wife and other delightful characters become your own friends. The injustices heaped upon Jews and struggling citizens are affirmed in history. You become one of the intimate family and townspeople who shape Leisel's world. The lesson is to not to ever forget...not then and not now.<br/><br/>Even Death, the master thief, does not relish his task. Emily Dickinson penned it well, "Because I could not stop for death...he kindly stopped for me." Death observes everything. It is as much his woe to tell as the people in this book. It seemed a logical choice as narrator. I found this refreshing and interesting. How poignant that Death was gentle to the collected souls while the cruelty of the Nazis raged.<br/><br/>I would suggest that readers learn about Operation Blumenpflucken, "Operation Flower-Picking", a Nazi euphemism used to label yet another of their concerted efforts to execute targeted individuals. My uncle's father, Sigurd Roll, was murdered in this Nazi scheme for his participation in a plan to rescue Norwegians. Markus Zusak deftly touches on similar horrors without the gore. His characters are tragic and yet resilient. There is nothing superficial or shallow about them. If you allow yourself to be drawn in, you will see the subtle bruising of their hearts. You cannot criticize the choices they make while remaining resolute to overcome difficulty and suffering. Atrocities arrive bit by bit to numb the senses, but humanity learns to be watchful and sleep less.
 I read this book primarily because it turned up as one of the choices on my son's summer reading list and I wanted to see if he'd like it. I knew of the book already, of course, because it had been mentioned in the media a lot and I'd heard it was good.<br/><br/>The format of the story took a little getting used to (Death as a narrator and the "poetry"-like language used), but once I did get used to that after the first chapter or so, I became enthralled in the story and grew to love the inventive use of language throughout. The plot itself is very engrossing, the characters are interesting and overall it's just a unique book. I found it humorous and emotional throughout. Much better than the movie (which I watched a short time after finishing the book).<br/><br/>Although the movie pretty much stayed faithful to the plot of the book, I felt it lacked the emotional complexity, especially the fear aspect. I didn't feel "tense" watching the movie or think at any moment these people could be taken away for the slightest offense, but reading the book I did. That fear was much more palpable between these pages than on the movie screen.<br/><br/>The stakes each character faced were illustrated better in the book and you got a lot more of the history, which I think is important if children are reading it, because they won't have an adult's knowledge of events from that time period to draw on for context. The movie's not bad (if you're already familiar with events of WWII), but you should read the book first to get the most out of the story.
 This is now my most favorite book. I love how the author uses words to describe the surroundings, scenery, emotions with just a few profound words, like poetry, when it takes pages for other authors to say the same thing. I did not see the movie, and I probably won't either. I can't believe that a movie could ever be as good as this book.  What an adventure for a child so young. To have been loved by strangers when her world has been taken from her. Death has always been a chilling character, but this one has a circle for a heart. He admired this girl and how she adapted to everything - that which is bad, is also good in her life. I'm glad I bought this book instead of borrowing it from the Kindle Library. I will go back and reread this book.  I enjoyed my time with all of these characters and was sad when the story came to an end.
 The Book Thief by Markus Zusak follows the life of a girl named Liesel Meminger in Germany during World War II.  Liesel’s story starts rolling on the train ride to the town of Molching, where the majority of the story plays out, when her little brother died.  The majority of the story encompasses Liesel’s journey in Molching with her foster parents, the Hubermanns, where she learns to read, builds connections, steals books (as implied by the title), and lives through the struggles of war.  Liesel and the other people in her town had to cope with a risky food supply, as there was rationing and hunger.  Liesel’s best friend was “permanently hungry.”  Liesel and her foster parents also hide a Jewish man named Max in their basement for a share of the story.<br/>  The author tells the story as the persona of death, and the audience appears to be people that could only have an outside view on Germany, as the novel is an eye opener to the lives of people in Nazi Germany.  Zusak brings a more human lense to the people in Germany, and demonstrates that they struggled in the war.  The Book Thief brings people with identities and personalities to Nazi Germany, and shows their emotions and acts of kindness.  Friendships are shown, such as that of Liesel and Rudy.  Rudy "was there for her at the beginning, and  was there] later on, when Liesel's frustration boiled over."  Zusak's canvas also displays parent-child bonds that the characters possess (especially Liesel's bond with her papa).  The characters face the hardships of death in bombings and combat, suicide, loss of family members, hunger, and separation from family.  Zusak also helps outsiders to separate the German citizens from Hitler.  The novel brings out sadness in readers when disaster strikes or the characters hurt, and warmth when the characters embrace their connections to each other.<br/>  The structure was quite unique.  There were sections of text separated from the rest that had their own headings, and the narrator bounced back and forth a bit along the timeline.  There is also several parts long, with the dividing pages being originally formatted.  There were also chapters labeled as part one, with the part twos not following them consecutively.  Overall, Zusak’s novel was very well written.  It unveiled a new perspective, was never boring, and was emotionally touching.  The characters were great (I was easily able to develop attachments to them).  Personally, The Book Thief has changed my perspective on the Germans in World War II, and it moved me to tears.
 This was one of the best books I've read the last couple of years. I love it when people come up with original ideas in fiction. When I first started reading this, and it became obvious that Death was the narrator, my reaction was kind of 'ooh' and I wasn't sure about how I felt about that. But as the story went on, using Death as the narrator was a very clever way to tell about The Book Thief and her family and friends. The thief, Liesl, is a girl in WWII Germany who is taken by her mother who cannot keep her, to live with foster parents. She sees her brother die, and that tragic occurence really occupies her nightmares. For some reason at the same time of her brother's death and her mother's abandonment, she finds and steals a book which she takes with her to her foster parents. Her foster father took this odd book that she found (about grave digging) to read to her when she woke up from the nightmares. As time goes on, Liesl would continue 'steal' books from various places...the street, the mayor's house. She's alway looking for a book to fill her need for words. When her foster family takes in a Jewish man to hide during the beginning of WWII, she finds books to read not just to herself, but to him as well...to make his world broader than the confines of her basement.<br/><br/>Death observes her and her family and friends. He is fascinated by what she is doing in her life, in understanding why she does these things...and his point of view is different and more encompassing her experiences in the whole of what is happening in Germany.<br/><br/>The writing of this book is exquisite. So many beautiful lines in the book. It's so rare to find such a well-written book that you cherish the words as you go through them. I bought this for my Kindle, but I wish I had gotten a book instead so that I could give it to others, like my husband and granddaughter to read.<br/><br/>Part of the reason I love this book, is as a Deaf girl growing up in a hearing family, I took refuge in books...which I would read in and under trees, late at night when my father would find me under the covers with a flashlight...and he would demand that I go to bed. My books were my company, my friends, and let me know more about the world that I could not deal with. I totally understand Liesl's motivation...and I think back then, I would have been a book thief as well.
 The Book Thief follows Liesel Meminger, as she grows up in World War II Germany. Death will meet Liesel three different times throughout the course of her life. Liesel is put into foster care after being separated from her communist parents. She grows up in the Hubermann house, and at first she struggles to adjust, but she finds her pace, and makes a few friends, including the neighbor boy Rudy. Rudy seems to be a symbol of her childhood. He seemingly embodies childlike innocence, and mischief. Then comes Max. Max is a Jewish teen boy, who escapes a concentration camp, and comes to hide in the Hubermann’s basement. Liesel and Max have this friendship, where she helps him feel young, and he helps her to grow up a little. Part of their friendship is based on a love of books and words. Just as it seems that Liesel is starting to grow up a little and come into her own, her whole life is changed in one night, in the blink of an eye.<br/>This book has such interesting prose. It’s not quite adult like, but it’s not child-like either. It’s like Liesel in that sense. She seems to be stuck between being a child and trying to grow up in a time that isn’t child friendly. The interesting prose is a strength of this book. The book is quite character heavy, and sometimes it’s easy to get a little confused as to who’s doing what with whom. The intersecting storylines have a tendency to make you question where the author is going, but if you keep along on the ride, you’ll find a heart wrenching, but incredibly well written story. It teaches you valuable lessons about friendships, different concepts of love and youth. A very sad, but enjoyable tale.
 A book narrated by Death himself is certainly a step out of the ordinary.  The Book Thief is aimed at middle schoolers, and I bought it as a read for my daughter but was intrigued to read  it first myself to see how intense or upsetting it might be.  The examples of life, death, misery and persecution in suburban Munich are vivid and believable enough to make even a cynical tween pause and think.  Kids who "get into the head" of the characters in the books they read may be a bit troubled by this story, but those who can empathize with a character and possess enough maturity to separate themselves from the character will get a very good understanding of what things must have been like in those times.  My mother lived in Germany as a child of much the same age as the main character during this exact time period, and the experiences that she has described to me rang very true upon reading The Book Thief.  The author did his research well from what I can tell.  The plot is engaging enough to keep the reader coming back for chapter after chapter and Death's occasional commentaries do a nice job of breaking up what might otherwise become too intense.<br/><br/>Bottom line - a good book for a thoughtful tween or young teen and an interesting read for anyone with an interest in or connection to to the times and events portrayed.
 I have not written a book review before but I felt compelled to do so after reading The Book Thief.  I was looking to read an interesting story after reading many crime books and thrillers and I could not have made a better choice.  I will not give you another synopsis as many readers before me have already done this  but I will tell you that you will love this story about a young girl called Liesel who was brought up by her stepparents in war torn Germany.  You will laugh with her, dream with her and as her story ends I can tell you that your heart will go out to her and you will cry with her.<br/>A special mention must also be made to our narrator, you will not have met him but you will know his name.  As the story progresses you will find it comforting that even He has a heart and soul. The introduction of this narrator as the story teller is a masterstroke by Zusak.<br/>Some readers have said that this book is too long but I wanted it to go on, I wanted to read more about Liesel.  A must read for all ages and genders.
 I’m in that strange period of time right now, having just finished The Book Thief, feeling both exhausted and hopeful.  I feel just like the soul collector who, after rescuing Liesel Meminger’s story, wants to know “how the same thing could be so ugly and so glorious, and its words and stories so damning and brilliant.”<br/><br/>The Book Thief is a truly original and moving story of a young Liesel Meminger, whose mother, at the outset of World War II, gives up her daughter to a foster family outside Munich, Germany.  Stunned, Liesel suffers this loss and slowly, in the smallest of steps, rises to periods of love and happiness, through a foster love that is initially unrecognizable, but deep, through her neighbor friend Rudy Steiner, through words and books, and through a painfully happy connection with Max Vandenburg, a German Jew who is hiding in her family’s basement.<br/><br/>It’s the relationships in this story that give you hope.  It’s how they build and become something you know is stronger than the hatred and the loss.  These are the things that help you make sense of a time when one man used words to almost destroy an entire population of innocent people.<br/><br/>I don’t know what to say that properly presents The Book Thief to you.  If you’re a high school student and this book is on your reading list, pick it, even if the title doesn’t grab you.  If you are like me and are just getting to this book, nearly nine years since it was published, read it before the others on your stack.  If you are tempted to see the movie first, read the book first.  I have not seen the movie yet, but the books are always better first.  We all know that.<br/><br/>I will tell you what I like so much about The Book Thief, besides the way the author has made me feel both so happy and sad at the very same time.<br/><br/>1) The relationship between Liesel and Hans Hubermann is like no other.<br/>2) The relationship between Liesel and Max Vandenburg is like no other.<br/>3) The relationship between Liesel and Rudy Steiner is like no other.<br/><br/>You get the idea.<br/><br/>This book is like no other.
 Firstly I'll get my negative comment out of the way!  If you want a fast paced novel with lots happening then this book won't give you that.  However on a positive note it is well worth sticking with it.  Many books have been written about war, and this one deals with Word War Two.  However it deals with the subject from the perspective of a few families in a fictitious town near Munich detailing their daily, often mundane, lives.  No big events are mentioned much in the book, but it gives an insight into the personal tragedy of war and how it affects just these few families.  Basically it puts names (albeit fictitious ones) and a very human face onto the statistics of war.  So often we read of hundreds of victims, thousands killed in a bombing raid and so on, but this book makes it personal.<br/>I also loved how it was narrated, but I won't spoil it by naming the narrator.<br/>I would highly recommend this book.<br/>Tony W
 We've read the stories of the holocaust before, the terrors brought to Germany and the rest of Europe by Hitler, the horrific plight of the Jews during World War II.  This is not a new story.  Think a reverse Anne Frank without the naivete.  But you've never read it like this.<br/><br/>Markus Zusak uses the point of view of Death to tell the heartbreaking story of Liesel Meminger, a nine-year-old soon-to-be orphan at the beginning of the book.  Death is intrigued by Liesel and follows her throughout her daily tasks for the five years during the war.<br/><br/>Because of a promise made during another war, Liesel's foster parents take in a young Jewish man, hiding him in their basement.  The young man and Liesel become friends by sharing words.<br/><br/>This is a story of words: how they are used for creation and destruction, stolen and given, how they bring life to some and death to others.  Markus Zusak cradles and loves every word he writes, just as Death cradles the souls he collects.  The Book Thief brought me to tears more than once, not just because of my empathy and support of Liesel and her loved ones, but because of the sheer beauty of those words.  There were several times that I had to stop reading, go back and reread a sentence slowly just to let it dance in color and brilliance between my eyes for a minute.<br/>The description of Death was chilling - not terrifying, mind you, but chilling.  He was a likeable, realistic, empathetic, and surprisingly nurturing character who has a love / hate relationship with his job.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend The Book Thief to anyone.  Its descriptions of this terrible war are realistic and historically accurate without being gory, the story is a wonderful page-turner, the characters were believable and lovable, and the writing is superb.  It is one of the best books I've ever read.
 Books come to us in many different ways. Sometimes a favorite author gifts us with something new. Other times a friend recommends a book. At times a buzz surrounds a book and we jump in the fray to see what it’s all about. The best books are the ones we stumble upon, they appeal to us on a personal level and regardless of the hype, or lack thereof, we are drawn to its pages. The latter is how I came to read The Book Thief.<br/><br/>Stories about people enduring hardship appeal to me because they prove humans are resilient. There are times when I think resilience abandoned me and the reminder that others have survived far worse than what I experience puts me back on track.<br/><br/>With Death as a narrator, we learn about Liesel. She’s extraordinary on so many levels, the epitome of resilience, a witness to history. While death collects souls, Leisel steals books. Though a war ravages the world around her, this young girl finds joy in the simplest of things: books, friends, an accordion and a Jewish man that hides in her foster parents’ basement. The unfairness of life keeps pushing her down, but she won’t stay. Her spirit is strong. So strong, that Death comes to admire her.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is one of those books that can only be described as beautiful, even though the subject matter is dark and harsh. Markus Zusak tells a story of colors, mixing stains of fear with shades of joy. The characters are so real and believable one might think Zusak knew them personally, maybe even walked in their shoes.<br/><br/>Though Death sometimes reveals things out of order, it doesn’t take away from the telling of the story. I truly enjoyed this book and recommend it to everyone.
 I had avoided reading this for a very long time when I heard that Death was the narrator. Seemed like there were a few too many books out already, narrated by an entity from the other side. Was it becoming a gimmick? When the movie came out, my interest was piqued and I decided to give it a try. Am I ever glad I did.<br/><br/>Here is a main character who pulls the reader through the book while facing obstacle after obstacle. Here are other well-drawn characters, a distinct setting, a compelling time in history, a narration device that works, and a logical ending-all the components of a finely written book. This is World War II, but this is not the battlefield, not the holocaust. This is the story of a little girl who enters a foster home where she befriends the Jew hidden in their basement, loves her foster father, endures her foster mother, and bonds with a boy from the neighborhood. Death is always nearby, growing weary from his job of collecting the mounting number of souls resulting from the war.<br/><br/>This is a story not only of survival, but also of retaining some sense of humanity in a world that seems to have lost its way. You won't soon forget this book.
 This is the first novel I've ever read that's been narrated by Death, yet Death is unlike you'd expect. First of all, Death has feelings, conflicting feelings for the human race, that Death finds difficult to understand. Although how could you blame such an entity that has to "work" through the Second World War. After seeing so much pain and suffering during the war,  you might expect Death not to have any feelings at all for human beings. However, Liesel Meminger and her urge to steal books and her devotion to those closest to her, grabs Death's attention the moment he first sees her. She gives him hope. A hope that not that encourages Death to look on the bright side, but also the reader.<br/><br/>Being that the Second World War is one of the darkest times in human history, it's hard to believe that this novel isn't full of sorrow. To the contrary, it consists of lighthearted humour and raw, playful characters that help not only the reader get through the terrible reality of the war, but also Death. This book is for anyone who appreciates a well-written novel with unforgettable characters, and the ability to make the reader feel an immense range of emotions.
 How do you plan on meeting Death? With a fire burning in your eyes? Meekly, like a lost child? Did you plan to give him a punch in the eye?<br/><br/>Markus Zusak takes us on a journey with an unlikely storyteller - Death. Not your skeletal faced, scythe-wielding Death either, in fact, in his own words:<br/><br/>"A SMALL PIECE OF TRUTH<br/>I do not carry a sickle or scythe.<br/>I only wear a hooded black robe when it's cold.<br/>And I don't have those skull-like facial features you seem to enjoy pinning on me from a distance. You want to know what I truly look like? I'll help you out. Find yourself a mirror while I continue."<br/><br/>I'd never read a story like this before, and chances are, I won't again. I'd heard a lot of very positive things, which quite possibly gave it a bit of a disadvantage, if I'd not been pre-warned the story may have been more emotional, more exciting, just MORE. Sadly, because of this pre-warning, I went into it with my eyes open, hoping, no, expecting to be impressed and blown away with the story.  I was... but not as much as I had hoped.<br/><br/>Leisel, henceforth referred to as The Book Thief, failed to worm her way into my heart and set up shop there completely. I felt connected to her; I mean she loved books and words... I wouldn't be writing this, nor read the book if I too didn't share that passion, but I think this is where the connection ended. That is not to say that Markus' writing style left me wanting in the emotional stakes... oh no! I will share more with you shortly.<br/><br/>If at first you feel a little distanced from the characters, or indeed the entire story as I found myself, persevere! I think the issue is the 'outside looking in' feel you get from the re-telling style of narration. This is something you must grow accustomed to slowly, immersing yourself, ever so slowly into the frigid waters that are Death's musings and memories.<br/><br/>By half way through the book, the distance I felt had dissipated. I was bound to this book. Tethered so completely I felt like sleeping with my kindle. The story began to haunt my dreams and pervade my mind while I was awake. I saw flecks of Leisel, Hans, Rosa and Rudy in people of my everyday life. A familiar silver eye; a cardboard-faced, wardrobe-shaped woman; a small girl darting through a crowd. I knew then, that this book would be a problem.<br/><br/>I'd been pre-warned about the ending... nothing specific mind you, but it was enough. Really this book shouldn't need a warning, the story is about the holocaust, we all know how that ended, but rather surprisingly it still did. It was a very apt warning too, and as it turns out, I needed it.<br/><br/>At 11:30pm on October 18th 2012 I lay in bed with tears streaking down my face and a guttural sadness gripping my heart as I switched off my kindle. I felt as if my best friend had died. That's horrible isn't it! But it doesn't change the fact that it's the truth.<br/><br/>Be prepared people, be warned! This book may do more than just steal a few hours/days/weeks of your life. It may also implant a strong sense of sadness and loss at the end. Be prepared to be awed, to be inspired and then thoroughly gutted. Markus has a truly poetic writing style that so completely shows you, not only what is happening, but also the fullness of the emotions and feelings involved.<br/><br/>Be prepared for an emotional raping with this book!<br/><br/>Be prepared to find out:  "Even death has a heart."
 I am a very latecomer to the party, but I finally read The Book Thief and am so glad I did.  I purchased this book in 2010, after many friends told me I should.  I started to read it back then and remember that it just didn't click with me.  The voice of the narrator (which I won't tell you who it is) was just "off" to me.  It didn't sit well.  I wasn't interested.  So I put it down.<br/><br/>In 2014, I picked it up again.  I don't know if I was in a different place or just ready to read it.  This time, from the first page, the narrator was haunting and wonderful to me.  The words were beautiful prose.  The story was compelling.  Now, that's not to say I breezed through the book quickly; it actually took me a long time to read, but it was the eloquent beauty of the words that kept me intrigued and kept me coming back.  It wasn't a story I wanted to rush- it was something I wanted to savor.<br/><br/>The story of Liesel and Himmel street is one of immense sorrow, angst, agony, confusion, and ultimately of the human spirit.  I found Liesel to be a compelling young lady, her friends (and enemies) all so real, and the narrator so interesting.  I loved the spin on the story, the tales of hardship, and the stories of love in various forms- from a harsh stepmother, to a doting stepfather, the crazy boy next door, an angry and broken neighbor, the man in the basement, and even the narrator himself.  I didn't really expect to cry in the end, but I did.  This book was so worth the read and I highly recommend it to anyone that hasn't read it yet.  Again, I'm late to the party, but glad I finally came.
 Markus Suzak has turned out a masterpiece in this story of an orphaned girl, Liesel, whose foster parents do not fit the mold of their antisemitic, Nazified town. The girl's challenges -- the loss of her real parents and her younger brother, her accustoming herself to a new mother who can be off-the-charts loony, a town that will not brook variations from its norms, and her own battle to teach herself to read and write -- make for a page turner. It is not without hope: her relationship with her new "Papa," a man who teaches by example love of one's fellow (even one who is hunted down for being Jewish) is a vital component of the book. The sympatico between Liesel and one of the downtrodden is meaningful and poignant, and even Death becomes a sympathetic character, quite an accomplishment given his job.<br/><br/>Written in the first person from the viewpoint of the Angel of Death, this book is so well-written I ended up with over a hundred underlined passages. There's hardly a page on which either a whole exerpt or a turn of wrenching phrase does not capture the reader.<br/><br/>I'd say that the theme may be a little adult-like for a Young Adult audience, but I may be behind the times. In any case, The Book Thief is unforgettable, and, of the 100+ Young Adult novels I've read in the past six or eight months, head and shoulders above the rest.
 This book is so beautifully written; I finished it several weeks ago and I am still ruminating on it.  The beginning was a bit chaotic for me but still kept me interested enough to read on.  Once I figured out the narrator and the introduction of each chapter; I was mesmerized.  I never feel the need to re-hash the synopsis of the book so I won't do that here either.  The book is a must read.  It shows a different perspective on Nazi Germany during WWII.  It shows humanity and true courage and love; so much love manifested in so many different ways.  The themes of the novel while important are almost overshadowed by the beauty of the writing.  The book is like a poem, the words flow so well together. I found myself reading it out loud.  I read on a Kindle and I have never highlighted as many passages as I did from this book. I loved it, every moment of it.  I downloaded the enhanced version with movie clips embedded in the book.  The clips did not add much for me just because the written word was powerful enough that the images they created satisfied me fully.
 "The Book Thief" is a long tale set in Germany during World War II.  The main character and the book thief of the title is a feisty young schoolgirl named Liesel Meminger.  Her young brother dies at the start of the book.  She takes her first book shortly after her younger brother's death.  Her mother disappears, and Liesel is left in the care of a foster family in the town of Molching, Germany.  Liesel is nearly illiterate at the beginning.  Under the tutelage of her foster father, she learns how to read the first book she took. So begins her passion of words and books.  She develops a close friendship with a young boy named Rudy Steiner, who is obsessed with the black athlete Jesse Owens.  A major turning point in the book occurs when her foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, hide a young Jew named Max, a man whose father once saved Hans's life.  Max writes a book for Liesel by writing on the pages of Hitler's "Mein Kampf," the pages of which he had made blank by painting them white.  A deep connection is forged between Liesel and Max.<br/><br/>One of the most unique features of the book is the use of Death as the book's rather compassionate narrator.  Throughout the book, Death makes interesting side comments in boldface type.  By allowing Death to narrate the story, Zusak brings a haunting quality to his story.  When speaking of human nature, Death comments, "So much good, so much evil.  Just add water."<br/><br/>The Book Thief has received many awards from around the world and has been translated into many languages.  The author is applauded for his daring.  Book reviewers rave about the book.  There are a number of reasons for this.  It celebrates the power of words.  We get to see the rule of the Nazis from a unique point of view.  This is clearly an important piece of work, and it's a story that will keep you interested until the very end.  The characters are memorable.  Young Liesel is a character you will long remember.  One professional reviewer described the writing as "elegant, philosophical and moving."  In the end, it was the prose that I felt was not what I would have liked.  Other recent books with memorable young characters ("The Kite Runner" and "Peace Like a River") had much better prose in my opinion.  I would have liked to give this book four and a half stars; but that's not possible.  So I gave it four stars because I saw the book as less wonderful than the vast majority of readers.
 I was surprised to learn that this book was first published in 2006.  Either I have been living under a rock or this book has picked up some steam over the years because I only recently heard about this one.<br/><br/>This book is quite good without being loud.  It doesn't have a plot full of thrills and it doesn't really have any major twists or turns.  What it does have is believable characters that make you really care about them despite being rather ordinary people.  It also has a setting that you can connect with during a time that you will want to understand.  Set in World War II, the book is about a young girl, Liesel, who must go live with a foster family in rural Germany.<br/><br/>Her mother is soon presumed dead and Liesel struggles to connect with foster parents, her schoolmates, and her new community.  This book reminded me very much of To Kill a Mockingbird as we come to understand social injustices through the eyes of a young child and the actions of her brave father (in this case, her foster father).<br/><br/>This book does have one gimmick, which I didn't like at all at first, but later came to love.  The book is narrated by Death.  Death visited Germany often during World War II to pick up the bodies of the fallen and consequently, Death can easily comment on the goings on in Germany during those days.<br/><br/>But at the heart of the book is a vulnerable young girl who loves books, her foster father, and the boy next door.
 The Book Thief is the story of a young German girl who is adopted by an impoverished German family shortly before WW2, during the advent of the Nazi regime; the story proceeds from Hitler’s rise to power through WW2. The story’s perspective is that of this family and their neighbors as they cope with the increasing complexities of the Nazi regime and WW2. Interestingly, The Book Thief is narrated by Death, who takes on human characteristics, is a keen observer of human idiosyncrasies, and provides brief commentary on the events of WW2 as they impact his work of collecting souls. However, the book itself is not a war narrative, but rather a look at everyday life as conditions change as a result of Fascism and the war: how families attempt to adjust to implied and overt pressures from an increasingly totalitarian society, how they struggle to fit in and cope on a daily basis with neighbors and acquaintances who are becoming increasingly assertive and myopic, and how they adapt to the daily stresses of life, diminished work opportunities and increasingly rapid and dangerous social changes within their neighborhood.<br/>I rate this book 4 out of 5 because it is exceptionally well written with excellent character development and plot continuity; the story is compelling, making it difficult to put down. I highly recommend The Book Thief.
 The author's approach to this book is definitely unique and intriguing - it is narrated by "Death" (the proverbial dark-hooded, invisible-faced scythe-weilding character).  But honestly, he comes off as more caring and observant than one would imagine.  So definite points for that. The main character (but not only) focus is Liesl, a young girl in Nazi Germany (seems like I'm reading a lot of books of this ilk lately, but only by coincidence).  Liesl is abandoned (well, force of financial and other circumstances) by her mother, and is placed with a family near Munich.  She has low expecations - which are generally met early on, and shows a strong and resilitent character. She makes the best of her lot which, from a family and friends perspective, evolves reasonably well and the portrayal of same is well-written and enjoyable. The book title is a recurring theme in her life - she loves books (even though initially she can't read), and her initiation into "book thievery" is a Nazi-sponsored book burning, where she rescues one unburnt, slightly charred tome. From there her book thievery continues - on random occasions, but the scope of the book is far larger than that.  My primary enjoyment out of this book was the intermittent observations by Death, Liesl's growing circle of friends, the darkening clouds of war and Nazi atrocities becoming visible in village life, and her courage, friendships, and resiliency in the face of daunting times.  Not many books hold my interest, but this one did from the very beginning and was both an enlightening and enjoyable read.  Strongly recommend.
 A vivid narration by Death Himself, this book chronicles the life story of a German girl (the eponymous Book Thief) during the WWII..yes, the Nazi era. Each book she steals depicts an important point in her life in her own history, an important lesson learned, a challenge overcome by her or an important person in her life. This is not a story of a revolution caused by some great name, but a simple story of a child who shakes the simple lives around her with her simple words in a tremendous way. The perspective of the story is to highlight the suffering of the poorest sections of the Nazi society through the eyes of Death with the clear focus being this child who happens to be a book thief. But this thief is remarkable- from her struggle to let go of the grim dreams seeded from her brother's death and mother's abandonment to her growing love for her foster parents, from her gradual victory over the words that were once her enemy to her beautiful friendship with Rudy and Max. She grows so much throughout the book and survives so much that slowly you start suffering everything with her, with Death. Whatever I write in the review cannot justify the way the narration touches you. Just go and read it, you will understand what I mean.<br/><br/>On an end note, Death, you are some narrator!
 I don't even know if it is possible to describe in words just how remarkable and tragic this book is. We've all read books focused on World War II, I'm sure, but there has never been one quite like this. For fear of giving too much away, I won't go into great detail or anything here, except to say that the movie (if you've seen it or plan to do so) is an excellent representation of the book, though with many parts left out, of course. The characters are gripping, the story intriguing and heartbreaking, and the usage of Death as the narrator executed believably and flawlessly. This book sucks you in, tears you apart, and leaves you loving every minute of it. More than that, while being a fairly easy read in terms of the vocabulary (though also brilliant in terms of the writing style), it's extremely heavy in terms of content, with a great deal there to think about long after you have finished reading. In short, this book will haunt you for quite a long time after you think you have finished with it. On that note, I cannot recommend it enough. Please, read it, but keep the tissues handy when you do.
 I read it to see whether it was suitable for my thirteen-year old daughter, I knew nothing about it except that there was a movie coming soon. It is not a great book, its most attractive feature is the way it is written but that is also where most of the difficulties for teen readers will arise: it really has to be a sophisticated reader to put up with the pace of the book, and appreciate the beauty of some of the images that the author creates. For my part, I had never read a book about living as a Nazi civilian during WWII, so that was a new viewpoint for me. In spite of the beatuy amidst the horror that the book portrays, some things do get in the way of it really capturing your interest: most things are beautifully described, even magically so,  but sometimes they feel hollow. I felt like they were a lot of fireworks, lovely, but not much support for the story or character development. Maybe it was intended, to portray the fractured experience of living through the war, but it  makes the book feel contrived and even trivial, as it skates (lightly) over the most unsavoury aspects of war almost right up to the end. It is never sordid, it is sometimes preachy (you do not need to be reminded that Jews did not have shoes when describing the plight of shoe-less German children) and  it has many moments of exquisite beauty. This poetry, unusual in current fiction, much like Ondajte's, was the saving grace that allowed me to plod through to the end.
 “The Book Thief” is both the title of the book and the name given to Leisel, a young girl growing up in Germany during World War II.  In an interesting twist, the narrator to the story is Death, and Death constantly throws in little tidbits about Leisel, observations on humans, and Death has a fascination with colors when people die.  These colors provide a distraction for Death, but it really didn’t do much for me throughout the story as I wasn’t sure if the colors were supposed to represent something symbolic or just an observation at the time Death shows up to claim a soul.  I enjoyed Death as the narrator, but at times he/she/it revealed parts of the story that would happen months or years in advance, and I found that a little annoying at times.<br/><br/>Colors as well as the stories of humans fascinate the narrator, and Death chooses to reveal Leisel’s story from around age 10 to 14.  The reader gets a look into the tragedies of war, the senseless mistreatment of Jews, love of family, love of friends, and the human struggle to find joy during hard times.  Despite Death being the narrator, and dealing with the dark side of war, there were some rays of sunshine that broke through in this story.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the book and especially Death’s observations on war and the job of retrieving souls.  It is sad what humans do to each other, but also encouraging what a few small acts of kindness can do.  It was also interesting to look at the power of words to both kill and to heal.
 It's hard to think of superlative things to say for The Book Thief that hasn't already been covered in the many positive reviews this book has received.  I will just say that the novel (narrated by death) about the life of a young girl and her poor German foster family/friends from 1939 to 1943 living in Munich is deserving of every 5 Star review it has been given.  The book provides insight on what life must have been like for many poor Germans during that time along with an accurate description of the difficulty many Germans must have had in reconciling what was obvious atrocious treatment of the Jews vs. the loyalty demanded by Hitler and the Third Reich.  The events and episodes depicted in this book are often heartwarming and gut wrenching at the same time.  There is a lot in this book that will likely cause the reader to think of life changing or, at a minimum, important events in their own lives that end up being the memories we treasure forever and often make us who we are as individuals.  I would be surprised if any reader of The Book Thief would not enjoy and appreciate the novel, regardless of their reading genre preference.  As a result, I highly recommend this book for anyone as a must read.
 From the unusual narrator to the incredible wealth of detail in the characterizations, Zuzak has managed to write a novel that will live in my memory for years to come.For fear of giving too much away, I will refrain from dissection and simply. tell you why it spoke to me.<br/>I learned to read around the time I turned five; I fell in love with the written word. In the intervening years; I have read thousands of books. I absorbed many--not hundreds of them, but quite a few. I can say that The Book Thief is in that select group of absorbed and loved books.<br/>The story unfolds naturally and events occur realistically. There is no hint of over-manufactured plot or motivation. Anyone searching for a Hollywood type of novel will be disappointed. It is refreshing to read a book that is original in structure as well as content.<br/>One last note:  of all those books that I've read in my life, vanishingly few have caused me to cry. I am not a maudlin person and not easily manipulated. This book is simply touching to a human heart.
 My thoughts about The Book Thief are very hard to put together since this book truly blew me away and I have no idea why I did not read it sooner.  Set in Germany in the 1940's in the midst of World War II, The Book Thief is narrated by Death. Liesel Meminger is quickly introduced as the book thief as she travels to her new foster family with her mother and younger brother.  Her brother dies on the train and Liesel steals her first book, The Grave Digger's Handbook, when it is dropped in the cemetery.  She keeps this a secret until her foster father discovers the book one night.  Together the two explode the words and Liesel's world expands.<br/><br/>It is so hard for me to put words to how I feel about this book.  I know that it has been said by so many but this is truly an unique and mind-blowing book, the history and feeling that went into the story writing is more than I have seen in a very long time.  I tend to struggle with books that are set in such a dark time and have many negative issues but this is the exception.  This book made me sit back and really think about this time in our world's history and what it would have been like.<br/><br/>I did face one large challenge when it came to reading The Book Thief and that was the style in which it was written.  While I enjoyed the narration from Death it often interrupted the flow of the story for me and I had a hard time getting back on track.  Even though this was a challenge it does not affect my overall feelings and rating of this book.  I do not know any other books that fall into this category for me.  Typically, if I have a hard time with the style I do not enjoy the book as much.  Not so with The Book Thief.
 I have had this book on my "to read" list for some time and finally had the opportunity to read it when it became a book club selection.<br/><br/>Although the story's narrator gives hints of where certain segments of the story may go, I was still surprised.  Certain elements of the story made me smile.  Even though this is Germany in World War II, life is difficult for the typical German citizen.  But, in spite all of that there is humor in the story.  Young people are resourceful and find ways to get into mischief, fall in love, entertain themselves and gain understanding of other people.  It is clear from the story that the regular German people did not agree with how Hitler was treating the Jews.  But, yet there was fear and a lack of knowing how to handle the situation.  For those who tried to show kindness to the Jews, there were reprisals.<br/><br/>But, there is much to this story to enjoy.  The character development is good.  There is growth and compassion.<br/><br/>I very much enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it.
 I couldn't say enough about how beautiful this story is. Played against such a horrible time in the world's history, it seems a bit stark. The MC deals with so much pain and misery, but still manages to find good. My heart ached for her. A note to anyone starting out...it takes a few pages to figure out the narrator, but it's worth it, and after a while, you don't mind so much the odd interruptions. It certainly adds to the depth of the story. And the writing, it's absolutely stunning. Not just descriptive, but hauntingly so. Highly recommended.
 The Book Thief had been on my wish list for a long time. When I saw it was being made into a movie, I considered it further. In one order, I added this book and Sarah's Key to my cart. I read Sarah's Key and then picked up this book. Coincidentally, the History Channel was featuring a series entitled the World Wars. These 3 factors combine for some amazing insight. Whereas The Book Thief is from a German perspective during WWII, Sarah's Key is from a Jewish perspective. The television series adds somewhat objective information (nothing is totally objective) about the development of WWII. I do highly recommend both books to be read one after the other -- you might get some of the characters mixed up because they both feature young girls and each experiences the death of their brothers -- but you might see, as I had, that the children are very much the same. And as much as we'd like to condemn those who were complicit by their lack of action during the manslaughter and murder of so many innocent, helpless, and trusting people, you may come to question what you would have done if your life and the lives of your family members would have been on the line.
 I read the book thief the first time soon after it's publication, and the forgot it.  I missed the movie, but will see it some day soon.  When my new book club listed the book thief as a fall selection I tackled it again, and I am so glad I did.  I understood the narrator, and the book thief.  I fell in love with the words and the unusual narration.  And I read it as a book about the holocaust, about the victims of hitler, Germans, Russians, Jews, the whole world and I understood the war without taking sides.  That is a writing feat unparalleled.  The enemy was Hitler, a genius with his words.<br/>Take the time needed to be with the narrator and to see the events through his eyes.  Go slowly, roll the narrative around in your mind.  Visualize the uncommon descriptions, rethink adjectives and adverbs as they are used in this book for the first time in startling ways.  Narrative fiction, or poetry, or is this both?
 Narrated by Death himself, this book manages to draw characters that are genuine because they are so flawed.  They love greatly, and rarely speak about it.  They lose gracefully, and keep going because they must.  They make dangerous choices because they must do what is right.<br/>Liesel Memminger is just 10 years old when she witnesses the death of her little brother and is taken by her mother to live with a foster family in a poor German town during the height of Hitler's insanity.  Although she can barely read, her loving Papa comes to her room each night after she awakens screaming from her nightmare, and together they discover the joy of words.<br/>Rudy is the boy down the street, the one who calls her names, hurls insults and challenges her to steal food. Their interaction is one of adolescent love shown in those contradictory terms we all remember.<br/>Markus Zusak has managed to create characters we care deeply about, people who are good, who are brave, who cannot help who they are.  Her Mama is loud and quarrelsome, yet it is clear she loves Liesel a great deal. Her mourning when Papa is called to war is silent and heart wrenching.  The Mayor's wife, a fragile personality who lives within the loss of her son, has the book collection that Liesel eventually steals from.  Papa and his kind silver eyes is a painter and sometime musician, mostly out of work.  And Max, the secret in their basement, causes the little family to join together in their selfless effort to keep him safe and alive.<br/>I could not put it down, not because I wondered what was going to happen.  Often the book announces what will happen prematurely, because that's not the point.  It's the people, the very real characters that I wanted to spend more time with, to gain more insights into their hearts and souls, that kept me coming back and caused me to regret the ending of our time.  It is a lovely and loving read.
 I had the title, "The Book Thief" written on a scrap of paper that somehow got lost in the pile. Just finished reading it. I read about 30 books a year.  This is the only book that I have ever read where I felt compelled to go back to page 1 and immediately read it again.  I don't like knowing much about a book before I read it.  Just reviewed the Amazon page and was surprised to find this referred to as a "teen book".  I guess you could call "The Diary of Anne Frank" a teen book too.  Breathtaking, sad, thought provoking, devastating.
 Once the weird narration was understood, I got into this book.<br/>It was a decent read once I was 25% in, yet it ended in a strangely unsatisfying way.<br/>Ok well, this book list book is now checked off.<br/>Onward.
 What a wonderful and engaging story.  A story of love, friendship, and acceptance came to life in Nazi Germany during WWII. Each of the characters were personalized, not the typical characters you would expect.  I felt like I knew each of them; what they looked like, their likes and dislikes, and the great love that developed in and between each of them.  I was a little leery of how the narration from death's point of view would work, but oddly enough, he was the perfect narrator.  At a time when war took what it wanted, death was always around.  In going about his dreary job of collecting souls, he took notice of a young girl and her plight when they crossed paths on a train somewhere in Germany.  The Book Thief, Liesel Meminger, steals her first book at the grave site of her brother just before her mother turns her over to child services to be placed in foster care. The Grave digger's Handbook was all she had to remember him.  She grew to love her foster parents, her friends in town, and an unexpected visitor.  It is a wonderful story, a must read.
 I picked up this book after being enticed by its name. I usually only read books which I expect to be able to leave a mark on me, and The Book Thief certainly achieved that and more. It drilled a hole in my heart.<br/>It is the story of a girl Leisel, who steals a book at a tender age when she does not even know how to read. It gives her comfort during a difficult time and she becomes attached to the alphabet. She grows up and becomes a lover of books, and continues to find peace in Nazi Germany by drowning herself in the written word-reading, stealing and story-telling, and sharing the comfort of books with others.<br/>All of us have read about the Holocaust, but this was a very unique perspective-for one, it is from the angle of a non_Jewish girl, showing readers the sorrow many of these people felt as they witnessed the injustices and how many like Leisel s father risked their own lives to give shelter to those who were victims of Hitler's tyranny.<br/>The other unique aspect of this beautiful novel was that it was narrated by death itself, even though the reader tends to forget about it at times, specially during the light_hearted moments. Despite the fact that most if us do not look forward to our demise, the way that death seems to not like what he does, but must do it, and the fact that he 'gently carries the souls in his arms' makes the inevitable seem peaceful.<br/>The characters of Leisel, her father, her friend Rudy, and the refugee Max ,were all very well_developed and came to life with full force.There were so many powerful sentences in this novel, that it's hard to do justice by including only a few in this review. It is a book about the power of words and how they can appease (Leisel)and how they can destroy(Hitler)<br/>Highly recommended for all ages.
 Full disclosure here; I do judge books by their covers and quite often by their titles. I miss out on a lot of great reads this way, but the way I look at it is that there are more great reads in existence than I have existence left for anyway, so no great loss there. I've never read, for instance,  The Corrections] because it puts me in mind of pop quizzes and I won't read  Freedom] because of a George Michael video with spoiled super models and I have never read the  The Book Thief], until now, because I had plenty of those in my life already. Every friend, acquaintance and family member who 'borrowed' a book, in fact. Luckily I had some down time away from home and nothing with me but a kindle so I bought it because it was cheap (five bucks and well worth every penny) and I was bored.<br/><br/>The book does have a lot of book thievery. It begins with a little girl stealing a book about burying the dead and ends with Death stealing a book about the life of little girl. I could kick myself for not reading it sooner. This book is allegedly for a young-adult audience but it reads more like literary fiction that high schoolers could enjoy as well.<br/><br/>Zusak grabs the reader's attention immediately with his choice of narrator, Death, and he keeps it by making him very charming and really kind of funny. In Death's words this is a book "about, among other things: a girl, some words, an accordionist, some fanatical Germans, a Jewish fist fighter and quite a lot of thievery." A simple story about what makes us human.<br/><br/>The girl is Liesel Meminger, an orphan whose greatest joys and greatest sorrows in life come from words. The words used to label her father a communist, the rhetoric of Hitler, the words she flings like knives to wound someone who has hurt her and the words in the books she steals that help her cope with the horrors of Nazi Germany. Her foster father, the accordionist, teaches her to read using her first stolen book, The Grave Digger' Handbook, at the age of ten and from then on she's unstoppable. Whenever she's under stress she copes by stealing a book. While stealing gives her a sense of control over her life her true love is language and literature.<br/><br/>There is so much to love about this book.<br/><br/>Every character in the novel is so believable that you would recognize them instantly if they ever walked down your street. Papa, Hans Huberman, a decent man who keeps his promises regardless of the cost to himself, The great-hearted, ill-tempered, foul-mouthed Rosa Huberman, Max Vandenburg, the hidden Jew who gave Liesel two of her most precious books and most of all Liesel's best friend Rudy Steiner, a vivid, funny, life-loving boy who breaks Death's heart. Even the secondary characters are finely drawn.<br/><br/>And then there is the irresistible prose. In Death's diary he notes of the aftermath of the bombing of Cologne: 'Five hundred souls. I carried them in my fingers, like suitcases. Or I'd throw them over my shoulder. It was only the children I carried in my arms.' And when Liesel finally kisses Rudy, who'd been in love with her for years: 'Liesel kissed her best friend, Rudy Steiner, soft and true on his lips. He tasted dusty and sweet. He tasted like regret in the shadows of trees...'<br/><br/>Not least of all, of course, is
 Don't be discouraged by some of the poor reviews!! Make your own decision. To each his own......<br/><br/>I don't know why this is sold as a youth novel. I'm 66 years old and loved this story. It's not your typical Holocaust book. It's mainly about a little German girl and her adopted family living in the midst of the war and watching what was happening to the Jews. Told by the Grim Reaper (a little off-putting at first but you get use to it and I actually got to like the concept), and what he observes as he "collects souls" is heart wrenching and sad but what would you expect in the middle of Germany during the war. Liesel develops a relationship with a Jewish man that they are hiding; her stepmother starts out being mean but changes; her stepfather adores her; but then it all comes together where they all really do love and care for each other.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to the movie but will be sure to bring plenty of Kleenex with me. Very sobering.
 I liked this story, it was not gripping but plodded along nicely. The story is about relationships between people from different backgrounds built on a shared love of reading. We see Liesel grow and mature against the background of the harshness of war. I like that it was told from the German side though all the Germans in this story appeared to be pro-Jewish. I didn't like that death was the narrator - became almost a likeable character at times which didn't feel right. I didn't like all the subtexts and 'asides' preparing us for what was in the next chapter. Maybe this is because this book is aimed at teenagers. What really took from this book was being told how long someone had left to live and being told someone would die in the next chapter and THEN what the build up to the event was. This confused me especially as characters I thought were dead started re-appearing in the book. As another reader pointed out we don't need to be prepared for suspense, that's part of the enjoyment of reading. This is probably why the story plodded along when it could have been more exciting. Also everything was described as a colour - I didn't really get that. So if you can put all that aside then it's a great read!
 a young girl is placed with a foster family in a small town outside of munich in 1939. on the way to her new home, her brother dies and is buried. the girl sees a book lying about and steals it (it is the gravediggers manual) even though she does not yet know how to read.  she is taught by here kindly foster father, a painter by vocation and an accordion player by avocation and continues stealing books..rescuing one from a Nazi book burning and then stealing others from the wife of the mayor who has her laundry done by the girl's step mother. narrated by death, who eventually and inevitably visits everyone in the book, it is a  look at what life was like in the Nazi Germany  that existed behind the one we all know about.  children grew up doing the kind of things that children do - going to school, playing soccer after school, having adventures and learning about life.  they also had to participate in hitler's youth movement.  the book spirals through a number of substories . the most significant of which concerns the family hiding a jew in their basement and as the war winds down for Germany things get progressively worse for the townsfolk.  this is a beautifully written book with well drawn characters and a strong story line.  it will leave you emotionally drained at the end.  this is a book I will read again and again.
 Articulate and perceptive historical fiction. As a history teacher, I think that this book, narrated by death himself, provides an engaging opportunity to understand the coming of WWII from the perspective of Germans living in Germany. The book thief herself is the daughter of a communist mother, and put up for adoption by a non-Nazi German family due to the persecution of her parents. The tension between the Nazis and the average German on the streets is profound, and little escapades of the book thief herself keep the reader turning pages.<br/><br/>It is also an inspirational story about the power of books. While the Nazis burned books that they believed to be heretical, we make decisions as a society about which books to present to children in schools which also implicitly reflect our principles. Is a forgotten great book so very different from a banned book?<br/><br/>I will be looking for a way to integrate this book into my history class this year. I'm not yet sure as to whether I'll use the book or the movie. The book is richer, but the movie is of high quality and takes less class time.
 Although there is a plethora of books that have been written on Nazi Germany, The Book Thief is an unforgettable story about a Christian girl's plight in a German town.  Definitely one of my top 10 all time favorite books and I would rate it a 5+ Star book.  I had a hard time putting this book down.  The author has chosen "Death" as the story's narrator.  Death provides interesting descriptions as well as foreshadows several of the events.  He  would often talk about life in colors and what he as well as the characters were feeling at the time of death as well as during the events leading to death.<br/><br/>The book opens in 1938 with Liesel, her brother Werner, and her mother on a train.  Liesel's mother is taking the children to an orphanage when Werner dies on the train.  Within the week, Liesel loses her entire family and is struck with nightmares for years to come.  She is placed with a foster family and grows very close to her foster father, Hans, who is a painter.  Rosa, her foster mother, is a tough, rough around the edges, woman who takes in laundry to help support the family.  They have Jewish friends and after the Jewish people are swept from the town, Hans has less work than others because he never joined the Nazi party and is seen as a Jewish sympathizer.  However, the family has enough to survive.<br/><br/>Because of her upbringing, Liesel has never learned how to read.  Hans teaches her to read each night after she is awakened by her recurring nightmare where she relives the death of her younger brother on the train.  She is initially put into a class that is well below her age, but within a few months gets moved to an age appropriate class.  She loves to read, but books are rare.  She takes to stealing them from the mayor's wife library one by one.<br/><br/>Liesel's best friend, Rudy, is both smart and a gifted athlete. Rudy comes from a large family and he helps Liesel steal books and he steals food.  The two have many adventures and clearly share a love for one another.  Liesel brushes off Rudy's attraction for her in the beginning of the story, but recognizes that she indeed loves him by the end of the story.  Rudy is respectful as well as protective of Liesel throughout the book.<br/><br/>Max is the son of a man who Hans fought with in WWI.  The man died in WWI and Hans promises the widow that if her family ever needed anything, that he would be there.  Hans is called upon 20 years later (after Kristal Nacht) as the family is Jewish and Max is hiding in need of help.  Hans takes in Max and hides him in the basement for several years.  He is the family's secret.  Liesel takes to Max and the author creates a touching relationship between the two characters.<br/><br/>As the war progresses, Liesel's town is often subjected to air raid sirens and the neighbors are forced into basement shelters.  During these times, Liesel will read to the neighbors to pass the time in the basement.<br/><br/>The story is full of family sacrifices from Hans/Rosa, to Rudy's family, Max as well as the crotchety next door neighbor.  The story has a very dramatic ending and not what I was expecting.  I did like that all of the characters stories were woven together very well and that at the end of the book, each character/sub-story line, had a defined ending (no hangers).  The last line of the book was just a few words spoken by Death: "I am haunted by humans".  It is an excellent read, a touching story of humanity, and a reminder of the horrific attrocities brought on by Hitler in WWII Germany.
 Such a terrible tale, beautifully written--terrible in the same way that all stories that pertain to this dark slice of history are terrible.<br/><br/>"She was a girl.  In Nazi Germany.  How fitting that she was discovering the power of words."  These few lines from The Book Thief, by Markus Zusak, best sum up the basic bones of the story.  The rest is the meat that is best digested by each individual on their own.  Every once in awhile I come across a book that totally engulfs me and climbs deep inside my soul, never to let go--a book that possesses me to such an extent that I feel as if the story belongs to me.  This is one of these books.<br/><br/>The power of words.  This story examines all sides of that command and demonstrates how easily that power can corrupt the unsuspecting, maim the weak, uplift a wounded spirit, or alter an innocence warped by the perversities of war.  The lives that touched me within these emotionally dynamic and turbulent pages drove me to laughter or tears.  Yet more often, I was inexorably caught within a long wave of my own pondering mind, overwhelmed by "the power of the words."  I'm certain the movie will be a worthwhile see, but I doubt it can match the tragic beauty of the written work.
 Excellent book...kept my interest.  To me, it was seeing the life of the German family during the war...but I know for a fact, the German population was all for Hitler and his henchmen, even though the book shows the average German under the heel of the military and police....I have a hard time buying that as we all can see films of the German people salivating over the monster Hitler, and all of the dead Jews.  I do believe the average Germans were the ones that gave the Nazi party the encouragement to do exactly what they did.  Yes, the German people suffered towards and after the war, but to me, the great majority opened the door and welcomed the killings that led to their sufferings.  It's the children in the book that are also victims and this book clearly shows that but when men crave war, it's inevitable the innocent children are victimized.
 At first glance, you may think this novel is the story of Liesel, a young girl whose mother gives her up to a poor, foster family as Hilter's reign in Germany is on the rise.  On the trip to her new home, she watches her brother die and steals her first book.  She can not read but is fascinated by the words it contains.  Papa teaches her to understand the words while soothing her nightmares.  Mama vocalizes the words that teach her to face head on the hand life has dealt.<br/><br/>And you may think this is another story about the ravages of war and the Holocaust.  But it's not.  The Book Thief is the story of the power of words.  We learn how words are used to exert dominance and control and how words can express fear and grief.  But Liesel shows us how words can build friendships and fill empty hearts with love.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is set during a dark period of world history.  It is beautifully poetic about how life was viewed through the eyes of an innocent child.  A story, like The Book Thief that can bring me to tears, is a story I want to savor in my mind and save on my bookshelf forever.
 I almost missed out on this tale. I downloaded the sample and was initially confused by the layout: bolded and unbolded text, inconsistent spacing, centered, left justified, oh my! I found it messy-looking, for want of a better description. I am SO glad I didn't let my first impressions rule. This is a gem of a novel, as many of you will know already, as I'm several years late to the party. "The Book Thief" sprinkles literary gems across each page, utilizes the most unique narrator in the history of novels, and includes characters that leap from the page to be held in the heart forever. I miss them greatly already. A must read for all readers and writers alike.
 This is another WWII story of the pain and suffering behind the battle lines, focusing on a spunky, Scout-like girl. She develops such a love of books and reading, that she is willing to risk all to steal them. The tale,  narrated by a jaded, but plausible, alternative to the Christian version of the Grim Reaper, never stalls. However, I found the character of Max, or at least his creative writings, flawed. The writings were written in love and devotion for the Book Thief girl, but I was not convinced as to the basis of these emotions. There was quite an age difference, enough to make romantic love impossible, and not much  passed between the two that convinced me that his feelings were real. In short, their relationship lacked development. Thus, his writings struck my ear as too sweet; a little cute, and out of character for an otherwise serious Jew who was being tormented by the Nazis. Otherwise, this was a great read.
 This book was one that took breath away and keeps the reader awake and hopeful. It made me realize that life has sharp edges and beautiful pieces in the darkest of times. That wonder can be found and words are a source of good.<br/><br/>This book says so much about the darkness and the greatness of humanity and reminded me why it is that I love to read above all else.<br/><br/>Once I picked this book up it was difficult to put it down and continue with anything else in my day to day life. The pull of the story called and was insistant for my return. I hoped against hope for a peaceful and joyful end. I wished that the world was a place full of joy and light. I hoped for happiness for this lovely girl. I wanted so badly to know her story.<br/><br/>The book and books of her story did not disappoint. A truly emotional journey, that I now know but, would pick up again and read with as much joy as I just had... again. A book to be enjoyed again and again.
 Being pushed by others around me to read it, I finally gave in and read The Book Thief. A cousin of mine told me I, just like many, would be bawling their eyes out at the end. Me having a rock solid heart when viewing/reading entertainment and rarely crying, I scoffed at such a statement. Haha, I was dead wrong.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is an emotional story that is very interestingly narrated by Death (yes, the Grim Reaper you're thinking of) which provides a fresh aspect to this book. The main character is a girl growing up in Nazi Germany with foster parents. She goes through adventures with her friend and (un-aware) lover Rudy Steiner, shares emotional moments with the Jew her family hides, smirks at her loving mother calling her a "Saumensch", and listens to the soft and pleasing sound of her accordion Dad as he teaches her to read. This book is truly one that'll stay in your memories and will be pounding your heart during the time following reading this amazing story. I urge you to pick it up. I don't read books as much as my time allows me to, but I can easily say that I've never read a book better than this one.<br/><br/>*****SPOILERS*****<br/><br/>The hardest part for me to get through was when Liesel held Rudy in her arms and wept. And when she kissed him, as she was kissing him, that paragraph lasted at least 10 minutes for me as my monkey sounding sobs filled the air and my snot bubbles popped. And her time as she laid with her dead father were equally as emotional and heart-wrenching. And the comments by Death, especially the last line - "I am haunted by humans" - are things that I'll never forget.
 It's been quite a while since I've posted a five star review and this novel earned all five.  Set during war torn Nazi Germany and narrated by Death through its many personas - omniscient, cruel, compassionate, reluctant, apathetic, resigned, cynical - "The Book Thief" depicts life in a small German town during the Holocaust.  Like Death, I am forever amazed by the beauty and compassion that can usually be found within the most wretched of human nature.  Sometimes you have to excavate it, as in the case of Rosa Huberman and Frau Holtzapfel; at other times it is a beacon, as with Hans Huberman, attracting those in need of its healing powers.  In its most distressing state, beauty and compassion lie dormant, as in the case of Alex Steiner, who knew that "somewhere, far down, there was an itch in his heart, but he made it a point not to scratch it.  He was afraid of what might come leaking out."  The only aspect of human nature void of any compassion, gutted of beauty, is that of war.<br/><br/>I am equally amazed by the power and beauty of words, as evident in the creation of this text and central to rescue of its main character, Liesel Meminger.  In the hands of Zusak, words paint portraits on the landscape of world history and bring to life the experiences of people, the wreckage of war and the personification of death.  Off the lips of Liesel words soothed, provided hope and created a bond with Max that even war could not destroy.<br/><br/>Until my encounter with "The Book Thief", I could truthfully say that I've never known anyone - victim or hero - who has lived through or died from a war. Now, I feel as though I do.  Much kudos to Zusak for an incredible reading experience and many thinks to Frank J. for the recommendation.
 This is a book that was published a while back and I had no knowledge tell i found out a movie was being made of it.  I love reading books that movies are based off of.  So i purchased it and missed seeing the movie at the theater so i put off reading it and reviewing it.  Now it coming to netflix soon and all my friends are wanting to see it to.  So we all read it now we are waiting for the movie to arrive.<br/><br/>My thoughts on this book i loved it as much as i enjoy reading Diary of Anne Frank i love how both books give you a glimpse into this very interesting piece of our history.  I was not alive back then but i am curious as to how things happen and what the Jews felt like having to hide and being persecuted as they were.  It took me a while to read it but that mostly cause you absorbing a lot of great information and you get caught up in what is happening.  It a very clever story and i thoroughly enjoy it and i hope i love the movie just as much.
 I have always been interested in this tragic period in history, especially the German side of World War I and II, being that I am half German, and holder of a Master's Degree in History and Education. I have always felt as if the German people were dealt a horrible blow, but not by any means as horrible as were the Jewish people. This book shows that not all Germans were oriented to Hitler's mad side of hatred towards non-Aryan peoples. It shows that there were some people that were trying to survive during a time in history when survival was something that was breathed, day in and day out.<br/>It takes just a little bit to get into the writing style, being that Death is personified as the narrator of the book. It kind of freaks the reader out a bit, until you just go with it, and find that, indeed, this is about the only way this tale could be told.<br/>This is one of the best reads I have read in the past 48 years, which is how long I have been reading :)
 Zusak hooks the reader from the start through the Narrator.  From this perspective, emotions and interpretation of events unfold multiple (MRI)-layered analyses of what each interlocking character is experiencing within such desperate wartimes.  Readers are challenged to see the evil in the good as well as the good in what appears as evil.  Yes, evil is real -  yet one's interpretation must be tempered by the facts and timing.  When tragedy and evil strike, real freedom is found in making  our choices based upon the moral values of our integrity &amp; character.  For this reader &amp; reviewer, I experienced the reality of God's Presence in the midst of absolute evil.  The presence of hope (at times thinly veiled) is undeniable.  The power of words and reading open avenues of mental freedom amidst social &amp; political oppression.  Art is life as well as an avenue to create more life with deeper relationships.  The Book Thief challenges each reader to never surrender your freedom &amp; responsibility to dream...to reach forward for life's best - even in the face of death.<br/>Rev. Dennis O.

 This book is like nothing I have ever read before.  It is written from the point of view of the Angel of Death during the time of the Holocaust in Germany.  Ostensibly about a young girl displaced by the war and taken in by a foster family and her life there, it manages to portray the small, day to day experiences and effects on people still trying to live their lives in those terribly distorted times.  It shows one girls struggle to grow up and her passion for books, and - it is  truly remarkable book, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I have not seen the movie.  I always prefer to read first and view second.  So I have no idea how they could take this subtle, complex, horrifying and yet fantastic book to screen.  My imagination, however, was able to handle easily all the complexities.<br/><br/>It was, in my opinion, one of the truly outstanding books I have ever read about the Holocaust times.
 This book gave me some real insite into what regular Germans went through during WWII.  Most of us have only heard about what the Jews went through, which was truly horrible.  I had never heard of the hardships that a war like WWII had on the everyday German people.  Some, especially the children, were never even aware of what actually happened to their Jewish friends and neighbors. The story is well written, and it really makes you think about what their own government put them through.  The food shortages were terrible, and most of the time they had little to eat because of the cost of the war.  The factories and work places were shut down, and most people lost their jobs, and had no way of supporting and feeding their families.  The little girl, who is the protagonist of the story, was starving along with her friends, and stealing a book was something that she couldn't explain, but it helped her get through her very awful existence.  She learns to read from the Jewish man her family hides in her basement.  It's a very touching story that everyone should read.  I recommend it, and look forward to seeing the movie.
 We listened to this on CD and I have to confess I don't read (nor listen) to many books in this niche (WW II/Holocaust), but it is gripping! Starts off a little twisted as the narrator is the "angel of death" and he basically speaks in metaphors about his "job." After we get more into the main character and how she came to her living situation, the angel steps back more and I must admit I enjoyed the lesser role "he" played. The mother is harsh and makes the CD more towards an older audience. The father is a "Wow" and is the absolute most endearing character in the story. Anyway, the character are so real that I readily admit that I bawled at the climax. In all. this CD gave us 14 1/2 hours of pleasure on a very long road trip and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to feel WWII without getting too much battle drama.
 I doubt that any other book I will ever read will touch me, tear at my heart, sear into my memory and thoughts, as this has. It truly is ART.  As a painter uses oils, or pastels, to create his art, Markus Zusak uses WORDS, and the result is breathtaking!  Heartbreaking! Indelible! - - with moments of fear, suspense, grief, helplessness, tenderness, beauty - and love, even in the ugliness, sheer evil and inhumanity of Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>Although the immediate characters are fictional, the reality of the holocaust at that time in history, must never be forgotten, or it will be repeated.  Those who know of Anne Frank, Schindler, and so many other names woven into the fabric of that time, now have another story to add to their list of recommended reading for newer generations.  Humanity, both now and in the even distant future, must feel the reality and not just know the facts.
 This book is such a rare find in this single premise:<br/>Death tells you who is going to die before they do. Why is this to critical to the story? Because it is not always obviousin a book who we should love most, who we should treasure as they interact with each other. When Death tells you the character is going to die ahead of time, you suddenly treasure every word of that character. Each interaction is incredibly poignant, each slight given by others that much more devastating. You find yourself wanting to intervene, to set things right and to say, "NO! Tell ___ that ____"! Instead, we, as is Death are merely observers in a story that does not rely upon its fantastic element to survive.<br/>My only caveat: there are things in this book I did not fully grasp, and I believe some of them are also cultural, so I will let them slide. However, the written story by a certain character about Hitler made no sense to me. I felt like that gem fell flat. Maybe I expected something different?<br/>Overall, though, I give five stars for original thinking, the ability to bring the realities of the war home, and the premise that made me cry even when I knew what was coming.
 I may not be a connoisseur of writing book reviews, but I know what I like and what I enjoy...and when I'm finished reading it, I wish there were more words to enjoy!<br/><br/>Being in my mid 60's, and having a family member who was a concentration camp survivor and my own father a WWII veteran, I've read quite a few books of this "era" in our world history.  All of the books left me with different but somewhat similar feelings when I completed them. I still can't believe there are people who think the whole Hitler issue was not true.  I definitely wanted to read this book BEFORE I saw the movie in the theaters.  I was hoping to enjoy the book before Hollyweird screwed up the book in making their movie, and I always try to encourage everyone I speak with to read the books before seeing the movies because there's always so much more enjoyable material in the books than can be put into movies.<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed the characters in the book and the style of writing was definitely unique.  The ending was a definite welcomed surprise.  I have encouraged many of my friends, family and acquaintances to read this book.  I hope this author writes more!
 I'm giving this book 5 stars because I can't split stars and it's definitely not a 4 star read. The Book Thief chronicles the life of an orphaned German girl during WWII and is told from the perspective of Death. I struggled with that concept and that is part of the reason I didn't want to give it 5 stars. The author seemed to almost over develop the characters and there were so many characters that the book is a bit dawdling at times. It seems to wander at times without a plot.That being said, I enjoyed the read and would highly recommend it. I don't regret pushing through some of the rough spots to get to the sad but beautiful ending.The main characters are well done and developed in such a way that the reader almost feels a kinship to them. Death does a great job narrating. He is insightful and yet confused by the human race simultaneously. He is indeed very taken with the book thief and almost grows to have feelings for her. A different perspective is also brought to light in that we see the atrocities of that war through the eyes of the average German citizen. Sadness and loss were felt by so many and lives were forever altered, irrevocably. It brings to light that not all were sold on Hitler's hatred and just wanted to do what is right for their fellow human beings, no matter the cost. This would make a wonderful book club read as there would certainly be much discussion.
 As one might expect from a novel set in WWII Germany, The Book Thief was absolutely heart-wrenching. It is told from the perspective of two unlikely characters: Death and Liesel Meminger, a young foster girl; both are equally compelling, but some of my favorite parts of the story were when Death observed Liesel and those around her. It is a testament to author Markus Zusak's skill as a writer that he is able to unflinchingly describe the incomprehensible tragedies and horrors of one of the darkest times in history as deftly and accurately as he details the great absurdities of human nature - often in the same passage. Most impressive of all is Zusak's ability to take vast themes and make them essential to the relatively small lives of his characters.<br/><br/>These inconsequential people in an obscure German town take on monumental significance as Zusak uses them to illustrate the best and worst of human nature: unthinking hate and all-encompassing love, cowardice and bravery, fearful self-preservation and selfless bravery. The moment when - with one small act - an ordinary man defied the propaganda-fueled war machine of Nazi hate, moved me to tears (and that wasn't the only time I cried while reading this book).<br/><br/>The Book Thief is storytelling at its best. When I had finished this amazing, soul-stirring novel, I was reminded of why I love books. Highly recommended.
 Why have I never read this book before?  It is horrifying and beautiful. It is a sad story of happiness in a time of evil, of lives lived and lost, of a compassionate  grim reaper who carries souls from the last place their bodies occupy and is haunted by humans. I mourned the losses and was touched by that compassion. What a beautiful gift to humanity this story is. May we never forget its lessons.
 Anyone who is truly interested in the life of a young girl during the Holocaust would love this book. The Book Thief is a work of fiction so it is not a true story but with how it is written you could believe it. From the first line I fell in love with this book, Liesel Meminger is such a brave and spirited little girl and you can see how she becomes a brave and spirited young lady. Overall, buy this book because it's worth it. There is some heartache in here but what would you expect. So I hope you choose this book and that you love it as much as I did.
 It took me a chapter or two to really connect with death as the narrator, but I grew to love the odd but rather enchanting way death described things. I loved the stress on words in this book, and I was moved to tears several times near and at the end. I wanted to know more about Liesl during the rest of her life. I loved the interactions between her and Rudy. This was a wonderful book!
 I found the characters and their relationships to be very interesting. The story is a glimpse of the life of an adopted girl in Munich at the beginning of Hitler's maniacal reign of terror.  The characters, relationships, and story made it a compelling read for me, but it could have been better told.  The narrator of the book is the character of Death.  The first chapter was almost unreadable for me because of the awkward writing for this character.  When I gave it a second chance, I was able to get through that first chapter and get caught up in the other characters and their story.  Each subsequent encounter with Death's musings on life and death were awkward as well.  The author is talented, but the book could have been much better if he didn't try so hard to be unique.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I do recommend this book.  I think the main characters will stick with me for a long time.
 There are plenty of reviews about this book here. Some love it as I did, others hate it and the rest seem to be precisely in the middle. Personally I think it was a unique spin on WWII in Nazi Germany. It is told by the grim reaper or aka Death. It follows the story of a girl whom he nicknames The Book Thief. It follows her life and in particular a time span of four years in a small town outside Munich. The main character is a strong willed young girl who's life is filled with many characters all of which are interesting and instrumental in her life. However brief they may be. The one thing I found interesting is Death is somewhat of a spoiler of who dies in the book. He tells how some characters will die and in some cases when. Though it did not discourage me from reading. It was just enough in some cases to keep going and while you know some people will die and you think you know how or when you will be wrong. I did not get through this book swiftly as I have with others but it was a fluid read. I felt myself loving the fact that I in a way was like the book thief and can not get enough to read at times.
 I picked up this book a year ago or so, and tried to read it, but couldn't get it to grasp hold.  Then, in trying to help my son find a historical fiction book to read for school, I stumbled upon it again, and this time, it stuck.<br/>I have read many books based on the WW2 era, this easily tops the list as one of my favorites.  The author really helps you to connect with Leisel and her trials in life, and helps you to see a different view of WW2.  It's easy to look back and see the Germans as bad people for what was done, but this book reminds us that not all Germans agreed with the Nazi mindset, and instead saw value in each individual of the human race.  This book, above all, shows the power of words, and their effect on people who need to hear them.<br/>Pick up this book, push through the first few confusing chapters, it's well worth it in the end!
 How do you describe a very interesting unique book.  Death is the Narrator and this is not a spoiler.  It becomes very apparent in the first chapter. Death tells the story of the Book Thief or Lisle Memminger. This is a war story about a a German family living in a small German town, on a run down street, in a small home.  We see the war through this German family and their friends. There are a few German words and phrases along the way.  I enjoyed the book very much and loved reading every word.  I would also recommend seeing the movie.  There are some differences.  I ordered the book while I watched the movie.  As I read the book the characters came alive and I saw the actors from the movie in my mind, in each page I read.  The book came alive for me.  Death tells a very good story and even has a sense of humor.  Three are a few side trips as death leaves Himmel Street and visits a few places to pick up the souls of the dead, a battle field, and a concentration camp.  I highly recommend this book and the moive.
 A very beloved book that I have read at least 4 times already. The book grabbed me at the first few sentences with death narrating and while it seems to make the story slow at times, it is entertaining because death is such an unlikely character for a story narrator. The Book Thief  was probably one of the rare books that had me teary eyed at times because while Liesel makes the most of her situation and finds solace in the books she steals, it is very heart-rending to read about the horrors that she experienced in her young life. I did feel that this books was little heavy for the 9-12 age range that is listed for it, but it parallels Diary of Anne Frank and makes reading the subject matter easier for those that may have struggled through Anne Frank's story.
 I purchased this book based on all the 5-star reviews posted on this sight and the subject matter.  It is supposedly written for young adults but I feel the subject matter may be too grim or not sufficiently understood by too young a reader. I suggest parents read the book first to judge for themselves before allowing their children to read it.<br/><br/>This book is narrated by Death; an interesting if somewhat chilling concept, but due to the fact that it is written about WW2, the narrator is entirely appropriate.<br/><br/>The book is about Liesel Meminger, a young girl who is handled over to guardians near Munich, as her father, a Communist, has disappeared and her mother is too ill to care for her and her younger brother. The brother dies and she finds a book entitled, The Gravedigger's Handbook" in the snow near where he is buried. She impulsively steals it, although she cannot read, and takes it to the guardians' home, Rosa and Hans Hubermann.<br/><br/>Hans helps Liesel cope with nightmares and also teaches her to read. Hans is a not-too-successful painter, primarily because he has not joined the Nazi party. Part of his reluctance to join is due to his life being saved during WW1 by a Jewish soldier. He gets to repay his debt to his Jewish comrade when his son, Max, comes to his house seeking shelter. This is obviously a very dangerous situation for the family as they could be arrested and killed for rescuing a Jew.<br/><br/>While Max hides in the basement, he uses white paint fron the cans stored there to paint over pages of Mein Kampf, a book he used as part of the subterfuge to escape. These pages are then used by him to create stories and drawings to entertain Leisel.  In the meantime, she continues to steal books when they are available because she has learned to love the printed word.  She also begins write her own stories.<br/><br/>Rather than being a true war story, this is a complex tale about the human condition. It is about how a young girl who has lost so much in her 11 years learns to cope with that loss and gain joy from simple things.  It is about kindness, and the repayment of old debts.<br/><br/>I recommend this book very highly.
 When I was eleven, my parents gave me accordion lessons. I wanted to learn the piano, but an accordion was what they could afford. With each year, I grew more and more embarrassed by the musical instrument I played. I loved to play it but I was mortified that someone might find out about it. Other kids can be very cruel. Over the next decades, my accordion playing disappeared and the bellows of my instrument rotted with disuse, but from time to time, I or my husband would reveal that secret, initiating some laughter from friends. After reading TheBook Thief, I will never be able to joke about the accordion again. Instead, I will feel regret, a bit of shame, and will have to fight to hold back tears. As a reader and writer, I immediately connected with the book thief, understanding the power of words, celebrating and grieving with the residents of Himmel Street, drowning in tears with each revelation from this agonizingly, heartbreakingly beautiful book. However, I never expected to be haunted by the honor, decency, and humanity of her father and the priceless gift and image of his accordion.
 This is a tough one! The beginning of the book was confusing and a little hard to follow along, but it held my attention nonetheless. The story appears to be told from Death itself. He tells the story of a young girl named Liesel and how she grows up in Germany during World War II. The story is fantastic and quite humorous at times. There are many wonderful characters, my favorite being "Papa." I also love Rudy! I think this is a great book that everyone should definitely read. There are things we could all learn from reading this and I am an avid reader myself so the idea of a "book thief" intrigued me. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 was the ending; it broke my heart! But I still highly recommend this! Read it.
 This is a beautifully written book that provides a child's portrayal of WWII. Very little is said about the crimes against Jews yet enough is shown to prove that not all people are cruel. Without giving too much away, there are many heartfelt moments and I cried several times. I haven't seen the movie yet but this is well worth a read. Note, it has a somewhat slow start but really gets rolling around the middle through the end.
 “First the colors. Then the humans. That’s usually how I see things.” Death, the narrator of this story, leads us through this riveting adventure of a powerless girl, Liesel Meminger, caught in the midst of World War II. Not only does this fascinating story put us in Liesel’s small shoes, but in the downtrodden shoes of a Jewish person. Markus Zusak, the author of The Book Thief, is adept at showing perspective and humanizing Hitler’s enemies and the enemies Liesel is supposed to hate but comes to care for. One of the many things I’ve learned from this book is to always consider others’ feelings and their situation. From reading this book, I have realized that Hitler and The Nazi Party brainwashed Germans to dehumanize Jews and act on these cruel beliefs, systems, and punishments. I definitely recommend The Book Thief to anyone who loves historical fiction and a poignant story that will change your life.
 I loved this book.  I read a lot and I don't say that often.  This was a great book.  I understand that it is considered a Young Adult book, but it is complex and thought-provoking enough for adults.  That Death is the narrator was a plot twist that was present from the outset, &amp; this just made the book more intriguing.  I also appreciated that while set during WW2, the reader sees the war from the perspective of a German girl living with foster parents, which is a viewpoint to which I'm unaccustomed.  Zusak gives enough foreshadowing that the reader wants to read quickly to reach that point in the story to find out how that particular event occurred. I am recommending The Book Thief to everyone I know.  This book will probably go in my stack of Books-To-Read-Again-Someday.
 This book is uniquely written from the point of view of Death (a surprisingly likable narrator). I don’t want to spoil the story, so I won’t go into the plot. But if you don’t make time to read this book, you are really robbing yourself of something phenomenal. I don’t often review books, especially ones with lots of reviews. I make an exception here, because I believe that everyone should read this one, and because it felt wrong not to.
 First of all, I read this book because my 9th grade son chose it for his English class free read and I like to read the books that are assigned to him.  I devoured it.  Though I read it a couple years ago, the details of the story are now out of focus, but the essence of it STILL remains with me.  I read a lot of Fiction, YA Fiction, Historical Fiction, nonFiction, Children's books, and Classics.  This book remains in my top 10.  This story was beautifully written in a loving, yet unorthodox manner.  Death narrates.  That, by itself, caught my attention.  It is also a bit of Historical Fiction of WWII, but from the side of a young German Girl who has to witness the atrocities of her country and try to remain safe from persecution, while NOT being Jewish.  Oh, did I also mention her family is hiding a Jewish man in their basement?  There are plenty of sad parts (given the theme), but the ending truly touched me and has stayed with me 2 years later.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
 Death spoils the ending for you many times, but when characters finally get around to dying, it still breaks my heart and starts the tears because before the inevitable, we get to know all these wonderful moments of the characters being themselves that you feel more and more the tragedy and waste of such fine characters dying.<br/><br/>It's an ambitious novel with Death as its narrator and being set in Nazi Germany. I believe it was well researched and sensitively presented and focused on people's humanity. When I say it focused on people's humanity, it does it in the spirit of a story for children and young adults. It isn't complicated or overly political, but it makes the politics feel very present and disruptive to the flow of the lives we're trying to live, and it does it with characters participating in so much mirth, mischief, and maturation. There are occasional illustrations for a fantastical, children story's rendition of Hitler as a manufacturer of words and people. Detailing the quirks, triumphs, defeats, and antics of each character would endear you most to this story. It has many surprising little details of people's behavior that's very endearing and relateable.
 This book is another vivid reminder of just how brutally awful the WW II persecution of Jews and other selected outcasts was carried out by Nazi Germany.  Very interestingly, the story is told by the "grim reaper" who collects the soles of those who die.  The book thief is a very bright young girl who ends up living with an older German Couple after her brother dies and her mother is taken by the Nazis because as an accused  communist.  The story follows the girls quest to learn to read by stealing books over a period of time.  Several very interesting characters are met along the way -- Rudy a young boy, Max a Jew that the family hides and protects in their basement, the local Burgermeister and his wife.  The girl's struggle and the sad depiction of how really nasty WW II Nazi Germany was really comes to life in this book.  This book should be required reading for high school seniors.
 And there it was, as the Kindle told me I was passing 95%, a rare and welcome surge of sadness, not because the book is coming to a sad ending, but simply because it is coming to an ending. The author earns the tears with his characters and storytelling, but the tears are also from the ache of a beloved journey reaching its destination.<br/><br/>The lyricism of Markus Zusak’s words, and the turns of his remarkable story, are hard to let go. Zusak pulls us gently into the story of Liesel Meminger and makes us love her, along with her adopted and extended family. The Book Thief, I suspect, will be remembered as one of the greatest works of early 21st-century literature, but if my suspicions are wrong, it will still be a book that lingers with me personally until its narrator comes to visit me.<br/><br/>I watched the wonderful film that has been made of The Book Thief after I’d finished about a quarter of the novel, and I was struck by how well the movie honors the book while ably transforming the story from one medium to another. Inevitably, the book is a deeper and richer experience, but the film is worth the investment of time as well.<br/><br/>The decision to buy and read this book came after a reader I respect said she would rank it with To Kill A Mockingbird among the best she’d ever read – the highest of praise. I knew little more about the story, and for those who want to discover the book as I did, I’ll leave it at that. Highly, highly recommended.
 At first when I started this book my first reaction was, why is Death the narrator ? I continued reading. This is such a different book about the holocaust . So different and so powerful. Many people do not want to believe that this even happened. It did happen and such a dark period in history. Most holocaust stories are written from the Jewish survivors point of view, and there are many and most are very moving. This story is written from a young German girl's perspective.<br/>The whole story is very well written and presented. At the end the author answers a lot of question one might have about how the story came to be and why certain things were done the way they were. Seeing some of the movie scenes and the trailer makes you also want to see the whole movie.<br/>Life was so very different at that time in history. My hope is that reading this book or seeing the movie renews interest in books. Books can be very powerful. This book was a very good read.
 Unique perspective on the people experiencing WWII--from those living every day lives within Germany and their challenges in coping with live under the boot of Hitler and his Nazis.  Beautifully and lovingly told from the biggest victor of that war--Death,<br/><br/>If you have seen the movie, you will know the book almost to the page, but not with equivalent character development, depth and insight.  Nonetheless, having seen the movie the book will be more easily followed and understood.  Both are wonderfully well conceived, realized and delivered to we fortunate enough to share them.  The characterizations, characters/actors and settings are directly traceable between movie and book as is the development and realization of the plot.  Not Hollywood shoot 'em up this one--full of special effects, blow us, crude language and overdone sex--just beautifully conceived, imaginatively written, perfectly executed and delivered human story in both mediums.  If you like an interesting, real-life human drama, rich with the realities, fears, frustrations and joys of real-live victories; you with treasure this book and the movie it generated.
 I had been told by a blogging friend that this book was amazing.  It lingered on my TBR list for a while until my book club offered it as a choice for next month.  As I wasn't thrilled with the other offerings, I was quite vocal in my desire that this be selected as our next book.  I am so glad I spoke up so forcefully on the side of this book (seriously, the others were dull).  This book is simply brilliant.  It will move you in ways you never expected and surprise you in both good and bad ways.  When I first started reading it, I was confused.  The first few chapters were weird to me because they were unlike anything I had read in the past (which is part of the beauty of this book).  The fact that Death is telling the story and can be quite funny at times (although often in unintentional ways), is sheer genius.  Death has a way with words that draws you in and lulls you.  The words become more than words.  They paint a picture; comfort you; surprise you.  You know early on what is going to happen to many of the characters, as Death is very straight up about these things, and you don't want to believe some of it, and in reading, you often forget.  When you do remember, as Death likes to remind you of upcoming events, or read the actual events you are somehow surprised, saddened and angered.  The characters are well fleshed out and you will fall in love with almost every one of them for different reasons.  They show you the life of Germans during WWII.  While Nazi's are obviously featured in the book, they are not the focus of it, other than how their actions affect the average citizen.  These are not bad people, but people doing what they must to survive and maintain some sort of normalcy in a very un-normal time.  These characters have depth is ways some writers can only dream of.<br/>I loved this book so much I ordered my own copy (the one I read came from the library) so I can read it again at my leisure and sent a copy to my dad as a gift.  This will now be at the top of my gift giving list for readers.  I hate that in the US it's marketed as YA because I'm afraid a lot of people will skip over it.  I would certainly not consider this typical YA fare.  Yes, high schoolers could (and should) read it, but the appeal of this book extends far beyond the teen years.  Simply put, you MUST read this book.  You will not regret it.
 When I started this book I was not too crazy for it. It took a while to really get into this story as the plot emerges slowly and builds momentum. I also knew that a movie would come out from this story, and I wanted to get in before it hit the theaters. You do have to keep in mind that this book is geared more for young adults. If you can keep that in mind, and stick with it, when you will finish you may realize that maybe my four star rating is not that far off. It is sad, heroic, and cruel time period seen through the eyes of a child. It takes place in a time period and in a part of the world under the tyranny of a murderous hateful regime where reality is often confused with the need for survival. I would recommend this book so long as you can be a bit patient and can understand the real target audience for this is for young adults. You have to be a fan of this time period and expect there are some slow parts, but, I just can't give it three stars as it does deserve more and to say five stars is just an exaggeration... in my humble opinion.
 The best book I've read in years-a real page turner and so true to human character-at once certain deserving characters and humans in general. Would highly recommend to anyone who likes Historical Fiction and an author who can paint pictures through the use of words-deserves more than 5 Stars!<br/>I want to add that for the first time in my adult life (I'm 68)when I finished the book I was tempted to start rereading it.<br/>To tell who the Narrator is would probably encourage people to read it but it wouldn't be fair to push Readers into it; they will suspect soon enough into the book. And, I have say the very last short sentence blew me away but one must not go there until they get there err they ruin an astounding picture of something we would never suspect.<br/>Re: the Narrator and the way he paints his canvas. I'm not a professional writer and have trouble putting into words what he was able to. The best I can do is comment on the ways he coins phrases, twisting the senses in a way that is contradictory yet make total sense in our minds and blasts away at our senses, thus making sense out of what shouldn't make sense.<br/>Many novels need many characters and even more pages to tell a story that is limited in time and scope. Markus Zusak is able to take 4 main Characters put them in to a period of 6 years, give or take, and make an astute statement about the human condition that is timeless, that gives us great pause.
 Just truly one of the best books I've read (and I'm reading all the time).  This is the story of love, connections and hope in the face of Nazi Germany.  Liesel is given to adoptive parents when her mother can't take care of her anymore.  She immediately forms a bond with "Papa" who sits with her at night through her nightmares and teaches her to read.  Liesel is in love with learning and she "steals" books whenever she can.  Her first was The Gravedigger's Manual" from her brother's gravesite.  Another from the ashes of a Nazi book burning.  Liesel next bonding is with her neighbor and co-conspirator, Rudy.  Liesel also befriends the rich woman her adoptive mother does wash for.  She sneaks books from their massive library until she is welcomed there.  After a time, Liesel's family harbors a Jewish man, Max, who hides in the basement teaching her more letters as he paints over the pages of Mein Kampf and gives it to her as a notebook to write her own story.  Love and profound relationships trump over the ravages and violence of Nazi Germany.
 This is a beautifully written book. The imagery is unique and made me feel like I was there, living in the dusty streets of Himmel. My daughter was given this as a summer reading assignment. I decided to read it first and I'm so glad I did. It has become one of my top 10 favorite books of all time.
 Seriously, I have emailed the President, the First Lady, my senators, my reps, Keith Olbermann, Rachel Maddow.  . . I guess I should also try Glenn Beck and Fox News.<br/><br/>How do I find the words to describe the absolutely stunning novel by Markus Zusak in his 2005 "The Book Thief?"<br/><br/>The first attraction is the unusual choice of narrator:  Death. Death  is fitting, since the story takes place in Nazi Germany during World War II. Death is kind, cynical, funny, big-hearted. Death does his job, but he doesn't understand the way humans treat one another and why there is war.<br/><br/>The main story is of Liesel Meminger, an orphan brought to Molching, just outside of Munich. Her foster parents seem an unlikely pair: a loud-mouthed, swearing fish wife and a calm, kind painter who plays an accordion. Each has something to teach Liesel about life, as do all her neighbor friends, especially Rudy and the Mayor's wife.<br/><br/>When the Hubermann's take the chance to help a Jew by hiding him in their basement, the stakes are raised for the whole family, to keep their humanity in a world gone mad. Max endures only through their kindness and compassion. Liesel finds him fascinating. He writes and draws stories for her on transformed pages of Mein Kampf.<br/><br/>Liesel becomes a book thief as she longs to learn to read and write, stealing one book at a time and then using those books and those words to heal others.<br/><br/>In a time of rancorous debate and name-calling here in America, Zusak's commentary on the rise of Hitler and the power of words is an important voice. THE POWER OF WORDS. . . may we never, ever forget.<br/><br/>If you have not yet had the pleasure of reading The Book Thief, find a copy today. It will change the way you think about life, death, and words. And that's not just a bunch of hot air.
 The end was touching and I’m glad I persevered. I struggled though with the author’s writing style. Specifically I found myself stumbling on what I perceived as a persistently odd use of personification.
 I had been hearing a lot about this book for a while when my English teacher announced that we would be reading it in class. I was excited, and am glad now be able to say that this book lived up to my expectations and more. First and foremost, this book's language was fine, precise, and had such a flow that, when I first read some of the sentences, I found myself saying them aloud just to hear their sound roll off my tongue. Also, the characters in this book were so loveable and so easy to identify with, that the reader soon becomes engrossed in their lives, as if they themselves were living it. Zusak's imagery is amazing! It is as if he paints a picture in front of you, filled with rich details and many colors. I found no fault in this book, so I shall give it one of my rare five out of five star ratings. I would recommend this book for 13 years of age and older. I encourage those of you who have not yet read it to go out and find this book in your closest book store or library. Happy reading!!
 The pressing question of our times is "Do we ever learn from history, or are we destined to repeat the same mistakes?"  Narrated by Death in Nazi Germany, the Book Thief invites us to glimpse a world of mind control through "words", the hypnotic effect of a dictator through repetition of words and lies until the people believe them. "Politically correct" speech is de rigueur and books are banned and burned to prevent "ideas" from infecting the populace.  The result: a descent into hell for the German people and especially for those they choose to scapegoat and persecute.  Are we really far from that reality today as our focus is more and more narrow with social media and worship of the "elite"? Do we critically examine how our thoughts are being directed by our leaders? Enter Liesel, Rudy, Max and the Hubermanns. The Book Thief shows us that the essence of being human is empathy. Humanity cries out for recognition and celebration. An allegory for all times.  What would we do?
 I really enjoyed reading this story. The story is told from the view point of Death who is fascinated with a tenacious survivor during World War II Germany. In the process of Liesel's brushes with Death, she also becomes a stealer of words. Books and words intrigue the girl who is left in the grips of poverty during the war. Death narrates her story and that of her friends and foster family.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the poignant details of the heroine and of the secondary characters set in world of hopelessness and fear. It reminded me that even in terrible strife, there can be beauty and love; tenderness and compassion. I would highly recommend this book. I did not see the movie, because I would prefer the written word than that portrayed on the big screen. Like Liesel, books hold my heart.
 At first the narrative portion of the book confused me until I figured out who was doing the narration and then it was intriguing the way Mr. Zusak wove the narration in and out of the story. I have rarely found a book that details the lives of the German civilians during WWII. Those that I did find don't describe the official brainwashing that transpired at all levels of German society. What was also fascinating was how Mr. Zusak took our anti-heroine and made her into a true heroine who put her love for a child before the party her husband served. Leisel and Rudy were children whose childhoods were stolen but they stole their minds back. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and highly recommend it. I know it has been made into a movie and I am torn whether to see the movie for fear they will distort the book.
 I was in love by the first page. Zusak's writing is outstanding and colorful and brilliant. He is a word smith in The Book Thief and he paints the most beautiful picture of a troubled life on a young girl living in Nazi Germany. It is beautiful in it's heartbreak and within the hope that lies within the pages. It is perfect. The plot twists and turns and carried me to places I never expected. The characters are so well thought out that they seem real and that they could have been people who lived during this time. Each has his/her own flaws and their strengths and even secondary characters evolve throughout the book. People who you may not like in the beginning, you will love by the end and vise versa. There are no holes, no criticisms, and no reason to not plunge in head first into this novel. You will see the bad, the good and all the places in between within the pages of this book. It is exceptional. It is beautiful. It will stay with you for many days after you've read it.
 The power of words:  Nazi, Jew, hate, fear, friendship, love.  In The Book Thief, Liesel Meminger grows from an orphan girl who can't read to a young woman who understands all too well the ability of words to shape reality, whether the hateful propaganda of the Nazi regime or the shy, guilt-laden memories of a Jewish boy hiding in a basement.  But reality also shapes the words, making an insult, "Saumensch," into a term of endearment, and taking the fear from "Jew" and transforming it into friendship.<br/><br/>The story itself is both sad and hopeful.  War is war, and good people do not always come to good ends, but there is some solace in the thought that Death, as the narrator, recognizes the value of these souls and carries their stories with him long after their tales have ended.  This sometimes creates a strange sense that the author is de-emphasizing the atrocities of WWII, but this also contributes to the hope that evil fades and good endures.  It is, of course, more complicated than this as Death itself conveys at the end:<br/><br/>"I am haunted by humans."
 The story of the book thief has called to the writer and word lover in me, but has also caused me to have great pause as to what my writings can and cannot share with the world. I have the remembrances of a another who survived the hell of Dachau, but he never said anything about it to me. Except that he showed me the numbers on his arm and silently covered them again with his shirt sleeve. I know my parents have been there (to Germany land to Dachau), and that my mother's memory brings about nightmares. My papa (grandfather) fought against the tyranny on both sides of the world during the second world war, but I was not allowed to speak about it with him. Would my words make much difference? Doubtful. But for those whose words may never be seen or read or loved by another? I would give my words and my heart.
 This novel is about Liesel, an illiterate girl who loses her family and is raised by foster parents in a German town.  Her foster father, whom she calls Papa, teaches her to read in the wee hours of the morning when Liesel awakens from nightmares.  The highlights of the book for me were Liesel's relationships with a Jewish man harbored in the basement of her foster parents' home, Rudy who is a classmate and neighbor and a Nazi woman whose husband is the mayor.<br/><br/>The character development was excellent.  I felt like I knew so many of the people.  It is well written and I think it would appeal to teens and young adults.<br/><br/>I would have given this book 5 stars, but I didn't like having the book narrated by Death.  I know many like this, but to me it seemed like a gimmick.  It could have been told by Liesel.  In addition, Death would tell us what was going to happen in the future long before the actual events. That said, I did enjoy some of Death's prose toward the end of the book.
 Such a different perspective.  The narrative by Death as he snatches up the souls and yet the story is told through the eyes of a young girl.  Beautiful language and expression.  The courage and kindness of the human spirit as well as the cruelty through one of the worst times of history is both uplifting and heartbreaking.  I would recommend this book for young adult as well as anyone else. So important that the horrors are told in such a way that young people as well can read it.  They need to feel the fear of the times and how important words are.  How they can be salvation or cut like a blade.  I have read several books about the horrors of t his was, but none from the perspective of a young German girl.  Amazing.  One of  the best books I've read and one of the most haunting.  Hard to believe it is fiction because we know the subject well enough to know the true version of this book played out many thousands of times.  Was amazed to find that the author was so young.  Wonderful work.
 Every human needs to read this book. It is about Life. Beauty. Joy. Horror. Fear. Pain. Most of all, The Book Thief is about LOVE. If I were still a teacher of middle schoolers on up, I would read this book to my students and we would cry together and be bonded in our common humanity forever.
 This is a book with a great deal of heart and soul, and not to be missed by anyone who has empathy for those who were dispossessed during the time of WW2. The main narrator is Death himself, but here we meet Death with a more human face, in that he takes an interest in our main character, a living human girl, who loves to read, and steals a few books along the course of her young life. This was an unusual experience for me, in that I saw the movie first, and read the book second. Well, I LOVED the movie, and I had been recommended the the book by several avid readers, so I knew I would love it. It certainly did dovetail nicely with my Jewish studies. If you love to read, this is a book that's not to be missed. It has all the elements of a great read.
 This was a very original book about a very horrific time.  It is written in such a way as to resonate with readers from teenagers on up.  To the over 70 reader such as myself, it is very  appealing because of its very few  cuss words and lack of sex.  How refreshing that the author does not try to keep our attention with the lowest common denominator.  But the life of the girl is heartbreaking.  How many hearts were broken in that insane time of Nazi Germany.  My generation continues to be haunted by World War II.  Its memory will not die with those who lived it, because we the children inherited their losses, lived our lives without one or both parents, whether German, French, American, Japanese, or any of the many nationalities involved.  We were uprooted from our times, our culture, and life would never be the same.  The author very effectively describes this through the story of Liesel.  The use of Death as the narrator is very effective and we learn He has a sense of humor at times as well as a heart.  The acts of kindness of some people towards the girl and towards their Jewish boarder tells us there is indeed something greater than ourselves.<br/><br/>I expect The Book Thief to become one of the world's greatest Classics.
 It took me a few pages before I got into The Book Thief but once I realized who or what was narrating this haunting story, everything fell into place and I realized what a powerful device the author had found to tell this story. I was alive at the time events happened, although far from Nazi Germany, the setting for this improbable, yet possible, account of events both real and imagined, and I remembered hearing the sanitized version of events released to the world. The  Book Thief delves into the deprived reality of a country at war, the reactions of citizens fearful of retaliation if they disagreed publicly with Hitler's edicts, the tragedy and apparently fickle choice of who would live and who would die, the triumph of good over evil -- and occasionally vice versa.<br/><br/>It's all here, from Kristallnacht to the Battle of Stalingrad, from the furious rantings of a psychotic leader to the gentle goodness of the book thief, a precocious girl who finds solace and guidance in words. This book is unforgettable; a review can only touch on a few of its multiple layers. You'll have to read it for yourself -- even if you have tonsteal it!
 To be quite truthful I did not like the beginning of this book.  I just could not get into it.  A friend had lent it to me and I returned it to her unread except for the first fifty pages.  Before returning it I downloaded it to my  Kindle thinking that I might try reading again someday.  That evening I picked up my Kindle from where I left off and could not put it down until I only had fifty pages left to read.<br/><br/>It is amazing book.  The story is about a girl, her family and friends in  Germany during the war.  The girl couldn't read or write when she arrived at her foster parents and how her new Papa taught her to read and write.  She was very poor and because of her love of books she began to steal them and became as she called herself The Book Thief.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book to all.  Just remember if you decide to read it to keep going it gets better and better.
 This is one of those books. I've had this book sitting in my library for a long time. I just never got around to reading it. I'm sorry I waited so long. This book was very well written and from the most unusual view points. Both by the narrator and the background. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed reading this book.
 I am wiping tears from my face as I write this. I have just completed The Book Thief and wanted to give my thoughts while still fresh. Have you ever read a book that is nothing that you have ever read before? This is me. The Book Thief is told by the Grim Reaper. This is a different kind of storyteller, from what I'm used to. The lives of German people (  not Jewish)  during World War 2 , is a story I have wondered about. They had their own feelings about the war, Hitler, sacrifices they had to make. I found this book, not only interesting, but compelling! I would recommend this book to anyone interested in people living with war outside their windows and the different shades of love.
 I really loved this book.  It is about a girl growing up in Germany during WWII...she comes to live with a foster family and struggles to read.  Her foster father spends hours and hours with her in the middle of the night as she wakes up from nightmares of her dying brother and he eventually teaches her how to read.  The words and ideas keep her alive during a very hard period in history.<br/><br/>I really loved the main characters Liesel, Rudy, Rosa, Hans and Max...and The Mayor's wife, Frau Hermann-<br/><br/>I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because although it was interesting to hear the story told by "death" It also makes it harder to read.<br/><br/>It is disorganized and the book could have easily been 100-200 pages shorter and told the same story.<br/><br/>The book was marketed to Young Adults but I think it would be a very challenging book for that age group.<br/><br/>I recommend reading it when you have time to really devote a couple days to a book!
 This is one time that I saw the movie first and read the book later. I was on flight from London to Hyderabad and chose to watch the film. By the end of the movie, I clamped my hands on my mouth tightly, so the gentleman sleeping peacefully in the seat next to me cannot hear my loud sobs. I bought the book immediately and also recommended to my book club.<br/><br/>By the end of the book, I was crying again. While many may view this book as a tragic one, for me, it is a story with many life lessons. One thing is that war has no good guys and bad guys. Everyone suffers in a war, even the bad guys. There is always goodness in human beings. Like the narrator says there is beauty and brutality, too. This world needs to focus on the beauty of human beings, rather than the brutality. I know it is easier said than done, but there is no harm in trying, right?<br/><br/>This book is for one will gaunt you, forever.
 Astonishment that Death is the narrator...we miss, entirely, a most wondrous part of reality. That Death loves us, as much as we love Life. That Death cares for us, and preserves the stories that each one of us are, forever. And Death shares this remarkable story of a girl who is smitten with the beauty of words, the wonder of books...astonishing...
 The Book Thief, A New York Times bestseller, is an extraordinary novel about the holocaust from the point of view of Death (or the death angel, I prefer) narrator of the story. At the beginning a young girl, Liesel Meminger, is taken to a foster home outside of Munich. It's 1939 and persecution of the Jews is ongoing. Zusak writes beautifully, hauntingly, and convincingly bringing the characters and this time in history to life. Each individual is real and unique. The relationship between Liesel and her step father is a true parenting love story. Similarly, Liesel's friendship and companion in book thievery, Rudy, shows their childlike playfulness in spite of circumstances. The holocaust reality, though disturbing, helps us learn about that time. We must remember it and not let anyone deny it happened. There is humor; there is love and caring, all in the midst of tragedy. This is one of the best novels I've ever read.
 This one was exceptional.  I have never read a Holocaust book from the German people's perspective and this one was so unique.  It was beautifully written to start with and told such a sensitive story.  I was waiting for all the gory details but they were not told in the usual way.  You knew the horror was there but they were not the main point of the story. It was a warm and loving story about a young German girl growing up in Nazi Germany.  It wasn't Ann Frank's story but it was similar in the sense that it was told from a young girl's perspective -- no ideology, no hate, no apologies just acceptance of what her life was like and finding joy in that unholy time and place where she lived.  The most unusual aspect of the book was that it was narrated by Death who saw and absorbed all aspects of this horrific time.  I absolutely loved the book and am so glad I read it rather than seeing the movie which could not in any way come close to relating such a touching story.  I recommend it highly to anyone who has not thought about this era recently -- it is food for much thought particularly since there is so much war and killing going on now in the world.
 I had been told about this book ages ago. I put off reading it while I finished up other projects. I am SO glad I read this book. I loved it!! The realization that the narrator was Death was incredible. A character that should be distant and unemotional yet his story, told from inside the Holocaust,  showed love, bravery, innocence, and human decency. I can say I was warned about tragedy several chapters in advance, I still cried my face off. Cheers Mr. Zusak, it was a beautiful ride.
 I was so amazed by this book compared to the youthful look of its author's picture,<br/>I had to GOOGLE him on U-Tube to convince myself that someone in their early 30's was capable of his insight and wisdom. The unique idea to have Death narrarate this story and then having that Death fear humans, just took my breath away.  Yet he spins the tale in such a marvelous way that it is all believable...more than that...TRUTHFUL...the reader cannot help but give this idea some plausable thought.  Whether  you are a young adult or an OLD adult, this book is a must read in holocaust literature.  We all need to realize Markus' major premise that human beings are a confusing mixture of good and bad...capable of either in a given set of circumstances.  I had just finished And the Mountains Echoed by Hosseini and it seems that this truth is universal and holds in all geographic locations and in all generations.  What an amazing read.
 I just finished reading this book, and it is glorious.  I wasn't involved right away, but after a few pages, I was engrossed.  The book is very easy to read, despite the serious subject matter.  The details Zusak reveals and highlights, the way he tells the story demonstrates his masterful skill as a storyteller.  Story is narrated by Death, who reveals his fascination with a young girl named Liesel Meminger, who steals a book at her brother's funeral.  She is being sent to live with foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann in Nazi Germany.  Each parent is beautifully sketched, and I especially love the details of the neighbors.  Liesel is an engaging character, as is her best friend, Rudy Steiner.  There were parts that made me breathless, especially the parts of one's ferocious desire to live, the depth of love and devastation of loss, the intimacy of friends, the slow madness of the confined.  Here are people, who did not ask for war, it was forced on them, and they coped the best they could.  It's a beautiful story, which has longevity.  I highly recommend this book.
 The theme of how powerful words, imagination, and memory can be in the direst of circumstances has been communicated many times before. Still, it was executed very well in this book. I also found that this book adeptly explored the horrendous theft of innocence suffered by the German youth during World War II. While demonstrating that some of the German youth allowed themselves to be completely brainwashed by the Nazi Regime, this book dealt with the subject of Germans (including many children) who did not adopt the Nazis' hateful principles. It is important to remember that not all Germans were Nazis. Some Germans risked their lives to resist the Nazi Regime and its genocidal programs. Yet, fire bombs do not discriminate between the good people and the evil.This book demonstrated that suffering and Death came for all people (especially the innocent) during WWII. Yet, even while suffering and Death seem to reign supreme, individuals can find ways to go on. I believe that the ideas discussed in this book are very important for audiences of all walks of life, even if they have been explored before.
 I loved this book and plan to read it again, not only for the searing yet hopeful plot but also for the beautifully creative prose. Liesel, the book thief, loves words and understands their power. It's fitting, then, that the author describes spoken words in the story as if they are real objects. They drip down the walls, they clatter onto the kitchen table where everyone stares at them... Lovely, terse, poetic, richly layered with multiple subtexts. This is what a book ought to be. The only metaphor I didn't get was the "sky the color of breakfast." What color exactly is that? hmm
 This was an interesting book. I am 23 so I guess I would still be considered a young adult, but this booked lacked the childish narration that is sometimes present in some of the typical "young adult" novels. I had just finished Unbroken which was another amazing WW2 story of survival and going right into this one, I felt almost totally immersed. The narrator is Death, which I'm sure you have realized is a very unique point of view. I LOVED how this book was written however. I loved the images that I got from it, the almost gothic feel to some of the scenes and I LOVED how real the characters are. They are people in every sense of the word and I really feel like I really got to know them throughout the book. After finishing I just can't stop thinking about the characters. About life and how strange it is the way things turn out sometimes. I loved the imagination of the author in taking this spin on things and I keep looking for people to recommend this book to. I got the Kindle version but I'm thinking about getting a paperback version also so I can pass it around to family, friends and coworkers. The night I finished this book I had tears running down my face and I was haunted by it as I tried to go to sleep that night. I know I will read it again.
 The story of the book thief was poignant, but events in the book and the effects on German citizens were nothing terribly unusual in WWII Nazi Germany.  Much of the book thief's personal story could have been told in another time and setting and still been well worth reading.<br/><br/>What makes this book terrific is the narrator.  I'm speaking about Death.  Death tells the tale like no human character ever could.  I loved that Death was empathetic, curious, and interested in the souls he/she? rescues from their lifeless bodies.  He carefully carries the children's souls in his arms.  He is not without his charms.  He is not offended, but rather amused, at being called the Grim Reaper.  He doesn't feel grim.  He is simply doing his job...his endless job.  He doesn't mind when souls are held back from him by a will to live.  He knows he will return for them all eventually.  He is tender, above all else.<br/><br/>A lovely work.
 I love this book.  While I have read and studied WWII Germany from both the Nazi written side and the Jewish written side, I never imagined it from the "Death" side. This book is so well written that I found it almost impossible to put down. As "The Diary of Anne Frank" was required reading in school, this book should be too.  I think many people overlook that many non-Jewish people in Germany, were more or less forced to support the Nazi dictatorship for survival or were punished. It is enlightening to see what they endured during the time leading up to Hitler's empowerment and during his reign and how their lives were impacted by Hitler's defeat.  Maybe people will realize that whether it is Germany in WWII or war in today's Iraq, there are innocent people on both sides suffering. The only winner in any war really seems to be death. Death trumps religions, boundries, greed, etc.
 I am a retired police officer from an inner city.  A city that has all the ills of most inner cities today.  I have seen my share of tragedy, wasted lives and certainly needless death.  I comforted the survivors and hunted down the guilty.<br/><br/>Believe me when I tell you that you never leave those memories behind.  Those ghosts hide in your minds rafters and constantly shiver and simmer just waiting to fall out with slightest bit of help form currant daily tragedies.<br/><br/>But over time you kid your self that you've toughened up. Emotions don't hurt so much and other things just aren't as funny or as much fun anymore.<br/><br/>However, this book shook all those ghosts and demons right out of those cranial hide aways and brought those stomach rendering bastards face front .<br/><br/>Without shame I  admit that tears flowed down my cheeks as I read this book. Never thought of death as a partner or as an entity that could care one way or another. Never gave Nazies much thought as people with  redeemable souls. This is an  opportunity to  see and hear the HOLOCAUST from a different perspective.<br/><br/>The word crafting is on par with Hemingway ,Faulkner,and any other of the great story tellers.<br/><br/>I would give this author ten stars if possible.**********
 A truly unforgettable, astonishingly touching book that is written with the kind of beautiful imagery and play of words that we usually only find in poetry or in books like "Beloved." It's a great example of why we love to read. I read somewhere that it may be based on the author's own grandmother's childhood in Nazi Germany. Whether that's true or not, it's a good reminder that not every German in Nazi Germany was a heartfelt Nazi. I didn't realize until I had finished reading the book that its supposed intended audience is "young adults." I found that a bit of a shock, because I think this is a wonderful book for all ages - STARTING, perhaps, at 13 or so - but for everyone after that. In some ways, it can be compared to "A Tree Grows In Brooklyn" for its richness of characters and the beauty that can surround the simplest and most common (or uncommon) human relationships. Others here have given detailed glowing reviews of this book that I don't believe I can improve upon, so just read those. I am extremely grateful to the author for having made this wonderful book available via a Kindle download, although I will also be buying a hard copy for my granddaughter. Highly recommended!<br/><br/>P.S. I want to add that the Kindle edition did include the few essential illustrations that are in the hardcover edition.
 This is the story of a little girl whose daddy is sent away for being a Communist, and God only knows what fate awaits her mother.  She ends up in a foster home outside Munich. her only remaining kin a brother who died on the journey.  Surprisingly, the narrator is Death, a not unpleasant fellow who sees everything, complains when the work is to onerous, and saves time to consider the children.  The occasional glimpses of prisoners are fleeting, but the passage of day after day through the war's trials is, as it must have seen to these ordinary folks, unendingly dull,livened only by the mischief of the young people.  This is far from a children's story and is has its own fascination.  On the other hand, I think it would prove interesting to someone in Senior High School.
 I can only tell you that this book spoke to my heart.  This is one of those books where you completely, and I mean COMPLETELY, lose yourself in the story.  You won't hear your name being called and the book should probably come with a health warning because you will skip both meals and sleep to keep reading this story.  I believe everything in this book-the characters, the times and the lives, all touch on aspects of each of our lives today.  There are plenty of reviews describing the story to you-I just want you to read it for your self, you will be so glad you did.<br/>This book is for everyone, both youth and adults.  I haven't been a young adult for some time but I loved every page.  I both want to see the movie and re-read this wonderful story.  This is a keeper!:D<br/><br/>HIGJLY RECOMMEND!!! :D  :)
 Narrated by Death, this story takes us through the tragic life of young Liesel Meminger. Relinquished by her mother into Germany's foster care system, she moves to a new city, a new family, and it is here, in a suburb of Munich, that she deals with the new realities that come with growing up in Hitler's Germany.<br/><br/>The story is mostly told from her perspective, or how Death saw her story through her eyes, but with outside glimpses of what was happening to others in her life. The characters change remarkably through the years of the war, but keep true to the values they began with.<br/><br/>The only thing that makes this book less powerful is that Death does a lot of foreshadowing to lessen the blow of things to come. (He directly states this at one point in the text.) I understand that this is a piece of juvenile literature, but the ending would have been much more powerful had the reader not been told exactly what was coming 100 pages prior.
 I did not love this book, but I was intrigued and kept reading. I thought the characters were unusual and it was interesting to see Hitler's rise to power through the eyes of Germans who did not necessarily have strong political beliefs but complied with the Nazis more for convenience. They weren't heros but they weren't evil, either.<br/>It is harsh- there is very little kindness in the book. I winced as I read it. But I guess that should not be surprising considering the setting.<br/>Death is a character. I found it's voice to be imaginative, but less profound than I wished. Perhaps that is part of the point- death is not  profound, it is just all in a day's work.<br/>I feel that I lost some of the book's features through reading it on the Kindle. I think some of the storytelling is conveyed through how the words are laid out on the page. If I had been reading it in paper form, I think I would have flipped back to the chapter headings as I worked my way through to help be grasp more nuance. But I find flipping cumbersome on the Kindle so i just kept pushing forward.
 I went into this book "blind" - I had no idea what it was about - I was just reading it as a book club selection.  My initial reaction was shock that this somewhat "brutal" book was a Young Adult book -- I think it might be too harsh for many teens. This is why I held back one star.<br/><br/>That said, it was interesting. The narrative is done in a way that might take some getting used to  -- at first it annoyed me, but, shortly, I got into the swing of things. There are a lot of Holocaust stories out there, starting with the Diary of Ann Frank, but this takes a different tack, a different point of view.<br/><br/>In the end, I was glad to have read it, to have stuck with it to the end.  I would recommend it to people who are interested in this kind of reading. As a matter of fact, if it is just the title that attracts you, then you will probably enjoy it.  When all is said and done, though, I don't think I will read anything more by this author.
 I bought this book after I saw the movie. It was a tear jerker of a movie, but even more important, it was a tear jerker of a book.  At the end, where death takes Hans, Rosa, and Rudy, one has to doubt the sanity of the world.  Leisal suffered, but in the end the suffering made her stronger. I thought the Canadian actress who played her in the movie was good.  She was spot on with the novel.<br/><br/>At the end, a moral which is that humanity always has the ability to surprise us-for the good and bad.  Millions die because of a man's hatred of a religion.  One girl survives because of the goodness of people.  Humanity certainly has the ability to surprise everyone including death.<br/><br/>This is nice read about man's inhumanity to man.
 I had never heard of this book until I saw the movie trailer on TV.  The trailer looked interesting so I downloaded the book from Amazon on my Kindle and bought an additional hard copy for my mom for christmas since she said she was also interested in reading it.<br/><br/>I was determined to finish one book over my christmas vacation and I picked this one.  I spent several hours on the couch absorbed in reading this book.  The story line is unique and you honestly care about the characters in the book.<br/><br/>I thought the beginning was a little odd when the narrator were talking about the different colors, but eventually I began to understand what all that was about as I read more.  The narrator hints to events to come, but when they do happen you sometimes arent really emotionally prepared for some of them.<br/><br/>In the end the book was a tear jerker, but it was still a satisfying read.
 The young protagonist of the book says this: "I have hated the words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right."  I'm sure I can not make the words "right" and do this book justice in a review.  It's just that good.<br/><br/>This is a story, narrated by Death, about a young girl in Germany during World War II.  I understand this is a YA book, but it is enjoyable for adults.<br/><br/>Zusaks' prose was amazing.  I've highlighted many quotes.  The book is like an onion.  There are so many layers and it's likely to make you cry.  The layers are amazing.  There is a lot of depth to the book and a lot going on with characters and plot.  I thought it was really interesting how Death would tell us something about what was to come, but just a small snippet.  Then when the time arrived, it was like a distant memory or a sense of déjà vu in that I kind of knew what was about to happen on a larger scale but the details were about to be filled in.<br/><br/>I truly felt for the characters.  They were extremely well developed.  Liesel is an amazing protagonist.  I adored her and then with her, I laughed, cried, got angry, and was fearful. She nearly came to life for me.  Hans and Rosa are also worth mentioning as well written characters.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful book.
 A girl who haunts death, intriguing, masterful concept in narration. Zusak tells a story of the many loves of one girl coming of age in Hitler's Germany. Death follows her like a creepy uncle, but ultimately finds her survival and ability to find comfort in words too much for even death to overcome.
 I generally avoid books about World War II because I know they are going to be sad and leave me depressed.  But after promising a friend I'd read this book I must say it was really good.  Yes it is definitely sad, but the way it is written with Death as the narrator is not only unique but Death is very matter of fact and gives the reader clues to the end of the story (if not actual parts of the end) throughout the book to kind of brace you for everything that's going to happen.  It's an inspiring story that does have an overall uplifting ending and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading something different.  Though there are many World War II stories out there this one stands out not just from who the narrator is but who the characters are.  It focuses on a non-Jewish German family trying to hold to their morals and while still surviving in Nazi Germany.
 This is very unique and fascinating read! With Death as the narrator, this is a novel exposition of the meaning of "Memento Mori!"<br/><br/>The structure of the book, the spoiler headings of each chapter, the character development, the driving narrative, the terror of war and genocide, the human nature of love, prejudice, growth and death, the wry humor - all interwoven in a masterful prose. The use of metaphor and simile is delicious, running on and developing for several phrases, provoking and catching one's attention.<br/><br/>There are a few books I have not wanted to end because I would miss the characters, who have become like family or dear friends (Ursula Hegi's "Stones from the River", also set in the Nazi era, was another). I am recommending this book to everyone!
 In Germany, during World War II, a young girl named Liesel is taken in by an unusual family who also takes in a Jew and hides him in their basement. Liesel deals with death and loss at the beginning of the novel when her brother dies and her mother leaves her with the foster family. The narrator, death, recounts the circumstances involving each book that she steals and the relationships with her adopted Papa, his wife, and the Jewish man that hides in the basement. Through the narrator's eyes, the reader also witnesses Liesel's relationships to a boy named Rudy, her best friend from the neighborhood, and a woman whose library she visits, stealing another book with each visit. Her relationships to the characters in the novel are filled with love and loss, and the narrator's commentary adds a unique angle. He seems to be fascinated with the girl and even odder, he seems to have compassion for the people whose souls he takes. The author, Markus Zusak, has created a novel that reads like poetry, filled with horror and beauty. The language is colorful, pun intended, touching and often satirical.  Death, loss, war, genocide, compassion, forgiveness, love, the nature of the soul, the nature of evil, censorship and book burning are all explored in this novel. Since the book deals with war, genocide and death it may be difficult for some young adults to read, but it is well-worth it.
 Fantastic book.  A friend loaned me her book and I read and fell in love with this story.<br/>I watched the movie with my family (2 songs, ages 9 and 13) and they suggested we read the book together.<br/>This copy was purchased for our home library for this purchase.  It should be on the shelf of every home library - fantastic book!
 Tonight, I finished reading Marcus Zusak's The Book Thief -- a major Hollywood movie released last year was based on this novel. Set in Nazi Germany, during World War II, the story is told from the perspective of Death, the one who gathers the troubled souls departing this world and takes them away from the realm of physical existence.<br/><br/>Liesle, the principal character in the novel, is introduced to us on a train where her little brother is dying from tuberculosis. Her mother, desperate that her daughter may live is taking her to find another family as she is too shattered in her life to continue raising her. At a remote station, Liesle's little brother dies and is buried in the town cemetery, a location to which neither she nor her mother have any connection, until this burial. It is at this cemetery that Liesle steals her first book, from a young boy, the caretaker's apprentice -- The Gravedigger's Handbook. She cannot read it yet, yet Liesle feels the power that words hold for her, and feels compelled to keep it when she notices the young apprentice drop it.<br/><br/>Liesle ends up being raised by a poor family in a suburb of Munich, as National Socialism comes to power under der Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler. Slowly, life begins to unravel, as yellow stars begin appearing in Jewish neighborhoods just blocks from her house. Persecution intensifies until processions of Jewish "laborers" are marched through the streets on their way to Dachau, the local concentration camp.<br/><br/>Liesle's family ends up hiding a Jewish young man in their basement, despite terrible risks, as her adopted father was befriended by the young man's father in World War I. Although forced to join the Nazi Party in order to feed his family, he has no sympathy for the Reich and its racist aims. Exhibiting great bravery, Liesle's "Papa" dares to give a dry crust of bread to a staggering old man, being forced on the march through town to Dachau -- and receives a savage beating for his trouble.<br/><br/>Liesle continues to find solace in books, belonging to the wife of the town Mayor, who allows her to "steal" books from her library and read them to neighbors, even during frightening air raids which threaten their community. She discovers the power of Words to cast vision, inform, make sense of life, and ennoble the human spirit.<br/><br/>In a poignant moment, following a direct hit by allied bombers of her street, killing absolutely everyone who is precious to her, she finds her "voice" through writing, becoming the "word shaker" who climbs the tree of ideas to shake down its fruit to pass on the truth that is hidden in her heart.<br/><br/>This is a most sobering book, riveting because of the beauty of the human spirit which is distilled through unspeakable tragedy, suffering and loss. It is a reminder that truth cannot be suppressed by propaganda forever, but will find its expression through honest hearts unafraid to give it voice and pen.
 This is a book that drew me in right from the start.  Taking place as it does in a world controlled by the Nazi's, it opened a window to the place and time that was just a bit different from the norm.  Yet, can anyone truly say that anything was the norm?  I  could easily relate to the main character's love of books, but occasionally wanted to yell at her to do this or that differently.  I could make the easy choices with a full belly and a secure roof over my head.  What would I have done in her shoes?  I really don't know  for which I am very thankful!]  This book made me think in ways most do not.  It wasn't always the most comfortable or easy book to read, but it made me stretch and grow in ways few stories do.  Were I still teaching, I<br/> would happily pair this book with Anne Frank.
 I honestly don't know what to add to all of the reviews that have already extolled the virtues of this book, other than another data point saying how truly exceptional it is.<br/><br/>A tragic tale set during WWII and narrated by Death, the premise sounds as bleak as it gets, so the humor the tale is told with really surprised me. Now, that's not to say that this is a comedy. The subject matter is serious, and at no point is suffering made the butt of a cheap joke. Rather, the material is handled with a light touch that keeps the reader engaged with the personal narrative unfolding against the larger backdrop and offers the opportunity for insightful commentary on human nature that couldn't be delivered as effectively any other way. The result is that the tone is profoundly humane rather than irreverent, and all the more moving for it. Don't pass this one up, it's absolutely worth the read.
 Don't expect an off into the sunset ending or a lot of twists and turns, but the characters and the imagery really sink their teeth in you and don't let go. There were times I just wanted to "pause" the story to relish these beautiful moments of humanity during such ugly times.  I also wanted to stop what I knew was probably going to happen from happening.<br/><br/>The characters are complex and interesting. I love that death is a sympathetic character / narrator who's afraid of humans. The seeming ease with the way Zusak whittles and plays with words is inspiring.<br/><br/>The circumstances, side stories, and characters really rang true for me as there were so many parallels with first-hand stories I've heard from that time period.  My father-in-law is from Germany and was a teen during the Nazi regime.  His tales of coping in the Nazi Youth, and evading capture from the Russians are captivating.  He actually escaped Russian capture and returned to Berlin to find his home destroyed.  Fortunately, after asking around, he learned that his family was safe.  As I was reading this book, I pictured him as Rudy, as he shares much of Rudy's energy and optimism.  I also stayed a summer in college with a beautiful woman from Britain who was in London during the war and the book brought back many of her stories of the bomb raids and the chaos of the war.<br/><br/>I love that Zusak writes for himself without worrying about what will be published, it creates a raw authenticity that I think has become more and more difficult to find.  It just feels so real and beautifully human.  As an aspiring writer, he's motivated me to find more time to put the pen to paper!  Zusak, thank you for opening yourself up in this way!
 I should start by saying that I loved the POV this book was written in. I was surprised by it when I first started reading but then as I thought about it, I thought it made perfect sense. At times throughout the story I was enthralled and sometimes dismayed by the writing. When blood is represented by cherries and plums you find it more palatable and yet you know nothing about this book should be palatable. The characters felt endearing and real and you know with each little eccentricity revealed you will become more attached and therefore wrenched as you know this is not a happy book about candy and smiles although there were both in the story. Overall, I think I experience what I'm sure the writer intended me to experience although at times I had to be urged onward much like the characters.  At the end, I feel wrung out, happy and sad all at once and glad for the experience.
 I can't remember the last time I cried while reading a book, but there was a part of this book that grabbed me and tore at my emotions.  Wow.  I can't believe I'm going to publish this.  But it's an absolutely amazing book and I need to give the author credit for thoroughly capturing me in the lives of the characters.  There is a good reason why it's already in our schools and on suggested reading lists.  Great, captivating story.  It's long, so you won't rush through it.  Certainly, if you don't like historical novels set in Nazi Germany, you do not want to read this.  However, the greater part of this book is about individuals and their relationships and struggles.  There was also a uniqueness about this book that put it in a place by itself.
 Mr. Zusak is a "word genius" to use the book vernacular and this book is a must read for "word lovers" and bibliophiles. The author takes a story about Nazi Germany, the atrocities towards Jews, and World War II and makes it beautiful, haunting, funny, and entertaining while simultaneously weaving serious philosphical questions about the state of being human throughout. His approach is unique, creative, thoughtful, and touching. This is story telling at its very best. I listened to the book while driving 150 miles per day for my work commute and the time flew by while I simultaneously marveled at the story and the writer's craft. But those who are tender- hearted should beware:  I was forced to pull off the road for the last chapter. I could not drive because of the tears in my eyes.
 Many well qualified readers have enthused about this book, and the recent film has won acclaim too.  As a retired librarian, the title attracted me before I was aware of the excellent reviews, and reading the book has been a great joy.  The spirit of the little girl who had so many upheavals and abandonment to deal with, the description of her growing awe of books, and the amazing care she received from her foster parents are all incredible.  The author provides an interesting new slant on World War II, from the German citizens' perspective, not a common approach in the English speaking literature.  This book should be compulsory reading for any dictator who is considering any sort of warlike activity!  Altogether, it has been a treat to read, and I'll be able to reread it many times in the future with just as much pleasure as I find new nuances in the text.
 I had read the first chapter at the urging of my brother, who was reading it for school. He had to give the book back and I was hooked so I ordered it here. I read it cover to cover in a day. I couldn't put it down.<br/>It has this stunning and haunting beauty about it, which reminded me of "The Virgin Suicides" by G. Eugenides. This isn't really a spoiler, because you generally assume a book about WWII Germany is going to be depressing in some capacity, but I cried like I've never cried when reading a book. I don't think I've ever cried so much for a sad event in my own life. I don't think I've ever had characters and imagery in a novel touch me in the way that this novel did.<br/>My advice: Read it. Cry. Curse the person who recommended this tale to you. Then add it to your favorites list. You will hate how much you love this book (or at least I did).
 Heart wrenching and tender the story takes place in Germany during the  blackest time in it's history.  it is an eye opener for anyone who hasn't imagined the horrors the German citizens either witnessed or experienced while the Nazi regime controlled their every move and tried to control their very thoughts.  Markus Zusaak is a brilliant writer who makes you feel that you are right there in the neighborhood without enough to eat, afraid of being noticed by the government to be taken away to fight in the army or watching the starving Jews being marched to the camps.  This is a book you don't want to put down and even when you are done reading it you cannot get it out of your thoughts.  I cried, laughed, felt sick at times, adored the characters and felt that I had just read the best history book ever.
 A powerful story of a young girl's difficult (to say the least!) life in WWII Germany.  I feel this book is particularly important now, as we have Nazi Holocaust deniers among us and the actual survivors of that terrible ordeal are passing away or are very old.  Another good reason to read this book is that the perspective of non-Jewish German citizens themselves can be glossed over or simply dismissed as their being "animals" who were afraid to speak up for what was right. Some were that brave, and paid a dear price for it, too. And the Nazis weren't animals, they were human! They were us, people, and it behooves us to reflect on what it was like to live in that society.<br/>Anyway, the story revolves around a young girl who has many trying times in her own life, including losing loved ones and having to cope with being a foster child.  Death narrates the story, fitting as he is on the scene quite a lot then.  He does a good job telling the tale not too morbidly and actually with even a little humour.<br/>An engaging story, I found myself not wanting it to end, or at least without too much suffering, but what do you expect when Death is the storyteller? Still an enjoyable read, I recommend it and think it's great for young and old.
 The Book Thief is a book for young adults about a child who faced the loss of her mother and the challenges of being raised by foster parents in Nazi Germany during World War II. The book's narrator is Death and provides a unique perspective and voice that is unique from many other books. This book is also told about a girl and those people who touched her life during her childhood. She is a unique heroine though in that she is a German child of the Nazi regime who has to process the conflicting feelings of being part of Hitler Youth while having a potentially questionable upbringing in the eyes of the Third Reich. It is a touching story that encourages you to fight for what you believe in and a great read for people of all ages.
 Mr. Zusak is a modern day genius of the written word. He could make the telling of a worm's journey across pavement interesting. I have seen the movie and read the book. The movie can do no justice to this man's brilliance. With death as the orator I found the voice to be hauntingly true to form. I felt as if a friend I had known for years simply sat next to me and recounted a truth they had held inside them for many years.<br/><br/>The nuance of good and evil, morality during the height of war, young love and the story that emanates from the pen of this author must certainly be considered an instantaneous classic. Read it, absorb it and drift away into the mind of a young woman who was robbed of everything except the written word and you will find yourself nothing short of inspired.
 Yes, this is a difficult read until you get the hang of it, &amp; no, it is not your typical holocost novel - it is rather, an extraordinary tale unraveling the horrors of Nazi Germany bit by bitter bit.  It reminds me of Ravel’s Bolero, starting quietly, innocuously, and building layer upon layer, day by frightening day until we reach the terrifying conclusion we know is coming.  Be prepared for a literary tour de force.
 I very seldom have the feeling after finishing a book that it was one of the best books I have ever read. The Book Thief is one of those books. It held my interest all the way through because the author has a very good command of the english language, knows how he wants to tell the story and develops rich, memorable characters. To have the story narrated by none other than Death! To have a very sweet young girl given away by her mother, and her last remembrance of her brother is his death in the snow. Liesel will latch onto your heart from the very beginning. Papa and Rosa, her foster parents, are struggling as it is but they accept Liesel into their home with love. Liesel endures love, remorse, fear, and war, and is able to endure all of this because Papa patiently taught her how to read. I cannot speak highly enough of Markus Zusak and his use of words that allows the reader to see, feel, touch, smell love, and cruelty. This book was written for high school students. Well, I am 70 years old and could not wait to turn to the next page. This book will be a treasure to anyone who reads it.
 "The Book Thief" is a very interesting book about a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany. The girl is forced to grow up very quickly when her brother dies and she is taken from her mother to live with a foster family on Himmel Street. Liesel is treated well by her foster parents and makes friends with a local boy, Rudy. However, the horrors of World War II make Himmel Street an increasingly scary place to be. Liesel assists her foster parents in hiding a young Jewish man in their basement. She also develops a love of books, and a habit of stealing them from a variety of places, ranging from Nazi-inflicted fires to the mayor's library.<br/><br/>This book is written in a very unique voice and is narrated by death, which is extremely cleverly done. I was surprised that this is considered a young adult book, as the material is definitely very adult in nature. Also, I did think the book dragged a bit in places, which is why I can't give it five stars. But "The Book Thief" is definitely a good book, and is worth your time.
 This is a beautifully written book about a very ugly time in history. The setting is Munich, Germany, from the rise of Hitler's power into WWII. It was an amazing story for me, and I found myself profoundly moved - partly because my mother and I went to Munich shortly after the war, to join my father, who had served in Europe during the war, and then been kept on in Munich. I was a baby, and German was my first language. I remember the bombed places, the rubble, and the gangs of children that roamed the streets looking for food. And this book gave me a view of what preceded  my own time there.<br/>The book looks at the complexity of human relationships, and the complexity of the individual. It is also an agonizingly painful look at war, and what war does to people, to society, to a country.<br/>The book brought many tears to my eyes, but I felt very grateful to the author for writing it.<br/>I highly recommend this book, and consider it to be a new classic.
 Could hardly put the book down. Such a unique approach. Very well written.<br/><br/>Although narrated by "Death," there was neither morbidity nor terror. I loved some of the unique narrator's perspective, especially when he commented, "I stepped on him on the way out"--(the framed picture of Hitler). Towards the end, Death says, "I carried him gently...with one salty eye and a heavy, deathly heart."<br/><br/>Appreciated the underlying philosophy when Death remarked, "His soul sat up. It met me. Those kind of souls always do--the best ones." Definitely grateful that in the middle of hate and ghastly prejudice, there were those who were willing to sacrifice their own lives, if necessary, to help another human being.<br/><br/>One warning: there is a significant amount of "German blasphemy,"(to use the same term as was used by "Death").
 Even though this book was released a few years back, many people recently recommended it and noted that it was one of their favorite books they'd read in awhile. While I liked the story, I didn't feel nearly as passionate about it as the people who had mentioned it to me did (or most of Amazon's reviewers, for that matter).<br/><br/>I certainly appreciate the premise that books can sometimes be saviors and loved the "feel good" nature of Leisel sharing her love of books with other characters (particularly her neighbors as they hid in the bomb shelters).<br/><br/>However, I think the book's structure was a detriment to Leisel's story. It begins with a huge section of the narrator's thoughts and him/her telling the readers about the three times he'd seen "the book thief" (i.e. Leisel). As I was reading it, it took me quite awhile to figure out who in the world the narrator was and, when I did, I was just perplexed. Why is the Angel of Death (or something like that...he/she is never explicitly mentioned by name) the narrator?? It just never made sense to me...even after I'd finished the book. I hated it so much that I thought if things didn't change fast, then I wasn't going to be able to keep reading.<br/><br/>Things got better when we got into Leisel's story, but the constant return (at the beginning of each "section" and in asides throughout the book) of the Angel narrator pulled me out of the story and just plain drove me nuts. Had the story of Leisel and her world been told in a straightforward way, I think I would have liked the book more, though I still doubt I would have loved it as much as others did.<br/><br/>For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves.
 This book doesn't need another review but here goes anyway--I struggled in the first 1/3 of the book to hang in there. I do not like the headlines from Death to be so compelling. In fact, it took me out of the action and I wish the author had left them out. The voice of Death as a narrator is another thing entirely--that I loved. And as the book went on, its power grew. Fantastic read. If you're like me and don't love the way Death comes off, keep going. It's worth it. Beautiful in the end.....
 I feel like this great work is something that could only ever come once in a lifetime.<br/>The Characters, the plot. Everything is perfect.<br/>Loved this book from start to finish and feel lucky to have found it. Instantly re-read a second time completely through it was so enjoyable.
 I am a student of the Holocaust.  I have read dozens of non-fiction and fiction books on the subject.  This book is unique among all of those writings.  Narrated by the personified character, "Death," focusing especially on the life of a young German girl, intertwining the unusual characters, achieving depth of characterization, varying the style of narrative, creating unanticipated twists and turns, and resulting in a mournful pathos in the conclusion -- all of these describe a book which is quite different than any novel or historical re-creation of the Holocaust.  I have not yet seen the movie based on this novel, but there is no real way to fully approximate the text on the big screen.  If you like to read fiction, and you are fascinated about a time in which people were forced to deal with exaggerated evil, you MUST read this book!
 Told from the POV of death this story of how Nazi Germany affects a young German girl. We see the kindness of a child and although her adoptive parents seem strict at first she quickly warms up to them and realizes that they are trying their best. I don't want to ruin anything. But I believe this should be a book that kids have to read in school. This is the book that made me learn to love reading.
 Amazing book, I can tell why it is popular for middle and high school curriculum. It explains WWII Germany from the perspective of a child and in such an amazingly incredible and unique way. I highly recommend this book! I don't read often but once I find a great book to get into it reignites my desire to read and this one did that!
 This was an interesting look at Germans, especially a young girl, and how they felt and dealt with living during Hitler’s war.  Certainly not all Germans were on board and many even sympathized with the Jews.  The writing style was different and at times I felt lost and confused. It eventually comes together, but I have to admit that I had to force myself to finish this book.
 Each Liesel, Max, Rudy, Hans or Rosa who lived in the Nazi Germany and suffered the horrors of the war get the chance to a new life in this book. The Book Thief is their way of seeing the sky and the clouds again, to listen to the accordion's music and to feel the dripping sun. Maybe their lives were too soon taken away by the author but when you relive their moments with so much reality they come back and I think they appreciate that world did not forget them.  Their memory is still alive.<br/>I was touched and impressed by the book, i like knowing everything about how people lived and breath and laugh and still lived their lives during the war. The book reminded me that the human race is the most dangerous one but also the most beautiful of them all.
 I loved this book. I loved this book so much and yet feel unable to find the words to say how much. Written from the POV of Death (who knew Death had synesthesia?) this book lifts you up even as it's breaking your heart. There are so many great lines in this book, "For me, the sky was the color of Jews." What a horrible, beautiful line. When I'd read the last line of the book, I sat on my couch crying for I don't know how long. I feel like weeping again, just writing this. I"m sorry I'm not very coherent in this review, but if you take away anything from this, it's READ THIS BOOK. I read it on my Kindle, but have ordered the hardcover version, I feel the need to hold it in my hands. That's how much I love this book.
 Once you get used to narrator being "death" very good read. End, although sad and maybe not satisfying for all, it does reflect life as it is (was) Evan if the reader would have it end with less tragically and not so under done at the end. Life is like that for most of us...a romantic flourish early on;  no happily ever after, just life ever after.  I saw somewhere that this was for young adults; not so.  Young protagonist, yes.  No sex.  But very adult depiction of Nazi Germany and the horrors that many suffered.  Death of family at the end very traumatic and not at all for young adults.  Some not so young adults would have trouble with story.  Good read on Kindle because has short bites that allow one to read in short bursts (I used my iPhone frequently while waiting for other things).
 I do NOT like reading about the Holocaust. Pulls too hard on my heart. But I read this book for a book club, and now it is one of my MOST FAVORITE books of all time!! This book cannot be over-recommended! The narrator grabbed my attention on the first page, and held it way after I had finished reading the book. Loved the symbolic use of colors and emotions. Recommended this book to my 14 year old daughter, and now it's one of her favorites as well. Would recommend this to ALL ages. Even younger children could get a lot out of this book if a parent read to them (and maybe answered questions about the war conditions as they came up.)<br/>Had to put 'some violence', it is, after all, during WW II. There are a few swear words, not many, but I don't care for swearing. However, they are in German, so it didn't mean anything to me!
 Amazing, stunning visuals painted with words. An unforgettable story of a young girl who has lived through tragedy, yet finds hope for a better life with poor, but loving foster parents in 1939 Germany. She longs to learn how to read, and forms a special bond with her papa, who teaches her in an unconventional way. He also teaches her about what it means to keep a promise. Wonderful story of Liesel, her friends, neighbors, life, and human dignity in Germany  during the years 1939 - 1946. It is, after all, a WWII story, and narrated by death, may not be for the faint hearted.
 The Book Thief is about a young girl trying to make sense of the insanity of World War II Germany.<br/><br/>Its crushing of innocence with senseless adult behavior reminds me of The Boy in Striped Pyjamas. Its chronicle-like characteristics are similar to Anne Frank. What makes The Book Thief stand apart is its empathy with ordinary German citizens suffering the consequences of war, particularly the misery it brought to the German nation towards its end.<br/><br/>Of course, there is the ever haunting Jewish perspective. Of course, the brutalization through Nazism is omnipresent. Of course, the courage of ordinary people is present.<br/><br/>Yet, The Book Thief is much more than all this. It is a moving tale of an ordinary German town coping with a horror they got swept into. It is a moving tale of a young child coping with this horror along with her family and friends.<br/><br/>A truly moving tale of a History we must learn from, lest we repeat it.
 If you haven't read this book or seen the movie adaptation I definitely recommend it. It's written from the perspective of Death about a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany. And if the phrase "written from the perspective of Death" doesn't spark your interest then I'm not sure what will! The author's writing style is a bit unconventional I would say, but in a delightfully refreshing way. I don't want to spoil anything but this is a seriously good book so go read it!
 I thought I had read enough books about Nazi Germany and didn't need the puffy eyes that accompany the horrendous cruelty, so I avoided The Book Thief even though it had been highly recommended.  I finally changed my mind and was rewarded by a completely unique reading experience.  It took a very short time to adjust to the quirky narrator's colorful style , but once that happened, I was in the world of the Book Thief and the characters that surrounded her.  If you have been unsure about reading The Book Thief,  you will not be disappointed.  Zusak writes like an enlightened human being who elevates the reader with characters who find beauty, joy and friendship in hopeless places.  It was wonderful!
 I don't usually read the books that (1) my wife recommends and (2) attract so much popularity.  Yet "The Book Thief", while satisfying both criteria, proved to be worthwhile for both the unique perspective of the narrative and the compelling story.  I was drawn into the world of pre-war and wartime Germany through the story of this young girl and her experiences.  How she found love and fulfillment in the most challenging of circumstances keeps you turning the pages.  The supporting characters are equally strong and evoke appropriate reactions as events unfold.  No "spoiler alert" here, but I recommend reading the book before your see the film.  Both are highly  satisfying in their own right.
 Conventional wisdom claims that omniscient narration creates a detachment to the characters, and I never agreed with that assessment. This book is one example why. Liesel, the book thief, is a great character and her interactions with her friend Rudy, her father and Max--the Jewish man they hide in their basement, all lead to a lot of emotional scenes that won't disappoint. While the characters may seem stereotypical--it's hard not to considering the setting--I found the Author's unique voice passionate. It's obvious he put his heart into this story.<br/><br/>I would've given this book five stars if it weren't for all the short abrupt chapter endings and seemingly endless use of "Jesus, Mary, and Joseph." The third act seemed a little weighed down with narrative that pulled me away from Liesel and her relationships, but once the story got back on track, it stayed there. I'm planning on having my daughters read this book. There are great opportunities for philosophical discussions about the morality of war and how the most innocent among us are affected. It's something we usually don't think about.
 I wanted a copy of this book and I got exactly what I wanted. The book itself is in great condition for what I'm paying for it.<br/><br/>I first read this book in elementary school more than a decade ago and recently had a renewed interest in it after seeing that they had made a movie out of it. This book was recommended to me all those years ago and I've in turn been recommending it to anyone who would listen.<br/><br/>What's it about? A young girl living in Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>After say that my friends would have one of two responses: "That's cool, I'll check it out!" or "Oh, yet another holocaust story?".<br/><br/>Yes, this book is set in Nazi Germany and obviously the environment and society of that time does play a huge role in this story. However, there was so much more to this story in particular that made it stand out to me. The timeless and heartbreaking story of innocence lost in a world of chaos and evils. In many ways, "The Book Thief" reminds me of "How to Kill a Mockingbird".<br/><br/>Definitely one for the bookshelf!
 I didn't want it to end! I cried. I laughed. I loved Death as the narrator who was like my snarky best friend who is oh so wise. I doubt there is anything that I could add to the myriad of reviews out there that hasn't already been said. This is a great book. There were so many great lines and passages that my book is all marked up. Zusak writes with a beautiful, lyrical pithiness that made my heart ache at times and other times struck me such that I literally gasped. Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful. A life-affirming story that made me ever so grateful for the life I lead.
 This is one of the weirdest, most wonderful books I've ever read! l haven't read any of Zusak's other books before, so I don't know if this is his regular style of writing, but whatever the case may be - this is an 'arty' book! I still find myself trying to puzzle it out how he was able to plan this book, because it almost seem impossible. He keep touching on some subjects and then tells the reader that he will 'come back to that' - and then he does every time! I am not fond of using the word 'amazing' easily, but this is an amazing book.<br/><br/>So, if you are a lover of stories and a lover of books and a lover of words, buy this book - both the digital and feel-in-you-hands-and-sit-on-your-bookshelf versions, because l promise you, you haven't read anything like this before.<br/><br/>An excellent read.
 This book strikes me as being written with the movie in mind, especially the startling visual openers. The narrative is well crafted, more poetry than prose in parts and it did make me want to savour and re read the lines. The characters are well developed and 3D. The device of providing a brief summary of what to expect at the start of each chapter works for me.<br/>It took me a long time to finish the book and I am not sure why. Maybe the inevitability of sadness, but perhaps it didn't really have a compelling climax. It did move me to tears (and I think so will the film) and many books don't achieve that level of engagement. So,worth reading, but not in my top 10 books. I will certainly read further books from this talented author.
 I had been wanting to read this for quite sometime and with the book being made into a movie recently, I decided it was the perfect opportunity. Knowing a little bit of the content I was wading into, I decided to offer my oldest boys (11 and 9) the chance to read along with me. Well that was a parent mistake I shan't make again. While I was not concerned that the subject matter was "too much" for them nothing could have prepared me for the language in this book. I realize it's part and parcel with the era/culture/etc but to say I was mortified by the new language my boys were learning is an understatement. Now, that said, it is an excellent book and so well written. The perspective Zusak takes is very unique and haunting. I really enjoyed this book and will read more by him in the future (just will pre-read before recommending it to my young adults).
 Death narrates the story of Liesel Meminger, AKA the book thief. Death first encounters Liesel when her younger brother dies while they are on the way to live with foster parents. Liesel steals her first book, The Gravedigger's Handbook, at her brother's funeral (even though she can't read). Her foster father, Hans, uses the book to teach Liesel to read.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is set during the Holocaust, so Death is definitely feeling overworked. Liesel steals more books and forms close relationships with the people around her, especially Hans, her foster father, Max, a Jew hiding in her basement, and Rudy, a blond boy who admires Jesse Owens. Not every German in the book is a Nazi and Zusak brings out the beauty and the horror of humanity in its many forms.<br/><br/>Death jumps around and interrupts himself, which makes the beginning of the book quite confusing. However, this book is absolutely beautiful and heartbreaking and a must-read for older teens and adults.
 I found The Book Thief to be both unsettling and compelling. The book far overreaches its target audience of young adults. Unique in concept and execution, the book heightened by respect for books and the power that words have over us.<br/><br/>Told from the persepective of German children during WWII, the narrator (Death) draws us in to the ravages of war (from both sides) and its effects on the lives of children.<br/><br/>Zusak writes many compelling scenes, but I was most struck by Liesel reading in the bomb shelter as one-by-one, the adults begin to listen to her. Words have power to hurt, to calm, to raise us above. The author certainly used them to move this reader.<br/><br/>I found the intrusion of Death, the narrator to be irritating, but I realized that was the point the author was making. If I allowed my adolescent daughter to read this novel, I would read it with her.<br/><br/>I appreciated the cover and layout, but whose idea was it to font the page numbers so that they could not be read?<br/>Reviewed by Holly Weiss, author of Crestmont
 This was a wonderful book. It was refreshing to see Nazi Germany through the experiences of the young girl, Liesel Meminger.  The book gently captures the struggle of poor German citizens who had to live through Hitler's regime and repress their own views of fairness and morality in order to survive.  The story is told by the grim reaper, whose narrative interruptions are sometimes profound but often annoying.<br/><br/>I frequently shy away from somber books like these, because we all know how grievously sad WWII was.  However, this book focuses more on Liesel's family, her life, her faults, and her experiences with war as it affects her little town.  While the effect of this story is great, it is made of sweet and small details, and that to me is the charm of this book.  Definitely worth the read.
 My book club group recently read The Book Thief.  We were not sure what to expect because we knew the book was geared towards young adults.  However, all of the ladies in the book club (mid-30's to mid-40's) agreed that the book was one of the best books we had read.<br/><br/>After reading the book, I wanted to see the movie.  As with most movies adapted from great books, the movie was a real disappointment.  It really washed down the powerful messages in the book and made the second world war seem like a fairy tale.  It could have been a movie worthy of an award if it had been a better adaptation of the book.<br/><br/>*SPOILER ALERT*<br/>Our book club has read many books dealing with the second world war, but this book was written through the eyes of the grim reaper who shared his experiences taking the souls of all victims of the war.  The book took most members of my book club some time to appreciate.  Give yourself time to get hooked by the story (25-30% of the way into the book.)
 The most popular positive reviews for this book more than cover what it was that made me love it so much. I wasn't even sure that I had anything helpful to add for prospective readers, however this novel affected me so deeply that I couldn't imagine not throwing in my two cents.<br/><br/>What I can add is how the book made me feel after I finished it.<br/><br/>I listened to The Book Thief as an audiobook brilliantly read by Allan Corduner.  By the time it finished I was so in love with the story that I ordered a hard cover edition of the book with the full intention of clutching it to my chest in adoration when I received it.  Yes, I loved it that much.  I have loved many a book in my lifetime but never quite in this way.  Some reading this might say "well I have a library full of books that I feel this way about".  I don't care!  This is the first time I've experienced this sensation so let me revel in it.<br/><br/>I have to say that I was not grabbed right away by the first few chapters but as the story progressed I was completely taken with the characters and the storyline.  Then about halfway through I realized that this was a book that I would carry with me for the rest of my life.<br/><br/>It made me laugh out loud at times, it made me sob as well but I never felt manipulated by the writing.  It also taught me how to curse in German.<br/><br/>I purposely left out specific details of the story because when I listened to it, I knew very little about it and I feel like that added greatly to my experience. I am sure not everyone will have such a profound response to this book like I did but I can't recommend reading it enough.
 This book is narrated by Death and his interest in one girl during the time of the rise of the Nazis to power. He first encounters her when her brother dies on the train taking them away from their home to a foster family. Liesel steals her first book from the gravedigger’s assistant at her brother’s burial. She has some adjustment to living with her foster family, but grows fond of her foster father. Things change dramatically when an old debt is repaid and the family hides a Jewish man in their basement, a man who will change Liesel’s life forever. This is a touching story of courage, life, and loss.
 a carousel of endearing and thought-provoking memorable characters<br/>"If we do not learn the lessons from the past. We are destined to repeat them."<br/>I cannot imagine the life of the book thief mercifully.  But if we are not vigilant it could happen.  As a child growing up in America decades after the Civil Rights movement in the Deep South.  One night at my grandmother's. window I heard a violent. commotion and I saw a. large bonfire.  I was curious so I snuck out I overheard grownups talking about and burning books some page by page.  One was Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal a biting exercise in satire which the frenzied crowd were in no mood for-<br/><br/>a carousel of emotions
 This was a wonderful book. Different, authentic, powerful. The characters will stay with me a long time. I enjoyed every word and it made me see the world differently. I thought having Death as narrator was a brilliant way to approach this. Since reading it I find myself noticing the colours of nature around me more. Not just sky colours - all colours.  To me this was a positive story in a very negative setting.<br/>The only reason I give four stars and not five was nothing to do with the story itself. It was the handwritten sections which really troubled me. I was reading late at night on my kindle and wished to continue reading but could not read the tiny handwriting. I had to wait until next day and go and find a magnifying glass. A normal one was no use. I had to find a super-powerful magnifying glass to read that handwriting.
 The Book Thief<br/>This is a beautifully balanced piece of storytelling by a young Australian writer: Marcus Zusak. The book is narrated by death himself. Death is rendered vividly. He is a lonely, haunted being who is drawn to children, who has had a lot of time to contemplate human nature and wonder about it. We are introduced to this narrator in the beginning and he is with us till the very end. It gives away the end and still wants you to keep reading on.<br/>The narrative is easy flowing with glimpses of what is yet to come: sometimes misleading, sometimes all too true. We meet all shades of Germans, from truly committed Nazis to the likes of poor Hans Hubermann who hides a Jew in the basement of his very modest home. I was humbled by the realization that most of us are incapable of doing what noble souls Hans and Rosa do for saving the human race. This is what makes this novel truly remarkable.<br/>The author says he was inspired by two real-life events related to him by his German parents: the bombing of Munich, and a teenage boy offering bread to an emaciated, withered Jew being marched through the streets. Both the boy and Jewish prisoner were whipped by a soldier while hapless crowd looked on! It is also the way in which Zusak combines such terrible events with truly believable characters and the details of everyday life in Nazi Germany. All this made The Book Thief so special for me.<br/>In addition to the protagonist Liesel (the book thief of the title), there are some very important characters in the story. Those who particularly stood out for me are Rudy Steiner, a close friend of Liesel who is obsessed with the black athlete Jesse Owens. Ilsa Hermann, the mayor's wife, who has never recovered from the loss of her own son. Liesel's adoptive parents Hans and Rosa Hubermann  and of course Max Vandenburg the Jew decorator whose father had saved Hans’ life during the first world war when they are both German soldiers. The growing relationships between Hubermanns and Liesel and, later, Liesel and Max Vandenburg are central to the plot. Max writes and illustrates a strangely beautiful short story for Liesel over whitewashed pages from a copy of Hitler's Mein Kampf (the original print can still be seen through the paint). The powerful short story and illustrations almost broke my heart.<br/>Hans, who can’t read very well himself, teaches Liesel to read. Liesel is effectively an orphan. She never knew her father. Her mother disappears after delivering her to her new foster parents. Her younger brother died on the train to Molching where the foster parents live. Death first encounters nine-year-old Liesel when her brother dies. It (death) hangs around long enough to watch Liesel steal her first book - The Gravedigger's Handbook, left lying in the snow by her brother's grave. Death has in his possession (I have always considered death as ‘she’) the book Leisel wrote about 1939 to 1943. In a way, they are both book thieves. Liesel steals randomly at first, and later more methodically. But she's never greedy. Death pockets Liesel's notebook after she leaves it, forgotten in her grief, amongst the destruction that was once her street, her home, her mama and papa. Death carries the book with him.<br/>As I went through the book I kept feeling how real Liesel was! She was a child living a child's life. A life that has chores, soccer in the street, stolen pleasures, school fights, sudden passions and a full heart! Around her bombs are dropped, maimed veterans hang themselves, bereaved parents move like ghosts, Gestapo take children away and the dirty skeletons of Jews are paraded through the town.<br/>However, there are a number of things that prevent this book from being all-out depressing. It is very powerful from the beginning but not morbid. A lively humor peeks through the pages. (a comment about German’s loving pigs, the childish chats between Rudi and Liesel). Furthermore, the vivid descriptions as well as the richness of the characters lift your spirits up. In this balanced story, ordinary Germans - those with blond hair and blue eyes are as much at risk of losing their lives, or are being persecuted, as the Jews themselves. It made me cry.
 It is easy to say that this book is unforgettable. Because it really is. I will never in this lifetime forget The Book Thief.<br/><br/>It's the other words to describe my feelings toward this book that I find hard express.<br/><br/>Heartbreakingly beautiful.<br/>Hauntingly splendid.<br/>Mesmorizingly stunning.<br/>Perfection.<br/><br/>The fact that this book is told from death's perspective is simply brilliant.<br/>The writing is spectacular, like all of Zusak's books.<br/><br/>I don't know. I will just never forget the feeling of staring at the wall in my room after finishing the last chapter.<br/>Stunning.<br/><br/>Even my mom loved it! There's really no going wrong with this one.
 I can't believe I didn't review this when I first read it years ago. It was so moving, that even though my friends have often accused me of being a Vulcan, I sat in my chair and just simply bawled out loud for at least fifteen minutes. I just re-read it on my Kindle app and I had to mop up the waterworks again!<br/>What a moving story by a really amazingly talented writer! I have also read most of his other works since I first discovered him and I very much love them, too--especially the one about the boy and the playing cards--I can't come up with the title right now, but he's directed to different places to help people in various ways.<br/>Using Death as the narrator in The Book Thief was a truly inspired idea and opened up many avenues that would not otherwise allowed the story to work so well. This Zuzak is a genius!
 I started reading this book twice - the beginning was a little hard to slog through because of the premise the author used to tell the story,  but once I got a little further into the book it hooked me. The author painted the characters so vividly that I could see them clearly in my minds eye. The backdrop of World War II and the horrific events that occurred during that time served as a stark background for Liesel's story. The attempt to live normal lives with so much uncertainty going on around them is heartbreaking. My favorite part was that the two women who appeared prominently in the book, while appearing to be disassociated and uncaring, actually cared very much for Liesel. Very moving book.
 I suppose the love, the Christ like acts of charity, the softness of goodness in the inferno of a misguided people, touched my jelly filled heart.<br/><br/>Oh that I could write as the author does. His descriptions delivered exactness of the scene. His narrator is genius. Who would ever have thought to use this inanimate being to tell a story.<br/><br/>As always I am sure that I missed the message the author delivered. I am sure there is meaning to all that he wrote that I failed to comprehend but I felt compelled to read each night. It always left me wanting to partake of the goodness of the humanity of man.<br/><br/>An insight that I gained from reading this book is that Hitler did far more harm to his own people than he did to the Jews.<br/><br/>Finally, the author profaned my Savior. That alone will keep me from recommending it to my seven daughters or my  nineteen grandchildren. As always in life there is bad mixed in with the good.
 I started to read this book simply because I wanted to see the movie.  I was hooked at the first.  The concept of using death as the narrator is most intriguing and clever.  The imaging throughout is incredible and pulls you even closer into the story.<br/><br/>No matter how many times the story of Nazi Germany is told it still brings about a feeling of impotence and horror.I devoured this book in 2 days.  Now I have to go back and read it again because I know I missed so much of it - which is something I never do.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book.  Purchase your own copy because you will want to read it again and again.<br/><br/>p.s.  I did finally watch the movie...  Of course they are never as good as the book, but in its own way it was excellent.
 It's rare that a book moves me to tears and this book did so several times.<br/><br/>I'm a sucker for good writing and the narrative style of this novel blew me away. I loved the voice and loved the unique metaphors.<br/><br/>I knew what was coming and at times I didn't want to turn the pages because I didn't want what I knew was going to happen (if you know anything about WWII, you know what's coming in this story) to happen to these characters I'd become so attached to. I couldn't stop reading even though I didn't really want to turn the pages at times.<br/><br/>I'm really looking forward to the movie now. I just hope they can do this powerful story justice.
 This story is written from Death's point of view, so at first was a little bit hard for me to follow.  Once I kept reminding myself that this was the case, it was easier for me to get into the flow of the story.  Although a work of fiction, if you know anything about the history of World War II, it is not hard to imagine hundreds of actual tales like this one.  As if Liesel didn't have enough worries (a harsh foster mother and her love of the stolen book), she is faced with harboring a Jewish man and all that it implies. The bravery and compassion in this book are at times overwhelming.  I can't count the number of times that I cried.  Both tragic and beautiful, this book is one that I recommend to all of my friends.
 'The Book Thief' is entertaining, thought provoking, and very well written.<br/><br/>It is the story of a young girl, Liesel Meminger, living in Nazi Germany during WWII.  She has lost her family and is sent to live with a foster family, the Hubermanns.<br/><br/>There are numerous subplots within the story, several of which are thought provoking.  Hans Hubermann, Liesel's foster father, takes some actions that put him in danger by helping Jews.  To avoid spoiling the plot, I will refrain from further details about that.<br/><br/>Liesel and her friends are forced to be in the Hitler Youth, but show some disdain and resistance.<br/><br/>The NY Times Book Review really oversold this saying it 'can be life changing'.  I would say that is an overstatement, but it really is 'brilliant and hugely ambitious' as they also said.<br/><br/>This book is very different.  It is certainly unique, and it is a worthwhile read.
 This is a compelling book that you won't be able to put down. It's a dark story about people who live in a constant state of suffering. However, it is, at the same time, uplifting and makes great reading. It takes place in Germany during WWll but is not about the war. It's about what happened to ordinary people during the war, with a straightforward view of Nazism and the holocaust as seen from the street. The main character, the book thief, is an innocent young girl thrust into circumstances beyond her control and comprehension, yet she survives and prevails despite the adversity that constantly surrounds her. The narrator, Death, tells the story with much compassion, in addition to realism. I highly recommend it.
 I just finished reading this book for the second time. The themes are as strong now and when I first read them several years ago. I was pleased with the actors who were in the film version and that was one of the reasons I read the book again. I wanted to "see" the characters through the eyes of the cast. I also wanted to refresh my memory. This story, narrated by Death, stresses the importance of words. It reminds us of how words can teach, convince, taint and also heal the souls of people. I have made this a permanent fixture in my library and expect to read it again at some future date. Because of the subject matter and the setting in Germany before and during World War II, parts of the story are very harsh. Don't let that deter you or you will miss one of the most important historical fiction novels of the past decade.
 I wish I had written this.<br/><br/>The angst, but not maudlin. The horror, but not hopeless. The sorrow with laughter in the middle.<br/><br/>And the prose. It read more like poetry. Symbolism everywhere.<br/><br/>And Death. The perfect narrator.<br/><br/>My parents both survived the concentration camps. The only thing I found distasteful was the author's use of the word "liberated".  There was no liberation.<br/><br/>Liberation implies intent.<br/><br/>The freedom given the camp occupants was a by-product of the war clean-up.<br/><br/>Still, I am adding this YA author to my TBR list.
 I love this book. The storytelling is unconventional, original. It grabs you and does not let go. A book with Death as the narrator (and to fully enjoy you must give yourself over to this premise) who becomes wrapped up in a child's life, and tells her story with gut wrenching honesty, is a book that must be read. Savored. Cried over. The writing is sublime, with descriptions that made me smile for the pure joy of the reading of them, and horrified me with words that cut open my soul and broke my heart.  It deals with Germany during the days of Hitler, but it is about good people and bad people, and how the power of Words created them, used them, saved them and damned them.  This book will remain with me for a very long time.
 After having just visited The Ann Frank House in Amsterdam I am now obsessed with the topic.  This is a heart wrenching yet heart warming book about a young girl and her adopted family in Germany during WWII.  It will make you appreciate our warm houses, our abundant food supply and freedoms we Americans enjoy with no sacrifice.  I can’t wait to see the movie which I hear is even better than the book.
 The Book Thief is a compelling story told from the point of view of the personification of Death.  I know that sounds gruesome, but Death is actually compassionate and sad at man's inhumanity to man.  He illustrates life in Nazi Germany by narrating the story of a foster child living in a German household.  After the loss of her own family, the child's life expands to a mama, a papa and the Jew hidden in the basement. The story is an unusual perspective on the Holocaust, seen through the eyes of clearly drawn characters -- both  marks of good writing -- but Markus Zusak's use of metaphor is absolutely genius.  They are like little paintings throughout the story.  The story is both beautiful and painful.
 I think what I liked most about this book was how human it felt. The main character is a young girl trying to find her place in a difficult world and time. She struggles with learning to read, then has such a love of the written word that she can't help stealing books. It's through this gift that she touches so many lives. The book itself is so descriptive that you feel like you're watching through a window at times. Death's constant description of the colors really helped to paint the scene. Death made an interesting narrator, his constant hinting at future events kept me constantly anticipating what would happen next. Also, as Death, he knew details relating to the story that the main characters wouldn't have known themselves. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and would highly recommend it.
 My book club read this book.  People seemed to either love it or hate it.  It wasn't the easiest book to read - some of the subject matter was hard, as you would expect about WW II but it gave me a perspective on life in Germany at that time, when previously I had only known about life in England during the war.  It made me realize how difficult life was for many ordinary German people.<br/>The characters were interesting, there was joy in the book, and the fact that "death" was the narrator was not as grim as you might think.  Sometimes the writing was a bit too poetic or odd, and the length of the descriptions got a bit tedious at times but this was a memorable book for me, and I would recommend it to somebody looking for something thought-provoking.
 I will have to bear a mourning period for many reasons after reading this. I think this book captured a piece of my soul. It will forever be a part of me. I have always escaped into my books, but I was seized and became a part of it. I felt their pain and joy and loss as if it were my own. I was EVERY character and was a part of their lives and it broke a part of me that can never be mended and I don't want it to. It made me feel empowered, grateful, feeble &amp; depraved all at once. I do not feel I deserve what I have, and tonight when my son said he was starving &amp; didn't like dinner. I simply said. "There are people who only have pea soup &amp; a small piece of bread every day &amp; if they are lucky enough to have an apple...well THAT is their joy." This book is brilliant, amazing and a little bit of reality we all need to understand. Even though this book is fiction. This is real and this is a piece of a story of so many lives. Read it and be thankful every day, for what you have.
 Books come in all sizes and colors; this one is exceptional. The Book Thief is beautifully written: its words are delicious, thought provoking, historical, and full of wonder. I would color it gold. Essentially Zusak tells the heart- rending story of a young orphaned girl in WWII Germany. Along the way, the reader falls in love with a small group of neighbors from just outside Munich. The Book Thief is a story of love, friendship, fear, anger and unmentionable suffering. Its beauty is in the weaving of the story. Its ordinary characters are heroic and unforgetable. I learned an answer to a question that has plagued me for years. How did the Germans let the Holocaust happen? Read it. This is a beautiful story you will be glad you read.
 Is this story just another version the young girl during World War II who suffers loss and yet finds a treasury in the books that enter her life during the worst of times to grow up.<br/><br/>Not really. It begins with colors of war has viewed by a foster family by her mother who then walks away leaving her crying and holding on to the fence gate not wanting to let go.<br/><br/>Liesle receives her first book at the grave of her of her brother.  She retrieves it from the snow and carries it with her as she leaves her brother behind. She cannot read it because she does not have the skills to read any book. The book becomes a symbol that carries her through the hard times of a small town in Germany learning to cope with foster parents, political changes, new friends and loss.  Death is a constant personified in this novel as an neutral observer who will ensure the story is told from many perspectives.<br/><br/>As a person who found reading a way to handle very hard times I can relate to the Book Thief and her love of reading that she shares with others.  I hope that you will read the story so I can share reading with you.
 This is one of the best stories I've read in a long time.  I confess to having a cry-meter.  If a story makes me cry the authors done his job.  This book made me sob at the dark moment even though the narrator foreshadowed to us what was going to happen--how brilliant was that?  I loved that the narrator was "death" and he has a dry sense of humor.  I loved each and every character because although the appear one way when you meet them they become something else as time goes on as their layers are slowly removed.  I liked the World War Two background and especially because it showed a side of Germans we often don't hear much about.  Those caught up in the nazi regime that didn't want to be there.  I loved how liesel was illiterate and therefore had no filters.  She was able to show us in simple words the world as she saw it through her young girl eyes.
 I loved this book.  It grabbed my attention from the first page and did not let go until it ended.  I purchased it at the suggestion of a fellow reader friend who had read the book and seen the movie.  I'm glad I did. I fell in love with Liesel from the first pages and felt as if I knew her by the end of the book.  The book is set at the beginning of WWII and the tensions brought about by Hitler's quest to annihilate the Jews from Europe are very prominate throughout the pages of the book. I found myself engrossed and unable to put the book down at times because I just had to find out what happened.  It is not a quick or easy read, but well worth the time spent reading.
 "The Book Thief" tells a story of Nazi Germany with Death as the narrator. This devise makes the story more moving if that's possible. The main character is a young German girl who becomes the foster child of a poor couple. We follow her growth and adjustment to her new surroundings with the horrors of World War II exploding around her.<br/> The title comes from her passion for books after her foster father teaches her to read in their dilapidated basement. I don't want to go further into the rest of the plot. I'm aware that "The Book Thief" has been made into a movie but there's no way a movie can capture the feeling and emotions wrapped into this book . I believe this is one of the best books I've ever read.
 Superb. From the perspective of the soul-gathering Spirit of Death, Nazi crimes prove not that mankind is hopeless, but that love is invincible, and it will come. It always wins. It will come through the human heart in the guise of music, or stolen apples shared with a friend, or sometimes with great irony, love will come to a dark basement as a map to freedom hidden within the pages of a book written by Hitler. Brilliant writing and superb storytelling. Liesel's sad but hopeful childhood shows the making of a certain kind of war hero, the writer kind, the one who replaces burnt books with the story behind the fire.
 I bought this Anniversary Edition (HC) for my daughter and luckily had a chance to get it signed by Markus in person. He told me this is his favourite edition of the book because it contains the ghostly illustrations by a friend of his. Just a tip :)
 This was excellent. The story takes hold and doesn't let go. There were times that I took a break from it because it became too intense for me. I found myself anticipating the worst and had to put the book down, but I had to come back as I couldn't stand not knowing what happened. I was relieved at the end when I realized my fear for the ending didn't happen, though it was hard enough. I've read enough about those who helped the Jews to worry about what would occur if the book thief's family was caught. It was rather macabre that Death was the narrator, but appropriate. Thank you Markus Zusak for a well-written, fascinating and sometimes profound book. It will stay in my thoughts for a good, long while.
 This book was hard to get into at first because of the way it was written. However, once you caught on to who was narrating and the purpose of the bold font notes, which at first seemed to interfere with the flow, you come to realize and appreciate the creative approach used to present this story. It is an extremely moving and also fresh approach to understanding what the German people were going through during the second world war. It takes us away from the universal judgement of " they were all complicit in this horror," and makes us think about the individuals who experienced this, and how each had their own experience and reaction as they lived through it. It is beautiful story of love and compassion.
 This is the first book I read about the Nazi-Germany and although have seen several movies about the subject, nothing compares to reading the emotions and experiences these people have to go through. It's amazing how the narrator takes us through the life and adventures of this girl, her emotions, fears and strength. It was a great surprise to find out at the end who's telling e story! So clever! I warn others, it's not an easy book to read, for the most part it's very slow, but totally worth it! What a great book! I have not seen the movie, but find it really hard to put all these events, feelings and emotions into a 2+ hr movie. The book is simply fascinating and not exaggerating when saying probably one of the best I have ever read. Enjoy it!
 This is the haunting story of a young girl and her parents struggling to survive the war and deprivation that hits their small town.  As prisoners from nearby concentration camps are marched through her town, she sees the suffering of others - others not much different than herself or her father or mother or neighbors.  She learns to escape her reality through books; her precious books.  The people in the girl's life have a startling impact on her as she grows up while the war continues and gets closer shaping her views on life and the world.  I recommend this book to everyone so the lessons from history are never forgotten.  I found it very interesting and I loved seeing the story through the young girl's eyes.
 Loved this book!  I is not about WW2 but WW2 is part of the story.  Its not about the inhumane treatment of Jews by the Nazis but that inhumane treatment is part of the story.  It is about child hood, growing up, and most of all Love.  Not just one kind of love but the love of a child and parent, the love of friends, the love life even in times of struggle and the love of spouses.  Oh and the love/hate of words and the power they carry.  It is an amazing story with a little part of the Author himself expressing his love for writing.  You need to look for that when you read the book.  Very interesting.  What a story!!
 Usually these books have the same sort of story line- with the Jewish person hiding in someone's basement, attic, closet, etc, and I was hesitant to read it at first, but this story is its own and quite different. I don't think I've read a novel like this coming from a non-Jewish perspective and it was interesting to see how they too, suffered, albeit vastly. I love this book. I never have cried reading before and I couldn't stop crying. It's not the cry where you feel guilt or shame on what mankind has inflicted upon so many, it was a good cry, that in the midst of so much sorrow, love and humanity will always be there, you just need to keep planting the seeds and letting them grow. Such a sweet story, and the author did such an amazing job invoking such creative images to my mind with the words he used. That was one of my favorite parts of the books, how he illustrated so well with his words.
 Such a unique and insightful story! Many books have been written about the holocaust and the atrocities that happened in Germany, but few have captured the emotions as well as this book. I don't want to spoil anything for those who have not read it yet, but the choice of narrator is both unique and unexpected. The prose of the story is very beautiful, and the characters capture your emotions and your imagination. After I finished it, I wanted to reread it again immediately just to catch all of the nuances that I may have missed the first time, simply from reading so quickly since I was so drawn into the story! Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Holocaust, or history in general, or who are just fans of great fiction. Read it, love it!
 I bought this book because I wanted something different to read and on most "great read" lists this book popped up. It was for a reason. I loved the way this book was written and it truly took me into this child's story and life. I loved it! Plan on reading it again in a year or so and have suggested it to my friends. Beautiful story
 I started reading this book late in the summer. It took me a bit to get into the rhythm of this book. The narrator has an unusual voice. And then after I got into the groove a little less than a quarter of the way in, my class started in the fall and absorbed all of my energy. This book fell by the wayside. But, then, alas, my Christmas break arrived and I picked up this book again. After reacclimating myself to its rhythm, I soon loved a young girl and her adopted family living in Germany in the dark shadow of Hitler and his war. Soon, I devoured this book. And my heart swelled. And I cried. This book is a masterpiece. This book truly makes me thankful I am a reader.
 It's not the first time 'Death' has been appointed narrator in fiction, but it's one of his most memorable appearances.Death is a surprisingly sentimental and sensitive character in Zusak's The Book Thief, collecting souls like one might collect rocks from a shore, but occasionally being moved to stop and ponder the beauty of some of them. One of these 'chosen few' is Liesel, a girl living in Nazi Germany, whose foster parents are hiding a Jew in their basement. She develops a friendship of such intimacy with this Jew, at great risk to herself and family, that Death finds it impossible not to feel moved by her. We hear the story of a short period of her life in which Death watches her while she goes about stealing apples, and of course books, while getting bombed by pilots and oppressed by fellow Germans and all the while trying to protect the Jew in the basement.<br/>Is it a great book? I wouldn't place it among my top 10, but it's up there. It is perhaps a little too Hollywood toward the end, no doubt why it's currently being made in to a film. But that 'Hollywood-ness' is a perfect platform for transmitting the emotions and the loyalty people like Leisel had to cultivate in order to get through this horrendous period in history.
 I just finished this book last night and I am still in such a profound haze I don’t really have the shape of it, yet.<br/><br/>Firstly, I heard about this book from a friend. She is a well-read friend, smart and snarky, and doesn’t bother finishing books she doesn’t like. Just like me, basically. She mentioned that this book stuck with her. Really good. I should read it.<br/><br/>The book is popular right now, which usually happens when a movie comes out, and while that never makes an impression on me, it does make an impression on booksellers. I was able to snatch this baby up on sale. Why not, right? Everyone seems to like it, my friend recommended it—sure, I’ll give it a read.<br/><br/>Well…I read it.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is about a little girl in Nazi Germany. And unlike many of its peers, this book doesn’t focus on the plight of the Jews, the army, or other singular issues I’ve come to expect. Instead, the scope of this book is broad, many factors of this time and place influencing this little girl’s life. We see how “normal” Germans lived, day-to-day, and their many struggles. We see those who were pushed into the Nazi party out of fear or necessity, those who jumped in, and those just trying to stay alive. This book encompasses so many facets of that era, so beautifully, that you can’t help sliding in and letting it wrap you up in the story.<br/><br/>Another thing to note: this story was told by Death. And that made it all the more interesting.<br/><br/>A few things I loved about this book.<br/><br/>1. The writing.<br/><br/>Marcus Zusak weaved words through the pages in such a beautiful way. Unique descriptions lent a certain feel to the events. I often critize writing, since I am so used to revising my own, but I had no complaints. Literally not one. For me, that is huge.<br/><br/>2. The characters.<br/><br/>They were real. The loud-mouthed, abusive-worded mother who would welcome in a Jew and sacrifice her food, her family, and her safety to keep the man alive. The kind and caring father, who had faults and problems in plenty, but who you constantly rooted for as he made tiny small stands against the Nazi party, in his own way. The shop owner, who demanded a Hiel Hilter upon entry, but turned out was just as afraid as everyone else—I could go on. Each character is woven into the story beautifully, all with moments of pride, all with moments of weakness, and all very real.<br/><br/>3. The compassion.<br/><br/>It was everywhere. Even unlikely people showed moments of great kindness. Big or small, the goodness in humanity flowered, and really lent to that profound wonder I’m still glowing from.<br/><br/>4. The portrayal of realistic, horrible events.<br/><br/>Because it was Nazi Germany, and those obviously existed. Dead bodies, bomb raids, masticated Jews marching through the town—we know these events happened, but told through the eyes of a teenage child…lends a certain feel. Then, teamed with the little specs of compassion, and the small victories in the characters’ lives, and the little perversions of the Nazi way of thinking—it’s hard to explain. You get so sucked in… It’s hard to explain.<br/><br/>Some say its harder to write a glowing review than a ranting one—that there are just more things to say with a terrible book than a great one. I’d have to disagree. A terrible book does aggravate me, sure, but I let it go so quickly. I never get invested. I never really let it seep into me and take root. A bad review would be mostly superficial, which is why I don’t bother.<br/><br/>But a great book—you can see the length of this review, and I want to keep going. I want to talk about this soft warmth I have from the intricacies of the story. Or the peaceful buzz of reading. Or the ability to put it down and carry on my day, but the desire to continue thinking about it. I want to research that time period a little more. I even want to write a few essays, to really dig down, and explore this book more thoroughly.<br/><br/>I don’t give many five star ratings. Not many at all. I am extremely critical, and demand the story be top-notch, the writing top-notch, my enjoyment high, and just…a little something extra. Not many five-star books, for me, exist.<br/><br/>My rating: 5 star
 Read the book first or watch the movie first? This is always a question. Now I read the book first and due to the author's skill in characterisation and depicting emotions and events I "produced" it in my head (probably as we all do). Later I saw the movie and to my delight it seemed as though the director had got inside my head and filmed it rom there.<br/><br/>I put this down to 2 things:<br/>1. The author's skill in characterisation and ability to progress the book with appropriate pace, colour and genuine setting for the times,<br/>2. The author had so skilfully and tightly woven the story that there was only one possible interpretation for both the reader and the movie director ... the same as that of the book.<br/><br/>A splendid read. A terrifying read at times. A heart warming look into the goodness of some adults in the frightening world of Nazi Germany AND the uplifting revelation of a young boy who, despite Nazi Indoctrination could still think for himself, feel what is right and wrong and stand at his tender age against the awful world.<br/><br/>A truly powerful read. Don't miss it.
 My favorite book of all time! I purchased a new copy for a book signing event with Markus Zusak (my old one was quite tattered).<br/>This book is by far the most captivating of all that I have read, and if you're looking at these reviews wondering whether or not to purchase this book, consider this a sign: BUY IT. You will not be disappointed.<br/>Not only is the point of view unique, the plot line takes a story in an overused time period and adds depth, originality, realistic and well designed characters, and a writing style that is just incomparable.<br/>I have read other Markus Zusak books, and honestly the style of the writing and the voice is extremely different, so there really is nothing else quite like this book.
 It took me a little while to get into the book because it was slow moving in the beginning.  But oh, how it took off!<br/><br/>It is about a young girl taken in as a foster child in Germany during WWII.  Her mother can no longer take care of her and her brother died on their way to the foster family.  It is a heart warming story of people she meets and loves as well as their trials during WW II.  Her foster parents love her dearly, even her foster mom who has a crude way about herself.  Her foster father is the strength in her life.  The neighbor boy, her good friend, loves her.  She is cared about by many because of her concern for others.  The narrator, Death, has a way of "bringing to life" to those dark days of war, even though his job is to remove the souls of the many that die.<br/><br/>It is a sad yet heart-warming story about life in Germany during WWII.  It reminds all of us what everyone went through during those dark days.
 There is a writer in me struggling to get out.  I am an avid reader, and when I discover all the writing styles out there, I think I could never be as good.  But this book changed my perspective on writing styles.  I have never read anything like it!<br/><br/>This story takes place in Nazi Germany during WWII.  This is a period of history that's fascinating to me, but equally as dark.  The story is written from the perspective of "Death" about a very young German girl, who came to live with a poor German family on Himmel Street in Molching (fictional town) near Munich.  Her mother had given her up for adoption when her father was arrested by the Nazis, suspected of being a Communist, and later her mother was taken away also.  Liesel's 6-yr old brother, Werner died on a train on their way to safety, and his death forever haunts Liesel.<br/><br/>Liesel Meminger was taught to read and write by Hans Hubermann - Papa.  Liesel was fascinated by books, which were scarce in war times, and would "steal" any she could find, whether grabbing one saved from a Nazi book-burning or floating down the Amper River outside of town.  She became known as The Book Thief.  The mayor's wife, Ilsa Hermann, who had witnessed Liesel stealing a book from the town book-burning, invited Liesel to come read books in her own home library in the rich section of town.  Later on when the mayor had told his wife to discontinue Rosa Hubermann's laundry service, Liesel got mad at the Hermann's for taking food out of their mouths, and would sneak through an open window into Ilsa Hermann's personal library to steal books one at a time over the years.  Of course, Ilsa knew Liesel was taking her books, but she liked Liesel and didn't mind.  She even left a huge dictionary out for Liesel to steal, so Liesel could discover what words meant.<br/><br/>Liesel would read each book dozens of times because she valued each one.  When Ilsa Hermann gave Liesel a blank book to write in, Liesel began writing her life story about the joys and extreme hardships she experienced growing up during the war.  The Hubermann's hid 23-yr old Jewish Max Vandenburg in their basement from the Nazi's for two years as a favor to Max's father, a soldier buddy of Hans's during WWI.  Liesel shared her books and nightmares with Max and they became close, like brother and sister.  Max left the Hubermann's after two years because he didn't want to threaten their safety anymore for hiding a Jew, and Liesel saw him again a year or so later when he was in a march of the Jews through Molching on their way to a tortuous labor camp - Dachau.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, what I've told you has only begun to scratch the surface of the depths of this book.  While it's written very simply in short excerpts, the rich human history of suffering in Nazi Germany is not just that of the Jews in concentration and harsh labor camps, but of those poor German families who had to survive bombings and the harshness of Hitler and the Nazi party themselves, whether they agreed with Hitler or not.
 I only write a review for books that grab a hold of me, good or bad, out of the hundred I read every year.  This is one of them.  When I started it, I thought it was awful.  I didn't get it, and it started slow.  But I thought what the heck, I'm at work, and I have nothing else downloaded right now.  So I kept going . . .and am so glad I did.  It was an amazing, lyrical, beautiful story.  I'm kind of partial to WWII stories and this is the first one I've read that made me feel for the German people.  Most of them weren't turned into villains, caricatures, or anything but ordinary people on the other side of one of the worst atrocities ever.  Like the books says, its the words.  If not for the words of Hitler, none of the rest of it follows.<br/><br/>It truly makes you think about our world today.  The words of hate, the words that try to make you think less of a certain class of people (in my mind, the poor).  How you make people think they're out to steal your hard-earned money, how they are free-loaders who are destroying Germany (the USA).  And once that kind of marginalizing starts, once you start to look at your neighbor as the other, how long is it until you start rounding up "those" people?  I may be painting with broad strokes-but it truly made me think about how you go from being a normal person, living your boring old life, into going along with and committing terrible crimes against humanity because a group with persuasive words convinces you its ok.  How easily it could happen again with how polarized we've become, and how truly thin that red line is.<br/><br/>I had no idea this book is a movie and I'm almost certain I won't see it.  This gorgeous book will stand in my mind for a long time, no need for pictures or half the book being left out.  I've never seen a story thru Death's eyes, as if Death was a truly sentient being.  This portrayal makes me almost wish it were true and I'm not really sure why, other than it's a really intriguing viewpoint. Others here will narrate the happenings of this book with a bazillion-word reviews, I have just a few. . .if you like WWII fiction at all, read past the slow beginning and dive into a world of both beauty &amp; horror that unfortunately was (and could be again) all too real-and enjoy the total immersion that can only come from a truly good book.
 Aside from the fact that this is a great story about a young girl (11 at the beginning of the book) in Nazi Germany, the style in which it was written fascinated me. It is narrated by Death, which is not as gruesome as one would guess but it gives an interesting perspective on Germany at this troubled time. The author also chose to give readers little peeks at what is going to happen later. It made me imagine how events were going to come about without damaging the flow of the story at all. The characters were very real to me and they demonstrated many ways to show caring and love.I am now looking forward to an opportunity to see the film that was made from the book.
 I have not wanted to write a review of this book for quite a while simply because reviewing it is admitting that I am finished. I loved this story and all the wonderful and human characters. Strange to say I loved Death, but I did. I adored Liesel and her foster parents and her friends and neighbors and their very real humanity in inhuman times. I read this slowly and didn't want to get to an ending that I knew would make me cry but when I finally got there, I was left with a feeling of peace and yes, with tears. I did not see the movie yet, and probably will one day, but not just yet. I think this story makes the characters so real to me that I am not ready to see someone else's interpretation of them yet. Very much recommend this book.
 This story drew me in from page one. Markus Zusak has a wonderful way with words.<br/><br/>  "I walked in, loosened his soul, and carried it gently away." "Somewhere, far down, there was an itch in his heart, but he made a point not to scratch it. He was a afraid of what might come leaking out." "Burning words were torn from their sentences."<br/><br/>These are just a few sentences that convey his beautiful imagery in this book. This is a very different perspective on Germany during World War II and the Holocaust. It was great to see the side of Germans that were against Hitler and wanted to protect those that needed it. I felt that Zusak captured Germany during that time; what it was like to be a non-Jewish German, a young adult, poor, watching your world fall apart around you, seeing the cruelty of war and intolerance, and yet trying to make sense of it all. This is a story that needs to be told and it is beautiful, heart-wrenching, sad, and yet hopeful.
 This book had me feeling what "Death" feels like throughout the entire story. How can we be such beautiful, damning creatures? The Wars were terrible and based upon terrible reason. But there were kind folks who attempted to help, conceal, and save their fellow humans, despite their race or ethnicity. This is what life is about: love. Man is neither good nor bad. Death is always overestimating or underestimating us, and never just estimating us.<br/>I loved that this book was narrated by Death. It's so unusual to have such a narrator. I adored the characters, especially Rudy and Papa. This book made me smile at times, but cry deeply at others. It is a truly beautiful and moving story.
 Mark Zusak has written an endearing, hard-to-put-down, heart-wrenching novel.  Set in Hitler's Germany during the war, it chronicles the struggle for survival of a group of ordinary people as Germany is gradually crushed into submission.  Their everyday existence becomes more and more brutal.  The central protagonist is a young girl given up by a mother unable to provide for her.  She is taken in by a marvelously humane couple, befriends a boy who dreams of running like Jesse Owens, and helps her family hide a Jewish refugee.  Her escape is books, precious books.  I found the prose marvelous and the mind pictures Zusak creates engrossing.  I highly recommend "The Book Thief".
 First off, I'm not really sure when The Book Thief was copyrighted. I bought the Kindle version and it doesn't say.<br/>The point is, this is a very good read! Easily the best book I've read in the past two years, (I average at least one a week)<br/>I haven't enjoyed a book this much since "Gone Girl"<br/>I was a little underwhelmed with the way the book starts. It is narrated by an entity that collects souls from humans when they expire. The "grim reaper" if you will. He never discusses philosophy or theology. It's just a job that he is frankly quiet sick of. After the first chapter however, once he gets into the tale, you just get immersed in the story and kind of forget about him. Almost. He has a wicked sense of humor and you may find that meeting him may not be as scary as you've always thought.
 I just finished 'The Book Thief' and I can honestly say that a book hasn't moved me like this one since I last read 'Sophie's Choice', which I have read three times over the past 15 years, and still remains one of my favorite novels of all time. I hadn't read much about 'The Book Thief' prior to getting the Kindle version, other than I knew it was a story set during World War II. The book just blew me away...was incredibly hard to put down, and as joyful (if a story of WW II can be joyful) as the book was at times, as well as sad at others, it captivated me in a way that no book since 'Sophie's Choice' has. Be prepared for sadness, joy and every emotion in between, but go pick up this book and read it. You will not regret it.
 I almost gave up on this book and did not finish it. It starts out really slow, and I'm a reader that if a book doesn't catch my interest in the first few pages, I usually put it down and never look back. I kept reading this one because of all the good ratings it had received, and am I ever glad I did! When Max enters the scene, that's when it gets interesting---so hang in there until you meet Max. Then, I was hooked. I fell in love with Papa and Max, and eventually the strong and courageous Liesle and her partner in crime, Rudy. It is written from the viewpoint of the angel of death and it is unspeakably moving and beautiful and tragic. This one goes down as my 3rd favorite book of all time, just after To Kill a Mockingbird, and The Fault in Our Stars.
 I have not been held hostage by a book in quite a long time.  This is one of the most heart felt books I have ever read.  With all it's pain and sorrow, it is beautiful and warm.  I felt the humanity of these people, felt their pain, was warmed by the glow of their hearts.  I am so angry for their suffering.  It was so senseless.  Evil dominated their existence yet they prevailed in their strength and love.  The book thief reminds us that the human spirit is most resilient and glorious and I am so grateful and thankful for this book.  I would love to say everyone should read this book but what I'd really like is for everyone who reads this book to appreciate it and love it like I did.  God bless the human spirit and forever may it reign.
 This is more than a touching tale. Zusak uses imagery deftly and shares feelings/emotions that are colors, even events that are colors. I’ve never read a book told from the viewpoint of this particular “collector”.<br/><br/>I adore books and if I had to, I think I could be a book thief. Yeah, I could.
 This is not an ordinary book in its structure. Its narrator is death. Its topic is the life of one person, a book thief. It is always 'overestimating' or ' 'underestimating' its human characters. An admitted flaw of the narrator, as a character. But the story is not a new one. It is a golden shaft of light in the springtime as it elaborates an old, old, pine tree that surveys the world about it. Light elaborating its scent and its sound. Its color. Roots and feathery branches.<br/>It is not a story for the faint of heart. This story speaks. Words about the power of words, their ability to shape minds, to shape vision, to shape life and death.
 This seemed to me like a long story but I will say, I still think about it.  It was a really good book.  I believed every word even though it's fiction.  It was so sad in some parts and made me so mad in other parts I wanted to scream.  I was in the hospital having a procedure done and I started talking to my nurse.  She and I both have a love for reading and read a lot of the same books.  She recommended this to me so I asked her to write it down (since I was going under anesthesia and didn't think I'd remember after).  She did and I came right home and ordered this from Amazon.  I also read "Those who save us" which I thought was really excellent.  This one was pretty good though.  I plan on getting the movie.
 Usually, when I know how a book is going to end the emotional impact becomes dulled because I could prepare myself for the outcome.  This is not the case in THE BOOK THIEF.  Zusak's tone packs such an emotional punch even when he prepares you for what is going to happen.  There aren't many stories that could do that.<br/><br/>This book should be required reading for 8th or 9th grade-which doesn't mean this book is written for young adults.  The themes and history Zusak tackles in this book are very literary and relevant.  The story here opens doors for many teaching points, which is why I don't know if teenagers could appreciate this book without a teacher's guidance.<br/><br/>In many ways, THE BOOK THIEF follows along the line of To Kill a Mockingbird in terms of literary power and thematic situations.  The Book Thief though, is much darker and morbid than To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/><br/>You will find that this book has some great characters, complete with depth and complexity.  They all come alive, especially Rudy, Hans, Rosa, Liesel, and of course Death himself.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this book.
 TBF rates as one of my favorite ten books . . .ever.  I recommend it to strangers and friends alike.  As I read it, the book struck me as a remake of Anne of Green Gables:  displaced plucky girl, cranky/affectionate step mom, kindly Heidi's grandfather-type step father, step mom's angry nemesis, problematic (aren't we all!!!) BF.  And yet the book explores this structure with an insight into human nature that's all its own.<br/><br/>I loved Death’s narration.  He alone is worth the price of admission.  He writes in haiku flashes.<br/><br/> Two truths got underscored for me.<br/><br/>One, crises don't build character, they reveal it.  Whether one sees the revelation in a sudden burst of light as step mom responds protectively to the Jew–(Warning:  I cannot remember ANY names, ANY NAMES AT ALL ANY WHERE AT NO TIME.  I struggle everywhere with this malady and I mean no disrespect in replacing proper names with descriptors.)–or in stages, as our heroine increasingly resists her country's political structure, we see character revealed, not formed.<br/><br/>Two:  Sociologist Zimbardo says, "bad systems create bad institutions which create bad situations which incite bad apples who behave badly."  Whole civilized nation succumbs to this truism and burns their neighbors in gas ovens, thinking they please God and the Fatherland.  TBF shows this process at ground level, where the evil metastasizes into the swollen lump even the untrained eye can identify as cancer.<br/><br/>I cried.  I read through meals, dripping sauce on my defenseless Kindle.  I emailed friends with my enthusiasms.  I annoyed my wife with insistent demands that she read this thing.  My 92 year old mom read it (complained about how everybody seemed to swear in the book but otherwise . . .).<br/><br/>Last thought.  TBF makes a splendid WWII-from-the-POV-of-those-who-suffer trilogy with "Milkweeds" and "Painted Bird" .  If you have some residual sense of hopefulness amidst our own gathering civil storms, DO NOT READ PB.  If you are currently on anti depressants, do not read PB.  I read PB years ago and suffered moroseness beyond bearing. I find that Milkweeds and TBF make a wonderful antidote to the powerful imagery of PB.  Nevertheless, they all three belong together in my mind.
 This is by far among the best books I have ever read. It is comparable to "To Kill a Mockingbird," Anne Frank's Diary, and others. Zusak's unique and extraordinary use of language to create incredible imagery is all at once poignant and powerful. Through masterfully strung words comes the breathtaking and heartbreaking tale of Leisel Meminger, a young German girl trapped in the painfully beautiful days of WWII near Munich. Narrated by an unexpected storyteller, "The Book Thief" is a book that will wrap its pages around you, infuse you with each character, and brand your soul with its story. A truly stunning and unforgettable read, as well as an interesting and insightful look at the horrors of that war from a different perspective.
 The author uses words in creative and unusual ways.  The book began slow as the foundational premise took some time to establish.  By mid way I became comfortable with the story being told from an ethereal point of view and found many of the vignettes so rich that I would re-read them to allow the images and descriptions to take hold.  As a World War II story of desperation and the understanding of the atrocities surrounding the characters I felt heavy and then uplifted by the tiniest glimmers of hope.  The story is both sad and a challenge to not allow the worst of our humanness to overshadow the good that is possible when we make choices to uplift ourselves and others.  As this story illustrates,  children often are able to see and behave in ways that leaders and adults cannot.  Not always an easy read, but well worth the opportunity to see how rich story telling can really be.
 It is early in the year, but so far this is my favorite among the 6 or 7 books I have read so far this year.  The story is compelling:  A real page turner.  All of the characters are complex, believable and compelling.  Recommended.
 From the very first page, the omniscient narrator DEATH, drew me into this beautifully written novel and would not let me go until the very end. This work of literary fiction, set in a little town outside Munich during Nazi Germany, gives the reader a glimpse of what day to day life was like for the German people as well as the Jews.I can't stress enough how unique this book is and how endearing the characters become. The Book Thief is classified as adolescent literature, but it is really a story for all ages. I can see, though, how the book could be used in a high school or college English class where students discuss and analyze characters, theme, symbols, irony, metaphors, and foreshadowing.
 I visited Dachau Concentration Camp 30 years ago.  I stood in the 'showers' where prisoners were gassed, and I smelled burning flesh, hair, and bone in the oven room.  The smell was still strong after all those years, and it got stuck in my throat and in my memories.  It left a strong impression on me and led me to question how and why the Jewish holocaust could have happened,  I enjoy books that explore what life was like for the average person during a time of war, and this is one of the best books I've read that were based in Germany during WWII.<br/>Markus Zusak also has a very original voice in this story, who better to narrate a story like this than Death?  It was interesting to see how a situation like this affected people so differently, turning one into a determined survivor and leading another to suicide.<br/>I was very impressed by this author and will look forward to reading more of his work.
 There are many reasons why I gave this book five stars. For one, this book is narrated beautifully! Zusak introduces Liesel Meminger, a to-be foster child, adopted by Rosa and Hans Huberman. They live on 33 Himmel Street, where the poorest of people live. Throughout her time with the Hubermans, Liesel is verbally tormented by a strict Rosa Huberman. Rather quickly, Liesel and Hans develop an unbreakable bond. Throughout this bonding process, Hans teaches Liesel to read and write. They did this for many months.<br/>The second reason being that the author takes the reader through an unforgettable journey of Liesel Meminger's life; the verbal abuse from Rosa, the relationship she had with Rudy Steiner (next-door neighbor), etc.<br/>Although this may be a lengthy book, I believe the pace of this book seems just right for a story like this.
 I taught high school for many years when I was younger, and always sort of wanted to write YA novels.  The book Thief is more than just a YA novel, but it is enough of one to make it great for young people, and adults alike.  The story reminds young minds, or informs young minds, that once Germany was a horrible place that was racist, intolerant of political dissent, and willing to use power and murder to force the masses to comply with their ultra conservative hate charged political leaders.  It praises love, family, reading, and bravery found in the most unusual places like the heart and mind of a little girl.
 I haven't seen another account of WWII  from the perspective of ordinary German children.  It gives a real feeling of what is was like to live in that time and of the heavy impact of war on families.  The physical hardship seems to have exceeded that in Britain and the fear of the regime, while not necessarily a daily preoccupation, is never far away.  Liesel's love of books is something I can easily relate to.  She is brave and caring and her best friend is a boy of adventurous spirit.  Having Death as the narrator is a more interesting device than I originally expected.  It gives an opportunity to see the larger picture of the toll of the war.  I found this book fascinating enough that I read it all in one long sitting.
 With Death as the narrator and WWII Germany as the setting, there can be no doubt as to how much of the novel will end.  But there is so much heart, so much depth to this book that it is hard to understand why it is classified as a "young adult" novel.  Yes, several of the main characters are children in terms of their ages, but they are old souls in terms of their experiences.  If I had to compare this novel to another in the way it affected me, I would say it reminds me at times of "Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close" - the unshakable bond between a father and child, incomprehensible loss that must be endured, and the power of words and pictures to help carry the grief.  I highly recommend this book.
 The author, an Australian, sets his story in prewar and war-time Germany.  And the reader is there too, right alongside the characters, who are ordinary, utterly believable people.  The book thief of the story is a young girl whose first introduction to reading is a gravediggers' manual which she purloins when it is dropped by an apprentice who had dug her brother's grave.  She becomes a silent, uncomprehending witness to the rise of Nazism, which her adoptive parents play a tiny, but dangerous role in resisting, by harboring a Jew  in their cellar.  Since reading this novel, I have seen the film.  The film makes a fairly good fist of it, but the characters are all too well fed and clothed to instill a real feeling for the vents and people described by the book
 This story swept my words away. The imagery and simple manner of telling blew me over. It  was FANTASTIC. I feel like I am WAY behind the times in just having read this book, but I can't say enough about it. I am recommending it to all my friends. There were moments reading this where I just had to set the book down, close my eyes, and soak in the words. They were so breathtaking.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book. You will not be sorry. The way the author paints his story is going to leave you dissatisfied with anything else you ever read or write in your life. But, in a good way. Fantastic work.
 The Book Thief follows a thrown together family as they navigate life in Nazi Germany.  At one point, Hitler's early popularity is attributed to the fact that he was going to "Make Germany Great Again."  Bear in mind that this book was written in 2005, long before a certain business person declared his presidential ambitions.  Are we Americans being warned?
 As an avid reader, I tend to avoid any fiction written after 1960. However a dear friend recommended this book out of the blue and I grudgingly agreed to read it. What a wonderful surprise! Even though it is considered a "youth" book (bit of slightly salty language), it is a well written and finely crafted story. The writer has taken a subject that has been covered quite extensively and chosen an approach to characters that is both novel and clever. (Both adjectives I find sadly lacking in modern literature). Keep the tissue box handy. Definitely worth a read. I couldn't put it down!
 Originally, I read the sample version but finally wanted to read the complete book. It was extremely well written.  Liesel loses her brother, and her mother abandons her, but she is given shelter in the humble home of Han and Rosa Huberman, and then when they  hide a Jew, Max, in their basement, the story comes alive.  The book gives an accurate depiction of Hitler.  How he starved his own people ( the Germans ) so he could build his "war" machine and take over the nearby countries.  The Book Thief was of course, Liesel, who finally learns to read, and is befriended by a grieving woman who has a library of books.  But the book is more than just that.  The movie was good, but the book is worth the time.<br/>Connie Hendrickx
 For those reviewers who found it 'boring' or 'odd, I couldn't finish it' I feel sorry for you. Maybe in this era of short attention span and instant gratification some of the art of enjoying an artful and somewhat lengthy story has been lost. After over twelve thousand reviews, the vast majority of them five stars, I only want to write to add my unqualified endorsement and highly recommend this wonderfully written and touching book to readers of any age.<br/>Take the beautifully developed and realistic characters of a book like "Atonement" by Ian McEwan, place these sympathetic and all too human characters in the heart wrenching, nihilistic nightmare of wartime Germany found in "Night" by Elie Wieseland and mix in clever, Kurt Vonnegut like, ironic commentary  on war and violence (but never as "clever" and contrived as Vonnegut) and tell their story with the poetry and imagery of Ray Bradbury and you begin to get and idea of the genius of this book.<br/>The book is a masterpiece and I congratulate Markus Zusak on his accomplishment.
 It is interesting to note that this novel is targeted for young adults and while this could be fitting, I think "The Book Thief" is suitable for a much larger audience.  The young heroine is fourteen and the plot is set during the turbulent Second World War.  The narrator is Death and he unflinchingly takes the souls of humans as they die but he has a soft spot for the main character, Liesel Meminger.  The book shows a different perspective than usual of the impact of the war on the German people as they are constantly hungry and many are afraid of the events occurring in their land.  While the style of Markus Zusak's book can be thought of as off putting at first, this difference pulls the reader in very quickly. I believe the impact of "The Book Thief" will remain with me for a long time and I recommend it very highly to most readers.
 This book was really, really good!  It is much better than the movie. It is very well written.  The story is told from the perspective of death.  I highly recommend this book for young adults and up.  It's a good read for every young adult and over  to read as it gives a different perspective than other period books (from s a child's perspective) as to what was happening in/during the war.  At times it is sad and heartbreaking, but I stress, it is so very good.
 This is  not a subject matter I am particularly interest in but it does not actually talk much about the war itself.  It is more about how the Germans suffered under the rein of Hitler.  It does also speak about the Jews treatment but it is more centered on the German side of things.  I am glad I read it.  The first thing about the book is getting the gist of who is actually telling the story.  Once you figure that out it is easier from that point. I figured it out by page 12, it took my sister until page 20.  It is an interesting twist on the normal story telling.  Lots of teary eyes while reading.  The last 1/3 was really good and hard to put down.  I would recommend the book if you want a long, heartfelt story.
 This book is set in suburban Germany during WW2.  Reading the first few pages, I was a little sceptical of the author's style, but then I became fascinated by both style and storyline.  The author's unique descriptive versatility and use of colourful metaphors had me spellbound, and I have kept many excerpts in my "Clippings".  Apart from all that I was captivated by the story itself.  It sometimes seems that we are fed too much propaganda which suggests that all Germans were enthusiastic Nazis, or would-be Nazis, but I strongly doubt that this was true. These simple folk were no different to poor people anywhere, but their courage and resilience were exceptional.  They didn't want a war, and they did their best to live around it.  A compelling story and I just didn't want the book to end.
 the Book Thief captivated me from page 1.  I think because it was written from the point of view of "Death" it had a more opbjective view of the events.  Each character in the book showed both the good and bad personality traits of each, but in a horrible situation, the good traits were the most obvious.  The "lesson" here seemed to be that what one often sees in a person, is not often the dominant trait.  Even though I am certainly not a young person, I think that The Book Thief does a splendid job of revealing the lesson of nonjudgement whithout being preachy to the younger generation. I feel that the book was superbly written giving me a sympathetic view of all the characters.  I read the book twice and was thoroughly immersed
 This book surprised me at every turn.  The characters were alive and very real.  After finishing the book, they continued to live with me to the point that I couldn't leave them behind to start a new book.  There are so many stereotypical stories about horrible foster parents.  This turned that stereotype on its head.  This story was about love, patience, and courage under the scourge of war for ordinary people just trying to live their lives. It gave a nuanced perspective to the Hitler years in Germany for a community of people faced with difficult choices.  This is a story that will be a part of the rest of my life, never to be put aside and forgotten.
 This book was phenomenal, well written from an interesting point of view. Until now I have never found a book that can at  both rip my heart into millions of pieces and yet make me smile. There are parts of it that are happier then others, like when Liesel and Max build the snow man, that part always makes me smile. Then there are the more numerous rip your heart out and stomp it on the ground parts, like the bombing and what happens to Werner  - lets not get starter on Rudy Steiner  kay? - while those parts are more numerous they are written just perfectly.<br/><br/>However the book did take me a very long time to finish it despite only being around 500 pages or so. Usually I could finish a book of that length in a weekend or less. The book isn't hard to read its just very heavy. I did find myself having to stop for several hours before reading it further. Of course the heaviness of the topic and the tone is to be expected from a book about a girl in Nazi Germany (Which isn't really what the book is about but that's the most basic description I can think of without spoilers) everyone's story ties in so perfectly.<br/><br/>Another thing I would recommend is maybe not being in public as you finish the book because it will make you sob. Not a lot of books make me cry (Marley and Me didn't and that makes plenty of people cry) but this one truly did. I was in Music Theory when I was finishing it up and my teacher  - who for the record wasn't teaching at the time it was the very end of class and we had 2 minutes untill the bell - and at least 5 classmates asked why I was crying (Though the one who recommended the book only laughed she knew very well why) and then I had to proceed to explain through out the day why I looked like I'd been crying. So don't finish it in public especially if books make you cry.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read and am hoping to read it to my little sister when she gets a little older.
 I am both glad and sorry that I read this book. I was invited to join a book club, you see, and this was the title they are currently reading. Normally, I avoid books about war, especially World War II. I just can't imagine the hatred and cruelty of Nazi Germany. But here is a gripping tale of humanity in all its frailty, strength, brokenness and compassion. Hans Hubermann has got to be one of the best heros of modern day fiction. And Rudy and Leisel are brave and daring best friends. War brings out the worst in some people and the very best in others. This novel, thankfully, is about the best in others.
 This is a WWII story that strikes at a reader's heart. It focuses on a young girl who is sent to live with foster parents in Germany. The kindness of her foster father wins her over quickly and it is only after the passage of time that she sees her foster mother is his match. It's a story told by a most unusual third person, and is told with a calming type of voice, with the idea that death is just another part of life. You are a witness to the happiness, the sorrows, the fears, and the struggles of the characters in a way that makes you feel that you see through to their souls. You want to get to the end, yet, when you do, you feel you've lost a close friend.
 A novel hasn't made me cry in a very long time. This one got me. Sobbing, blurry-eyed reading for the last few chapters.<br/><br/>The writing is both odd and clever in terms of word choice. It gives the story a sense of wonder because everything - even familiar things - seem new when described like this.<br/><br/>It is a story about the world at its cruelest. Beautiful moments are perhaps more so because of the context, but I can't help coming away from this feeling angry that so much pain exists. We humans are a resilient bunch.
 This was a lovely story, nicely written.  The story moved me to tears many times. Intelligent observations, poetically defined, regarding the complexities of Nazi Germany and human nature.  The characters were a bit under-developed. Overall an excellent book.
 The story within; the story of the people next door, down the street--of the people and especially the children...the personal drama and familial struggle within the emergence and development of the Nazi party in the lead up to, and then the tragedies of WWII. There is a message of hope throughout the story. The characters, especially the children, are so adaptable...a historical novel about the plight of Jewish families living/strugglilng in Germany during WWII, filled with love and caring? We know how this story 'ends.' Yet, I didn't find the narrative haunting--despite what lingers the children's adventures remind us/show us the spirit of life, of survival through the harshest challenges.
 I saw the film first but so glad I read the book.  The history behind the story and the making of the film is as compelling as the words on the paper.  An inside look at the life of children in Germany during the Holocaust was very personal since my dad was a survivor.  It humanized the average hard working mom and dad and how far they would go to protect their children who happened to have been born in Germany during the worst time in modern history.
 What can I say. This book really makes you think and realize how complex and precious life is. I did not give it 5  stars only because it was slow to get started. I was over half way into the book before it really started getting good. It was so slow that I almost give up on it. Stick with it and you will be glad you did. It is amazing at the brutality of man against man. Times like these during the war make a man or woman realize just how cowardly and weak the human soul is. We all think we would never do this or that but until you are faced with reality you never know. This book challenges you to seek; what would you do in these same situations?
 I haven't seen the movie, but unfavorable reviews made me reluctant to read this until a friend recommended it.  I'm so glad I did.  Some of the film criticism suggested that the story was not serious enough for something set amidst the Holocaust.  This is a story about ordinary people, not politicians or heroes.  Many of the characters are anti-Semitic; many are simply ignorant and duped by their government.  A few are unexpectedly compassionate souls, who risk their own meagre safety to save another, not for some high ideals but out of their own humanity.  This is a beautiful story of the many ways that people love and care for one another under the worst circumstances.  I highly recommend it.
 What I find so intriguing about this book is that it is told through the eyes of an unusual narrator who very thoughtfully prepares you for events to come. This helps to handle the tragedy of the story. This book is multilayered in content and makes you think on many levels. There is so much love in this writing and humanity amongst all of the inhumanity.<br/>I bought this book a year ago and put off reading it as I was concerned about the subject matter being too depressing. I'm so glad I finally braved the material. I loved the characters and feel they are now a part of me. This is a classic and Markus Zusak is an inspiring author. His writing is both eloquent and poignant.
 I am a voracious reader...lover or great fiction.......due to my present geographic location a lot flies under the radar.....a dear friend suggested this book....I am just shy of half way through its 550 pages. I have already sent a copy to my niece and another friend.<br/>Yes...550 pages seems long...but the build and pacing and character development have been perfect. The tones and colors...the feel...it would have been epic failure to have done this in 1/2 the pages...robbery. I haven't come to the climax of the story admittedly..but I don't foresee disappointment....I am hoping the film will do justice....Bottom line...buy this book. Especially at amazon price.
 At first I was a bit skeptical since the writing style is rather unusual.  However, in no time at all I was totally engrossed and couldn't wait until I had a free moment each day to sit down and read.  It is the kind of book where the characters become your friends.  While you are reading, you are living in their world and when it is over, you won't stop thinking about them and wishing there was a way to stay friends with them forever.  It is a sad topic, which I usually try to avoid (I cried the entire way through Sara's key) , but this author manages to tell his story without making the reader feel depressed.  I did not shed one read (and I am a cryer)  Please take a chance on this one.  I promise you will not be disappointed.
 I would give this book a million stars if I could! Wow. What a read. It is an absolutely breathtaking novel on so many levels. The point of view - narrator - is death himself. The prose and language is so gorgeously written and the characters and plot will blow you away. I fell in love with every single character and felt every emotion they felt - and in a book like this, that was at times difficult. They endured so much My heart broke so many times while reading this book. I will definitely reread this one!
 Markus Zusak's The Book Thief is a novel I'd been wanting to read since it was released a few years ago. Winner of many awards for young adult fiction, this book provides a unique view of life during World War II. The story is told by Death and features a young girl growing up with a foster family in Germany.<br/><br/>Zusak is a wonderful storyteller. The fast-moving chapters, interesting keyword chapter introductions, witty embedded notes contribute to the author's unique writing style.<br/><br/>The Book Thief would be a wonderful addition to a literature circle project that explores World War II from different perspectives.
 I love complex stories about human nature, intertwined with historical settings of interest. This book had me repeating and quoting lines from it, I found it so profound.<br/><br/>Those interested in the history of WWII and of Germany during that time will find a glimpse inside the minds of purported individuals. Inside the possible groups of people within a German community during Hitler's reign of terror.<br/><br/>I can't recommend it enough!
 stealing books seems an unlikely thing for a very young girl to take up but in this story you will come to learn that it is something she must do.  Germany, prewar World War II is a scary place to be especially for a child who has become a foster child and is unsure about a lot of things.  The need for something to hold on to is very important and the books become just that.  This is a story of acceptance, love, survival and strength in a very troubled time in history.  Everyone regardless of age must read this book.  The movie is also wonderful but read the book first for detail and insight.
 I am glad there is a movie out, but I like to read the book. I wish this book were read by Junior High School kids. It is funny, about 11 year olds,  has a little swearing  (but not too bad) and tells what happened in Germany to the regular people just a bit more. ( so we can understand how this happened). And also....JUST  What was really happening with the Jewish folks. This really did happen !  Many now, want to deny it!  Let us  give our children a bit of history, as it really was, in a little bit nicer introduction! In High School let us study it and see that it does not happen again ANYWHERE.
 I was engulfed in this story.  It was a selection by my book club but I would have chosen it based on the time period it covered.  I never expected it to be so intriguing and emotional.  My husband and mother in law also read it and were glued to it.  I can not say we enjoyed it as the subject matter was so horrendous and painfully true but it could become a classic in time, similar to To Kill a Mockingbird in my opinion.  I haven't heard a bad review b y anyone I know who has read it.  Went to the movie after I read the book and it pretty well followed the novel.  Another must read for all generations....
 I was enthralled with this story. I have never thought of what it must have been like in Germany during the war. Words are so powerful and Hitler did use them as his weapon. It should caution us on their power and how we can be sucked in by them. Words and their importance are all thru this story. The book Leisel wrote and Max's writings were weapons against all that they suffered. Rudy was an amazing character too. Death is the narrator and looking at things thru that perception really was ingenious. Excellent book. Movies don't ever capture what you can get from a book but I hope to see the movie soon too.
 I read The Book Thief, feeling as if I was part of the lives of the characters. Parts were hard to read, as death could lurk behind every turn of the page.  Literally, as the story was narrated by Death himself.<br/><br/>I've read many stories set during WWII, as my Dad fought in Europe in this. Time, but this is the first I've read set in Germany, with German people enduring the war and being bombed by the Allied Forces, rationing, and helping to hide people being persecuted by the Nazis. A very different perspective.<br/><br/>Very worthwhile, and it will be hard to find something appropriate to follow this.
 A tale told by Death. Haunting, heartbreaking, deeply disturbing, and tinged with the deepest shades of gray. Hard to put down, yet hard to read. Redeemed by the underlying story of how goodness cast its light, like sparse flickering candles, across the black landscape that was Nazi Germany. I gave it four stars only because I, personally, would have enjoyed the novel more had the young protagonists not been portrayed with such blasphemous mouths. I fail to understand why modern authors have deemed it advantageous to trade coarse words for the rich verbiage our English language offers and which once characterized literature over decades and centuries.
 This is a wonderful book and the movie made from it was so well done that I hope you'll read the book before your see the movie.  Trouble is, I read about a third of the book, then saw the movie.  Shouldn't have done that, but the movie was not going to be at my local theater much longer so I didn't want to miss it.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie is so well done that I'm no longer motivated to read the rest of the book.<br/><br/>It's about a young girl who must go live with foster parents and she learns to read with the loving help of her wonderful step-father.<br/><br/>One interesting aspect is that the story shows what it was like in Germany at the start of the second world war.
 Love this book.  Written from the perspective of Death gives it an illuminating criticism of Nazi Germany.  The detailed descriptions of the characters, their actions, and the setting allow the reader to step into the time and emotion running through that time in history.
 The story is wonderful and harrowing at the same time. Because Markus Zusak uses Death as the character narrating this story, much of it feels gloomy and gray. But the tale is woven beautifully, taking readers on the story of a girl coming of age in the midst of one of history’s darkest hours. Liesel is a girl who, already living in abject poverty in Nazi Germany, loses what little she has: her brother, her mother, and eventually much more. Despite the losses, she finds that love and friendship come in different shapes and sizes. She learns to read with the help of her adoring foster father, and starts to write because of other relationships forged during a very trying time. The Book Thief reminds readers that words are very powerful, and can even sometimes determine whether one lives or dies. This is both tragic and compelling reading at its best.
 Liesel Meminger is a foster child  girl] living outside of Munich. How she arrived there is not so important. This book is about her new life, the new family and her love of words. It's about an accordion, a Jew, a bunch of fanatical Nazi's and a boy with hair the color of lemons. It is about deprivation and despair... rationing and sharing. But mostly, it is about learning to read and write, to love and to mourn, to care and be cared for. It all starts in 1938 in Himmel Street, outside Munich in the town of Molching. It's not about triumph and turmoil... just turmoil, more turmoil and survival. READ THIS BOOK.
 Despite the historical savagery of Nazi Germany, this author was able to convey kindness, giving, acceptance and love by fostering a little girl and a Jew. Death, the narrator, was almost human. The balance of these with the horror, sadness, dying and fear of war, stirred every emotion in me and in the end, Hope prevailed.
 Death narrates the story of Liesel Memling as she tries to navigate her way through a society at war. It's a daring device, but it really does work in a way that few could manage. Zusak is a master of style, his elegant phrasing and fresh imagery bring the characters and their world to the reader in a way that is never patronising or trite - the omniscient narrator shows us the souls of people, sometimes literally, and gives us his/hers/its opinion without it detracting from the rhythm and pace of the story.<br/>The very title shows something of the flavour of the book: unexpected juxtapositions that repay a second look and then a reflection about the deeper meaning. In the same way, the unfolding of the story and the development of the characters is never predictable. Even the books Liesel steals have titles that make you wonder and the little book-within-a-book is a poetic masterpiece.<br/>I have read many stories based in the second world war - this rates among the very best.
 Although WW2 has been much written about I loved reading this book for several reasons:<br/><br/>The style of writing is beautiful and the choice of narrator unusual, making for a range of narration styles from rather detached, to deeply emotional to abstract. To me this made it very real because this is representative of how humans experience the horrors not only of war but of life itself.<br/>Yet at the same time everyday life continues and sometimes we simply experience a bluntness just to get by.<br/><br/>I have heard and read many stories of ww2 and not all Germans were horrid Nazis. Many were decent human beings taken over by events beyond their control. Experiencing this time through the life of a young girl who simply lives and survives with her friend, her love of books, and the love and caring of her foster parents.<br/><br/>The book does not lecture, it does not tell us what to think, it just lets us experience.<br/><br/>I believe that a good children's or young adult book is one enjoyed by all ages and The Book Thief delivers this.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book to adults of all ages.
 I watched this movie several times and loved it so I wanted to read the book. It is excellent! It is 100 times better than the movie. the details are phenomenal. I got engrossed in the story. Highly recommended.
 Do we need another telling of lives affected by World War II? Yes. We do. As long as Marcus Zusak is doing the talking. "The Book Thief", Zusak's latest novel, isn't like one you've read before. It's as if C.S. Lewis' Screwtape met up with Lois Lowry's "Number the Stars" cast, of youth fiction fame. The result is a smart and endearing story of a preteen who, although she steals a few books, is thoughtful and selfless, and the alternating curt and empathetic narration of Death - yes, Death - who despite our preconceptions of the reaper, makes for a good tour guide, reassuringly stating, "I urge you - don't be afraid. I'm nothing if not fair."<br/><br/>Liesel Meminger is a foster child in Molching, Germany during the Third Reich. She is cared for by the Hubermans, empty nesters who can barely stand each other. Hans is a house painter and accordion player. Rosa takes in laundry, makes inedible pea soup, and calls Liesel mostly "saumensch", a German insult relating to the word "pig".<br/><br/>It's a rough start for Liesel, with daily nightmares and foster mom Rosa's cold demeanor, but the young girl finds friendship in the quiet and patient Hans, whom she calls Papa, and the delightfully deranged kid next door, Rudy Steiner, who thinks he's Jesse Owens. Zusak uses the characters to pause the larger and more dismal picture and focus on small joys. In one such instance, Rudy and Liesel find a coin in the street and take it to do what kids do when they find money. "Mixed candy, please." Being that the coin was only a pfennig, they end up sharing a single piece of hard candy, taking ten sucks each before passing it back to the other. They walk home, red mouths and all, smiling along the way. "The day had been a great one, and Nazi Germany was a wondrous place." The diametric theme drives the shaky graph-line of ups and downs. Death even delineates the book's thematic quakes, "the contradictory human being. So much good, so much evil. Just add water."<br/><br/>Circumstances soon bring "Papa" Hans face to face with a promise he made during the First World War. And so the Hubermans hide a Jew in their basement. "Imagine smiling after a slap in the face. Then think of doing it twenty-four hours a day. That was the business of hiding a Jew." The layers of friendship and family are made rich by Max's arrival, and the range of life and death is deepened.<br/><br/>Zusak's creative format and precise language provide interest and momentum. The narrator, with quick bites like, "A fire would be lit. A book would be stolen," seemingly gives everything away, only to carry the reader to the next beautiful moment when nothing was actually spoiled but everything is realized and the rhythm of the book beats on in its steady, throbbing, idiosyncratic way.<br/><br/>Although the full effect of Nazi book burnings, the marches of emaciated Dachau Jews, and Hitler Youth rallies are not hidden from view, "The Book Thief" is not gratuitous; after all, it is a young adult fiction, albeit one that should be read by adults, too. It assumes the reader to fill in the blanks, and is as much a story about life as it is about death. Just as the characters all find their diversion somehow - Death in colors of the sky, Max in weather reports, and Liesel her solace in words - so the reader finds wonderment in the worthy hearts of those pictured in "The Book Thief", if only to temporarily distract from the backdrop of atrocities that must also be told.
 Both my wife and myself read this book . . .  and both thought it was one of the best we have read in some time.  The writing style and flow were intriguing, fascinating and captured both our attention.  While I am usually an "action book" lover, I also like good well told stories . . . and this one was so easy to picture in your mind as it unfolded.  It occurs during a tough time in our world's history and illustrates there were "innocents" in small village Germany during WWII who were swept up into  situations over which they had no control, but witnessed and were forced to endure.  Your heart aches for "Liesel," who wants to learn to read, but is forced to watch as books are burned.  And "Pappa", whose large heart and gentle soul finds ways to tenderly show love and compassion. . . to everyone who needs it. . . or is in danger during dark times in Hitler's Germany There are times you laugh with them . . .or feel the extreme tension with them.<br/>Read the book . . . then see the movie.  The little girl who plays Liesel is perfect and Geoffrey Rush is perfect as Pappa.
 Compelling narration once I understood who was narrating the story. The suffering of people can really bring out character and truth. The survival stories of Liesel and Max can be the only merited ending. At last! Will want to reread later on. Now I am too raw.<br/>Great book.
 Wow.. such a moving book. I'm so glad I stuck with it. For me, I struggled understanding the perspective of death initially. I left and came back to this book numerous times. But even when I left, I was always drawn back for more. It was a time in history that triggers such curiosity and disgust at the same time. I can't imagine living with the horrors they dealt with daily for years. Good read!
 This is a lovely book telling the story of WWII from the point of view of Death in Germany. The Book Thief is a young German girl who grows to young womanhood during the war.  She learns to read and falls in love with words as her world crumbles, is rebuilt and then destroyed again over a period of 5 years of infamy.  The story of these poor Germans who have the injustice of Nazism and war destroy their lives and their small town just outside of Munich is written by the young Australian son of a German survivor of WWII.  It really is an "Anne Frank" type story and perhaps is the answer of  those left of how this happened.  He makes clear that like his own mother,  there were innocent German citizens who did not agree with the politics of Nazi Germany.  There were innocent men, women and children who did what they could against this insanity , but paid anyway with the loss of their lives, their friends, their families. How this madman and the hatred that he spewed took control of their people and spun the world out of control. How even the good and blameless paid with their lives in the end for what the madman and his hatred had brought to fruition.
 A very moving story of a young German girl during the rise of Hitler. The perspective of a non-Natzi family puts the focus on how and why many joined the Nazi Party. This is a very human story of the basic level of survival in a time of great turmoil.
 I always feel heartbreak about Nazi WWII mistreatment of the Jews.  This one took me to the other side of the glass where we were the German residents experiencing the war from within Germany.  The character development was very good and I felt the characters come to life within the narration.  A very clever choice of a narrator.  I raced through the book because I wanted to see the movie as well. The movie only brought half the story to life, as all good books made into movies. I strongly recommend this book because I cared to see what was going to happen to its characters.
 The Book Thief is timeless.  What happened then is happening now.  Evil exists.  Beauty exists.  Compassion exists.  The human spirit triumphs. But how can we impress upon good people how quickly our lives and future can be changed through subtle propaganda, the planting of ideas and thoughts in the young and vulnerable, and the political agenda of class warfare which riles people up and changes them, pitting one group against another?  It happened in Nazi Germany.  It is happening here and in other places where the people have stopped paying attention, and have grown weary and lethargic.  As the desperate young man Max clings to life and hope in the basement belonging to a compassionate German family, he composes a parable for his "sister" Liesl.  I cannot get these haunting lines out of my head, because I recognize the signs happening today.  We have to confront it, and oppose it with our hearts and souls to save our personal and collective freedom. We must do it for our children and their children.<br/><br/>  "Yes, the Fuhrer decided that he would rule the world with words...His first plan of attack was to plant the words in as many areas of his homeland as possible.  He planted them day and night, and cultivated them.  He watched them grow, until eventually, great forests of words had risen throughout Germany...It was a nation of farmed thoughts.  While the seeds were growing, our young Fuhrer also planted seeds to create symbols, and these, too, were well on their way to full bloom.  Now the time had come.  The Fuhrer was ready."<br/>  "He invited his people toward his own glorious heart, beckoning them with his finest, ugliest words, handpicked from his forest.  And the people came."<br/>  "They were all placed on a conveyor belt and run through a rampant machine that gave them a lifetime in ten minutes.  Words were fed into them.  Time disappeared and now they knew everything they needed to know.  They were hypnotized."<br/>  "Next, they were fitted with their symbols, and everyone was happy..."<br/><br/>  The people were told what they could read, what they could think, and what they could say. They were told to despise the weak, the handicapped, the mentally challenged, those who were successful but didn't share their wealth or give their fair share (Sound familiar?), and the Jews.  All books were burned to destroy any thoughts of liberty, independence, personal responsibility, or justice.<br/><br/>  We are bound to repeat the mistakes of  the past if we don't know our own history.  Our children are now learning a "revised", politically correct, and empty version of our past.  Parents should read this to their children as a warning about what can happen when we lose interest and stop paying attention.  We must never let this happen again.
 I loved the fact that this book could transport me back to WW2.....feel the pain, tears, the few happy times &amp; such deep love.<br/>The ending was the hardest.....you tend to want happy endings, but real life doesn't always have happy endings. There were parts of the book that were so emotional at times it made me feel like my throat was closing up from emotion, but that only happens when the book has made you know the people in the book &amp; you love them.<br/>I would recommend this book to anyone, especially to others that had family that served in WW2, such as my uncle. The horrors everyone saw, the experiences that forever changed their lives! It was indeed a 5 star book to me!!
 This is a very good book, made more relevant to me as I had just visited Dachu, the German prison camp for political prisoners near Munich, this past fall.  It is good to see the story through the eyes of a child who loses her father, mother and brother, then is adopted by a German couple living in Munich.  The years pass slowly.  It is well written, and can actually give us insights today.  We see people, regular people who mean well, but on't realize until too late that they are supporting prejudice and bigotry.  Unfortunately we see it in those we know.  We fear those who are different, whether in looks, philosophy and definitely circumstances from our own.  it is so easy to blame others.  I would like to think we have progressed, but unfortunately our world is still full of people hurting each other.  So wish we had come farther.
 This heart-warming book, narrated by Death, was so uniquely written that it warms your heart as you read it. It focused on a different aspect of Hitler Germany. Rather than the usual fighting, it told of the daily lives of the poor German people who were affected by the war, particularly one girl who became the book thief. The love for her Mama and Papa was real and well portrayed. Beware, the end is a heart breaker. As a mother who lost a son, I was comforted by the way Death had compassion as he gently and almost sorrowful  lifted away the souls. I definitely recommend this book as a must-read for its history, compassion, and how important and powerful written words can be.
 The Book Thief is a profound and moving novel of humanity at its best and at its worst.  I won’t give a synopsis because it’s already been done on the Review page and much better than I could have done.  But, if you like character driven novels that reach down inside you and tug at your heart strings, I can recommend it with 5 solid gold stars.  The author has been able to create characters with which the reader can empathize while, at the same time, recognize any faults they may have.  Tears of sympathy came to my eyes several times as I began to love the lower income neighborhood that is the setting of the bulk of the story and the people who inhabited it.
 This was good. The story was not a new one but the perspective through which it was written draws you in. The writing was really good and, again, through a much different perspective I felt like I could be there through the whole story. Makes you think!  I would definitely recommend this book.
 I'm a fan of historical novels and this is a good one.  Not only does it tell the reader about the lives of regular people in Nazi Germany, it helps you understand the divide between them in their quest for survival.  What kind of people followed Hitler is a recurring theme in this book and what lesson can take from those who risked their lives and covertly rebelled against the wave of popular belief?  They're all in this book, even the narrator provides a perspective that I've never considered before.<br/>I bought the Enhanced version only because it was the cheapest Kindle version but I didn't watch the video.  I didn't need to because the book painted a colorful enough picture.  Must read.
 My daughter was given The Book Thief to read as a summer assignment for 9th Grade Honors English.  I bought this Study Guide as a way to go over vocabulary, concepts and questions to make sure she retained the information that she read.  It is a really nice study guide.  I highly recommend it.  Not only does it go over the background information for the setting of the story, but it covers metaphors, irony, vocabulary and discussion starters.  Worth every penny!
 This book is written differently than any other I've read I don't want to spoil anything if you haven't read it yet but the narration is great. you can connect well with the characters and i like how it isn't a full mystery of what happens. adds just the right amount of German that it adds some spice to the novel. This is a must-read.
 I purchased this book after seeing the movie advertised enjoyed it very much. This is one of my all time favorites.  I also read The Boy in the Striped Panamas and The Boy on the Wooden Box, all about the Holocaust  but the characters in each were in different social statuses. One's father was a high ranking Nazi officer, one a German who did not have to flee and the last a prisioner in the camps. Really great insights in to the differences in their lives.  In the Book Thief there is a little light humor and sadness.  I really enjoyed the characters and could almost picture themfrom their descriptions.  I highly recommend this book.
 I thought this was a wonderfully written book.  Yes, the style become a bit much towards the end but I thought the story and the characters were beautifully described.  Of course I am attuned to the story because I lived in Berlin (although only in the later 1930's) and have felt some of the atmosphere in Germany at that time.  The three children, to me, were the core of the story and I have always had an affinity for young children who have to suffer because of what adults have wrought.<br/><br/>The fact that Death is the narrator and (and busy) protagonist is very good choice.<br/><br/>I felt deeply about the characters and found the writing suitable to the subject matter.
 I couldn't come up with a better 'title' for this review because that says it best.  I was simply stunned when I finished.  This is a major addition to the fiction of WWII.  The characters are mesmerizing including Death himself who is as pained at the senseless loss as anyone.  It was a wholly original book on all levels, especially in characterizations.  This brought me to tears and cared so much for each and every character.  I've heard that they are making a film of this novel: READ THE BOOK FIRST.  There is simply no way that a movie will capture all that makes this book remarkable.  For everyone who ever loved words, books and humanity - this book is a classic.
 I did love this book, as well as the movie. I felt it was difficult to follow his writing style in the beginning -- much different than usual. But once I got used to it, I enjoyed it. I am not sure"enjoying" is the right term for a heartbreaking story from WWII. It definitely got me thinking about how those in Europe often had to carefully live two different lives if they were not believers of the Nazi regime. Overall a great book.
 I saw the movie and had to read the book! Zusak is an amazing author and I LOVED the perspective of the narrator. I won't give away who the narrator is, but after a few pages into the book you will understand. I don't know why WWII stories are so fascinating and I never tire of hearing about the triumphs and tragedies of that awful war. You will fall in love with Liesel, Hans, Rudy, Max and the other characters that Zusak brings to life. Once you crack open this masterpiece, you won't want to put it down. Read the book first, then watch the movie.....both are well worth your time!
 This was an incredible book! I have read books about WWII that are incredible about the suffering endured by the Jewish individuals... Horrifying what has happened...but I have never read anything about being a German in that country and the suffering they endured as well at the hands of Hitler and his madness, or imagined the effects on those who were so horrified by it. This book, although fictional, is an incredible portrayal and through the grounded eyes of a young girl, Liesel. It's one of my favorite books of all times. I highly recommend this book and journey!
 Anything about Nazi Germany will be a dark story, but when told by the grim reaper himself it takes on a very interesting tone. It took a few chapters to get into this book but then it became very interesting and I really enjoyed the literary style. Leisel is a young girl who is present when death visits numerous people in her life which is why he is able to tell her story. The fact she 'steals' books seems kind of secondary to the story, the important thing about her is the interactions with everyday Germans who do not believe in the tyranny of the Third Reich.
 This is a spectacular story and beautifully written.  Markus Zusak's prose is wonderful.  The store weaves in and out like a tapestry with many threads that come together to form a pattern before creating a new pattern.  This is a book I'll read again and recommend to my friends.<br/><br/>I first bought this as a Kindle book and couldn't get into it.  I told my daughter and she suggested I get the book.  Part of the problem with the ebook is that the story is written with drawings and different type fonts that help move the story forward. Reading the paper edition was so much better.  Get the book and be sure to share it with others.
 While reading certain books, you realise that there must be something divine smiling through the writer's pen when he wrote that. This is one such book. It stands out for subtlety of emotions, elegant representations and magnificent motifs. What a book. This is a work of literature which I sure hope will stand test of time and public apathy to literature. Though categorised such, it is not a statement on holocaust, nor is it sadness which has lost its beauty. It is a sublime beauty, a story of innocent childhood which unfortunately falls in the times of Nazi extremism.
 I had heard this was a "good book" and began reading it at 5:30 pm with an ashy weeping sky to my back. at 1 a.m. my Kindle registered 51% complete and I forced myself to set it aside.<br/><br/>I couldn't keep away from it. this story will clutch you by the heart and not let you go until at last the robins awake and announce that the sky is brightening along the edges.<br/><br/>I write this with a tear stained face and hope my father, my papa will come and sit next to my bed while I search for sleep, although I know the Narrator has already gently carried him home. I know because I was there when the last breath left and he sat up for his journey.<br/><br/>this is not a book you will forget. read it as soon as possible.
 This style of writing took some getting used to, but after the first few chapters, I loved it. This is a great novel of an era past; of Nazi Germany, imprisionment and dark secrets. A good look at an era gone. Excellent read once you get used to the style of writing. I recommend reading the first review, it will give you a good insight to this sweet novel, where books are cherished because the enemy is destroying all of them as fast as they can. The only way to get education and information is by reading, therefore one must get their books any way they can in order to learn.
 THIS WAS a truly wonderful book written from the perspective of an orphaned German girl taken in by a poor, very poor, German couple in Munich during WWII.  And I've read so many things from the perspective of everyone else, it was about time I considered the losses of the German people too.  And this book masterfully does just that.  I highly recommend it..  The only thing.  . .when I first started the book and realized the character who was narrating the story. . . I was truly taken aback and I stopped and paused to see if I wanted to continue.  I am glad I did.
 I'll try to write this without any spoilers...<br/>This is a well written book with engaging characters and an interesting perspective of narration.  It is a fictional account set in Nazi Germany.  The author does a good job of showing the humanity of Germans living at the time without crossing the line into Nazi sympathizing.  The book is not suspenseful.  Several times the narrator tells the ending of a story arc before telling the details of the middle.  The point is the emotional state and connections between characters and the events going on around them.<br/>I gave it four out of five stars because at times the narrator got a little tedious moaning about himself and his job. Also, the ending seemed a little abrupt and left several questions unanswered.  I would recommend this book to people who want a study of emotions and tragedy without bringing the reader to the point of catharsis.
 I didn't think I would like this book as much as I did. Especially after noticing it was listed as a YA novel. My sister kept insisting that I should read it so I finally relented. I usually don't like books where the author gets ahead of his or her self then jumps back to the story line, but I got over it. This is a very good story that I found both powerful and moving at times. I'm glad I read it!
 I've never before considered or heard a perspective of Nazi aggression/oppression from an average German family.  The narrator is "Death" and its observation of a young girl, Liesel, who is given up by her mother because her husband, Liesel's father, was a Communist.  Her foster parents, especially "Papa," dare to hide a young Jewish man due to a promise made his father who died in WWI.  Papa teaches "the book thief," Liesel, to read and she will take great risks to steal or save a book. There's also a movie which stays fairly close to the story line, but I'm so glad I read the book first.
 Make sure you read this before you see the movie.  It is so much better and sticks to history well.  A story of a young girl in Germany during the war years that was given away to a foster family due to safety issues.  The beginning is very sad and you won't soon forget it.  Her conditions in the foster home were dysfunctional and scary at times, but she is very resilient and finds friends and love, such as it is, from these parents.  You will come away touched by this child and her ability and drive to learn to read, survive, and make something good out of her life.
 This book is so cleverly written, it dulls the discomfort of the subject matter. Which is brilliant.  I kept having to remind myself I was reading about Germany in the Nazi era and bad stuff is very likely to happen. And it did - but simply because of the poetic style, clever prose and 'devilish' narration, it was a pleasure to read.  I kept reading bits out to friends and family to share the writer's skill.  It does cover the subject and characters very well, but from an angle I have never heard of before.  Yes, I cried.  And these subjects ought to be written about for every generation to understand the history.  So glad Markus Zusak wrote about it in a way that my 17 year old daughter can read, understand and learn from, without deliberate shock value. And from the point of view of a few ordinary Germans to see how they saw the situation and coped with it. Good to remember not all agreed and some fought back without guns and many suffered too.
 This book was written by an amazing author, set in 1943, in Germany,in the middle of the 2nd world war. It follows the life of an orphan girl, who is taken in by foster parents and kept safe by them. She is determined to learn to read and write. And she not only succeeds in her ambitions, but finds ways to acquire the books to accomplish them.... She then puts her knowledge to use helping friends and neighbors. I wish I could write a Great review, that would convince some of you to give this one a try! It is truly a remarkable book..Patricia Dunn (Grambie)
 I loved this book.  The author is new to me, but he has outstanding talent.  The most striking part of the book for me was the narrator.  What a unique approach!  I normally avoid books that deal with the holocaust and other evidences of man's inhumanity to man, but this book was different.  The material was disturbing of course due to the time frame in which it was written, but Zusak creates characters so real and compelling that it prevents the book from being a horror story. I have not seen the movie....it has come and gone....not sure I want to since the movie is in my head after reading the book!
 To try to summarize this book would be to do it a disservice.  Read it.  Zusak achieves a truly original voice in that of Death, the narrator.  As I read it, I kept asking myself a question that Death, himself, ultimately asks in the later chapters: how can a thing be so beautiful and so ugly at the same time?  The beauty of the language and the ugliness of the topic of Nazi Germany sit side by side in a puzzling, yet deeply satisfying dissonance throughout the book.<br/><br/>A girl.  A boy.  A man. A woman.  War.  Life.  Words. Their power. How people live.  And how they die.  Read it.  Every page will offer at least one sentence that stops the breath in your lungs with the beauty of its unexpectedness.  Zusak' s unconventional use of the language creates a book of startling power and impact.
 We read this for our book club and all loved it. None of us could remember reading a book from this perspective before; neither a book from the perspective of non-Jewish Germans during the Holocaust, nor from the perspective of Death.<br/><br/>Some of us didn't find out it was a Young Adult book until after we finished it, so don't let that turn you off. It has the depth of a book for adults. We felt that some of it will go over the heads of younger readers. Probably one of those things that we read several times during our lifetime to fully appreciate.
 "The Book Thief " captured me from the very first chapter! A great book containing history, drama and so much more. I am a lover of reading  ( have been reading since age 4) and am very diversified in what I like to read. This book was a page turner which made it difficult to put it down. I fully recommend "The Book Thief'"!  This has been made into a movie, however, I choose to read a book prior to seeing the movie as a book tends to go into much more detail. I doubt that anyone would be disappointed in reading "The Book Thief"!
 This was a wonderful book.  I don't have anything negative to say about it at all except towards the end I could see there wouldn't be a "happy ending" so to speak.  Not that the ending was bad, it just kind of got going downhill towards the end of the book and at some points, actually brought tears to my eyes.  Makes you really think of the "other side" of that dreadful war with the nazi's and the poor people in the middle, the germans.  But, I highly recommend this book.  It is a delightful read and I have to admit a couple of times I actually laughed out loud.  So between the laughter and the tears, read this book!
 there are a very few books that i will not lend out this is one of them.  I don't want anyone to touch or loose it.  Another book about someone who loves books about the places that they are needed in society. They joy and pleasure and information that books bring to us.  i personally love books so any time that i can read about someone who treasures books i just can't let them go. Historical fiction provides me a way to "enjoy" things or be aware of that happened before. So much pain and wrong that it's hard to continue reading.  So well written.  i chose this book because i'd seen it advertised and nothing more.  Boy did i get lucky.
 I gave this book 4 stars because it was entertaining, based on historical facts, kept me interested throughout and a very different take on life in Germany just before the WWII and shortly after. Great story lines regarding each character that you cannot help but become involved and interested in.<br/><br/>I can't think of anything I didn't like about the book. I love historical novels and this one is a winner. I didn't learn anything new regarding that time period but the story made all of the historical facts learned about this time period so much more real.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to anyone who likes history and a great story!
 If I only could read one book, I'd hope to pick up this book, just so I could read it again and again. It was not at all what I expected. I've read many European WWII stories, this is one of the most open rendering of that terrible time.<br/>Though I cringed and was ashamed to belong to the human race at times, I was also proud to be part of it. The style of writing, the viewpoint, the language, the insight into death all combined make this story ugly and beautiful at the same time. I could quote many passages, especially the ones crafted by death hold true today and in the future. These strung-together words will stay with me for a long time.
 This was a randomly picked book. I had initially picked it because it was on the best sellers list. I normally do not go by what others say to read. Mind you, I had no idea what this book was about. I find it interesting though how "ADULTS" which I am one, find it beneath them at times to read Young adult novels. I guess people just want to read about sex, murder, dysfunction junction crud.<br/> Anyhow I love a good young adult novel. However I don't think this is young adult...I think it is for adults. It took me re-reading the first chapter three times. I couldn't  figure out what in the heck it was talking about! When the light came on it was like " wow" this is a third persons take on this story. This book was written on how Death perceived the destruction of the German Nazis. This book was written how a girl lost everything, and how a kind loving man, who was a foster parent, nurtured her and gave her hope. A situation in which this foster family needed money to live, not nurture a broken girl. It was a love story on many counts, in a very indirect way. I could see and feel all of the characters in this book. My heart felt for the Jewish community and for these Germans who had to "fake" their loyalty to the rat bastard Hitler, for which they had to to survive. Heart wrenching , devastatingly, awesome  good read.
 When I had this book delivered to my new Kindle- I really didn't know what it was about, but at $5.00 the price was right.<br/><br/>I was immediately engulfed in the story...  reading late into the night and getting up earlier and earlier each morning to read before work.  I just could not put it down.  The entire time I was reading my heart felt like it was being pulled in two different directions...  Sad for all the people and events during WWII and hopefulness that love and kindness would prevail.  I was actually quite sad for a couple of days after I finished the book because I didn't want it to end.  The lesson I learned from this book has stayed with me much, much longer...  While it only takes one persons hateful words to grow a forest of hatred...  it also only takes one persons words to carve a path of hope.  Which one person will you be?
 Once you get past the first couple of chapters, you are into the book. I didn't find myself as enthralled with it in a "can't put it down" sense as other books. The narration by "Death" is a nice twist and once that I thoroughly enjoyed. The author's use of "asides" and captions about events and characters was charming.  The characters are described with such lovely metaphors that I found myself chuckling at the author's descriptions. I won't give spoilers, but I will say it was WAY better than the movie. I would enjoy more books from this author.
 I chose this rating mainly because I like the angle from which this author chose to write this story. I've read many stories from that era, but none quite as unique and the way this one was presented. It was a hard to put down read once I started it, but it was also a hard to read because of the story matter, but it was presented in such a way as to see the story from a different viewpoint as how relations could be formed during one of the most stressful times in history. The characters came to life as I read, and made an impact on the heart, and loved each and everyone and it was sad when the story ended to let them go. Great book and would recommend to anyone.
 A refreshing account of similar stories we know and have read. A horrible part of history enlightened with happy tales told by a very unique narrator throughout. It's great to read about the love and hope intertwined with such a horrific part of history. My only wish would have been for a slightly mire developed ending. The story built up great all throughout but ending came on too suddenly. That is probably only because I became so attached to the characters. Job well done. I will definitely read more by this inspiring author.
 This is such a powerful and wonderful novel! Though targeted towards children, this WWII-set novel definitely touches on some adult issues, and will undoubtedly appeal to both young and old readers. It's both a moving and beautiful story set within the height of the Nazi regime in Germany. Death as narrator sets the book out of the "typical" young adult novels to share this setting, and it works so sell here. I have actually read it a few times now, and the novel provides a wonderful springboard for discussion, making it a wonderful choice for use in both classrooms and book clubs. It sounds strange to say, but upon re-reading it, I really savored the strength and beauty of Zusak's writing - that appeared all the more wonderful juxtaposed against the brutality of his setting. I am looking forward to reading more of this talented author's work!
 This book is narrated by "Death" during a time when there is no rest for the weary. Death is weary in wartime Germany collecting dead communists, socialists, Jews and many others who oppose the Nazis. The story is of a little girl whose parents were left wingers rounded up and probably gassed among the rest. She cannot read but grabs a book out of the flames of a book burning. It happens to be a grave diggers manual. The child is gathered in, adopted by a really kindly man and his taciturn, mean mouthed  wife with what turns out to be a heart of gold. This family takes in a protects a Jewish young man, Max.  Liesel Meminger, the little girl begins to learn to read the words in her stolen book. Her foster father patiently helps her learn. The Jewish young man Max also reads to her. She steals books from the Nazi book burnings and from the library of the Mayor's wife who leaves a window open so that the child can come and go. The story proceeds with death getting busier and busier yet although the story leaves you with tears there is a glimmer of hope and joy because you learn that although people you love in the story die, others survive and their precious  lives go on.
 Started reading this because I saw a preview of the soon to be released film they made from this book. The book was really good. It had such a different perspective coming from the words of the grim reaper ( death). Good story. Depressing but heart warming at the same time. I liked it. It follows the story of a handful of German citizens during WW1 and gives us an insight as to what the citizens of Germany went through during this time. Not everyone from Germany supported Hitler and what he was doing to the Jewish population. This is a little story about some of those Germans and how they coped and the tremendous difficulties they also faced.
 If you're looking for a "light summer read" this is not the book for you. This book has a lot of detail and history. I thought it was a great story and gave some insight to what it was like to be a German in WWII. I loved how the relationships developed throughout the story. It is a little slow to start, but picks up towards the middle when "the visitor" arrives. the ending was great - it leaves you with closure, but at the same time wondering some things. Definitely worth reading!
 I had ordered the book to read at the same time as my niece - required for summer reading. It was not hard for me to get into (some have made that remark), but had to adjust to the "voice" narrating the story. fascinating perspective and powerful story.
 I really enjoyed this book. It made me realize just  how extremely fortunate I am not to have been raised in Nazi Germany during the WWII era. The author was able  to reach down and grab at many emotions. Happiness and  extreme sadness<br/> Liesel the book thief shows that it  is possible  for anyone to triumph over the difficult times in their lives. As she had to with the death of her brother, being placed in foster care by her mother, food rationing,  and just trying to survive day to day. During one of the worlds most difficult times<br/>I think this is a book that everyone should read much like the diary  of Anne Frank. So we will all realize what we the world must never allow to happen again
 The Book Thief is eloquently written;it is like an epic poem. It moved me more than any book I have read in a very long time. I have read many stories about the Holocaust, and watched many documentaries, in an attempt to understand how such horror could have happened. There is something in this book that did that. I really cared about the characters and found myself tearing up when bad things happened to them. Even though the main character is an adolescent girl, this book is not for children. I would recommend it for high school age and up and I hope it is on high school reading. Casting Death as the narrator was brilliant.
 Liesel, Papa, Mama, Max, and a lemon haired boy named Rudy...and Death as the narrator in this sad yet redeeming tale of humanity from the view of the lovely young  Liesel in Nazi Germany during WWII.<br/>I wanted to read this book before going to see the movie made from the story.  Somehow I know that even if the movie is good and true to the book, the book will have been better.  It was hard to put the book down.  Sometimes the break started in laughter and at the end in tears.<br/>The story is sad, inspiring, heartbreaking, and wonderful. I recommend it for anyone who likes history linked stories...just keep the Kleenex close at hand.
 I selected this book after all the hype of the movie, and without fully realizing it was a "young adult" book. So at first I found the writing too simplistic. Once I got past that, though, the power of the story reeled me in. Not many reviewers have commented on the larger arc of the story, which is that tyranny creates rabid supporters who are more than willing to destroy the lives of untold numbers of people to enforce their utopian vision. And this willingness to do violence also creates heroes and heroines who are willing to risk their lives to oppose that tyranny.<br/><br/>My hope is that this is the message that reverberates in a time when the world almost everywhere is drifting into authoritarian rule.
 Incredible book! Markus Zusak hooks the reader from the start. He writes so beautifully about a sad,emotional topic told through the story of Leisal.I was so taken by his use of similes and personifications,I had  to write several  down to savor from time to time.<br/>  At times, I wanted to stop reading this book<br/>With the reality of Nazi Germany and its horrors but I was hooked on seeing how death was viewing things.<br/>I had to see how Leisal resolved her struggles.  A Book has always been a constant companion for many of us in all kinds of trials and tribulations.  And death awaits us and watches the play.
 This book is like a symphony of words. The story is wonderfully told and the language is some of the most lovely I have encountered in some time. The characters are well-crafted and the story straight-forward in its beauty and simplicity. I enjoyed reading about World War II from a different perspective. The book incorporates some drawing and interesting inner storytelling, too, that I found original and refreshing. The book is way better than the movie, so if you saw the movie and weren't impressed, forget you saw it and read the book. Then you will be impressed.
 When I first stated it, for almost the first 15%, I wondered why I was reading a book about Germany during the reign of Hitler.  It seemed that everyone was too cruel etc.<br/><br/>Then I started connecting to the warm, loving characters who could see the wrong and I started to love them.<br/><br/>The characters are beautifully developed, the sharp edges of the whole situation are so well defined.  The author paints a beautiful picture.  He writes metaphorically and his metaphors are most apt and expressive.<br/><br/>It was a time of heartbreak and human ugliness as the Jews were hunted and hidden.  It is representational in how many "humans" can stand by and watch something so evil.<br/><br/>This book takes one to a time in the world's history when nothing was as it should have been.  It is painful, but should make us each more acutely aware of the danger of allowing others to influence our actions.<br/><br/>A lesson in how beautiful a person becomes when he shows compassion and love to those who are in need, repressed, and/or tortured.<br/><br/>Read the book! but beware the subject matter!
 The author clearly makes it known he is writing from stories he heard from his grandparents rather than personal experience.  Yet he captures the very essence of the stories told by those who were there.  Even though it is fiction, it has the loud ring of truth throughout.  And he demonstrates a true understanding of the real issues of 'bullies' and 'victims'.  Watershed is usually used in a completely different context, yet the 'watershed' moment for me, literally, was his description of a Jewish man who died knowing someone had looked at him and recognized another human being.  The lesson here is the tragedy of the millions who died NOT knowing anyone considered them truly human.
 This book is appropriate for all ages, both genders, and every stratum of society. The dictum is that whoever we are and wherever we come from,we share the same emotions, sorrows,and fears. While there are flashes of evil with regard to the treatment of the Jews in Nazi Germany, the over-arching message is that people are basically good and care about their fellow man. The protagonist, Liesl, is such a caring,loving person, that one does not condemn her book thieving. In fact, the reader wishes her success in these endeavors. All of the characters are brilliantly drawn and so alive that you feel that you are in their presence.<br/>The structure of the book is very well designed and paced to keep the reader turning the pages. While it is narrated by Death,the reaper of souls, it is not lugubrious. It is a novel approach to dealing with the carnage in World War II Germany. The denouement comes quickly in the final pages and is an unexpected ending to a powerful book.
 I love reading. To me the writing is more important than the story, and I am very picky. Books that I have loved include "The Lovely Bones" by Alice Sebold, and "The Poisonwood bible" by Barbara Kingslover. The Book Thief is such a wonderful example of innovative and meaningful writing. Markus Zusak treats us to a unique style of his own, and brings wartime Germany to us from the perspective of a German non-Jewish girl, but told by Death. You don't get much more unique than that. However, if you do not appreciate poetic writing you may not enjoy this book or its style. All I can say after reading it, though, is wow!
 I found this book to be a bit confusing to start; however, It was difficult to put down.  The more I read, the more I wanted to read.  It puts the reader in the middle of a pre-war and war-torn German town, centering particularly on a young girl.  And that's all I'll say about the content, because I don't want to spoil it for anyone.  This book gives true insight as to the life of a German family during this time in history.  It's tragic, funny, heart-wrenching, brings you fully into the day-to-day life of the times.  Loved the book and would recommend its purchase for perhaps a little older reader, maybe 20's and up, but definitely worth the read.
 Not sure why I kept reading this book, because at first I wasn't that interested. It must be a sign of a very good, if not great, writer to capture someone's interest until the end, esp when they're not sure why they chose it. Then of course I became curious and involved, and couldn't stop reading it every night before bed. I even took it on a vacation to a tropical island when I knew it wasn't going to be a fun, romantic read. But here I am having finished it poolside and now reviewing it! All I can say is it's a lot about WW1 told from a poor German's view point , along with a great story told thru a child's eye. Would highly recommend this book...but maybe not on vacation! LOL.
 This book is not only about death, but told by the perspective of death. It has a very intriguing appeal the way death speaks to the reader as if they are there too. The focus of death are on the holocaust and a girl, a girl who catches the eye of death, forcing it to remember people instead of just colors.<br/> In the book, death associates people with colors “Yes, it was white. It felt as though the whole globe was dressed in snow” (Zusak pg.6). It doesn’t like to focus on the people left behind, only the colors that were there as it took each soul. However, the first time it came across Liesel Meminger it couldn’t help but to focus on her while holding the soul it had been there to collect. Twice after that over the years, it was there to collect souls around Liesel, and each time it remembered who she was and was in awe just watching her and learning about her story, as a book thief.<br/> The way that death plays the role of speaking for the story offers a very different perspective on the book rather than if Liesel had told it herself. The whole story is unfolded to the reader in a way that no other character could have done. Of course, the book has a dark twist to it; however, it portrays death as matter of fact, “You will know me well enough and soon enough, depending on a diverse range of variables. It suffices to say that at some point in time, I will be standing over you, as genially as possible. Your soul will be in my arms. A color will be perched on my shoulder. I will carry you gently away” (Zusak pg. 4).<br/> The setting is during the holocaust, time jumps forward a few years at times, but death is always prevalent and recurring in this area all around Liesel. Starting at the beginning of Liesel’s story she finds a book, of all things, that changes her life. After this she develops a habit of stealing books from where ever she can find them, she’d get them from the Nazi book burnings, and libraries, and anywhere she could manage to take a book without being noticed.<br/> I absolutely love the way this book is written, and the way focus is put on items usually perceived as insignificant to a human, like the colors, the stories, and the calmness in death. A person who believes death is nothing to grieve over would probably be seen as crazy in most people’s eyes, crazy, or profound. However, since death is telling everyone’s story we are more able to understand how death is so absolute and inevitable. Although I was only 13 going on 14 while reading this book, it really spoke to me, and now, four years later this is still by far one of my favorite reads.
 I have always wanted to read this book because the movie looked good and I have to say it was a great book but with sad parts because this was world war II. Some parts did confuse me because I couldn't find out who was narrating the story.<br/><br/>I don't know if you find out what happens to the mother because you know the brother dies on the train and is buried.<br/><br/>The ending had me crying because she finds out that the street was bomb and Rudy and her adopted parents are died. Her saying goodbye was so sad because she tries to wake them up.<br/><br/>It was a great story and think everyone should read it.
 This book is about love war death and the injustice and sorrow of the world.<br/>A rather depressing combination, however, there is some ray of hope in the love between father and daughter, mother and child, and a forlorn German Jewish refugee harbored by a German family in WW2.<br/>There is also a touching account of a young German boy and girl growing up in Munich during the war stealing apples and their deep friendship.<br/>The book is narrated by Death.<br/>He turns out to be the grim but somewhat compassionate reaper/author narrator of the story.<br/>This is a very moving tale.<br/>Liesel Memminger, the book thief, is a true tragic heroine.
 The perils of Nazi Germany may gave affected the Jews directly and horrificly.  But the Nazis did no favors for the German people either.  This book tells how the common people were adversely affected, through false pride, false promises and torture of people once loved, then reviled.  The horrors of war are covered in detail about a young girl and her painful journey through her young years.  Terrifying at times, repugnant in nature, and full of sorrow, there is still love, binding friendship, empathy and forgiveness.
 I read this book during the Christmas season.  It is very interesting and death being the narrator is unique.  The great depression is a time of hoplesness and despair for some and yet others find ways of overcoming the darkness.  Even though this is fiction it is very believable.  It is during Hitler's regime and in a time when people actually followed the Natzi propaganda.  My highest ranking book is Corrie Ten Boomes book, the Hiding Place and the Hiding Place is based on a true story of Hitler and his concentration camps.  Even though this book is fictional it has me thinking the families are real.  This may be my next favorite book.
 I  really enjoyed this book because I particularly like historical fiction.  The characters had unique personalities that were very believable.  I learned a lot about. NAZI Germany, not much I didn't already know, but told from the girl's perspective.  I recommended it to my sister and she said she did not like it and was not going to finish it.  I question it as a Young Adult book, unless it would be for a history class In high school.  I have not seen the movie but would like to now that I've Read the book.  I can just imagine the cellar and Mac's cubby since we had one where I lived growing up.  I do recommend this book.
 I loved loved loved this book.  I was THERE in the town of Molching with Leisel through every page, saw, smelt, and tasted everything with her.  The interesting twist on the narration was fantastic and has left me thinking of that ever since!  I love a book that leave me yearning to learn more, to read more.  I thought I had read everything I could about Nazi Germany.  No.  This is a whole new perspective.  This led me to read a non-fiction Wanted: the search for nazis in America by Howard Blum.<br/><br/>Even though this was made into a motion picture, don't 'just see the movie' READ THE BOOK.  The book is so rich and almost a different story.  Worth your time.  I recommend this book to everyone.
 Most stories relating to Hitler and the devastation to the Jewish people give a look at the horror from the Jewish point of view. This story is different, and in many ways make the inhumanity of man sadder and more diverse. The story is narrated by the voice of Death as he travels the earth collecting souls. The main characters are a little german girl who loves to read (and steal books) her family, friends and community-- all of whom are affected by the madness, greed and power of Hitler. This is a story about the people who were powerless to change the direction of history; yet in their small way, this German family,with great courage, took in and hid a Jewish male in their basement. The poverty and fear felt by this German community was directly related to Hitler's march to power. The relationships between the characters is authentic, passionate, and exceedingly interesting. The overall feeling is one of understanding how we are all connected and nothing happens to only one group that does not spill over into all other groups.
 For me, this book is a 5-star book for the following reasons: it really moved me and made me feel a myriad of emotions, it tought me important historic lessons, it made me contemplate the reality of my own life, it gave me courage to face my own challenges, and it has not been able to leave me. This book, in a good way, haunts me!<br/><br/>The unique narrator (Death) makes the passages profound and philosophical and the result is a book that takes some time to read. The plot line and the interesting characters make you want to finish the book quickly but the reader should take the time to read it, especially in those moments when the narrator expresses some universal truths about our humanity. At times, I would read a line and gasp to myself "Death is saying this". It was a wonderful experience to read this.
 Enter The Book Thief. She made an impression on me, this book, when I read her in 2014. It is a quiet book. A gentle book. A large, heft of a book. But, still it pressed down on me and left its mark. Zusak has a way with words that reminds me of a snake charmer. It's hypnotic in its simplicity. He can take a simple scene, break it down to geometry, substance, and color, and some how in that description, with Death as the narrator, the beauty is apparent. Even the beauty of the ugly and tarnished. He is a word shaker, too.<br/><br/>The story of Liesel Meminger is, perhaps, not a unique one. Anne and her diary, of course, came before her, and Anne was real where Liesel is not. And yet, Zusak brings her to life, inflated with the lives of all the others who were real and like her. Anne is in there. The Book Thief reminds us that we are all human, we are all good and bad, we are all, essentially, waiting for Death to come for us, too.
 I found this book to be  hauntingly beautiful and inspiring.  When I was a girl I had a ceramic plaque on my wall that read "There is not enough darkness in all the world to put out the light of one small candle".  That one small candle shone brightly through every page of this book and even the darkest, most terrifying events of the Nazi war machine could not snuff out its glow.  I was often moved to tears as love was chosen over hate, courage over fear and hope over despair.  As Victor Frankl showed  in "Man's Victorious Spirit", there is something in each of us that is bigger than our worst nightmare.  Do yourself a favor and read and savor this wonderful book.
 I've read other reviews that have criticized Marcus Zusak's style of writing, comparing it to others and dismissing the book as it similarities in writing styles nullifies the books worth.  This story is so beautiful.  I don't care at all about the style.  The fact remains that the story of a horrific event from a young girls viewpoint opens our eyes to a a side of Hitlers' Germany that isn't often seen.  That being a German did not automatically mean you were in favor of Nazism, and points out the fear and poverty that even Germans lived with.  No one dared not support the Fuhrer, for you were then a Jew lover!  I am 48 years old, for my generation Christian Germans have been lumped into being pro-Nazism.  This story paints a vivid picture of a life of poverty, a time of strange things happening with no questions asked years of loss and pain that were endured by most of Germany.  I fell in love with Leisel, Max, Papa, Mama, Rudy and even Frau Holtapfel for their ability to still love, give, laugh and find happiness in a life I can't even imagine.  I found this to be a beautiful story in human tenacity and a superb history lesson.  I would recommend this being material for junior high and high school literature classes.  Thank you Marcus, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.
 Good story told from an unlikely, but rather interesting viewpoint. Enjoyed reading and was sad to see the story come to its conclusion.
 This is one of my favorite books.  The story takes place in Eastern Europe in the late 30's, with the rise of the Nazi Party as a backdrop.  Don't be put off by the fact that it is narrated by Death.  He carries the souls of the dead to heaven, and he has some choice things to say about the stupidity of the human race.  The main character, the book thief, is a brave girl who tries to do her best and protect her friends and foster parents in an angry and violent environment.  She will always be one of my heroines.
 At first the writer's approach was a little hard to get around - i.e. using chapter summaries at the begging of each chapter, narration by "Death", giving away plot elements before they happen - but this is brilliant writing. I found some of the horrors the characters faced during WWII hard to take, but it is an important historical perspective of what war really is and should never be forgotten if world peace is ever to be achieved. The fact that the characters are German, non-Jewish children, makes this more compelling.
 this book was amazing! I was first told to read this by my ninth grade english teacher with whom I still keep in touch. she had told me of this "extremely clever and well written novel" and that up had to read it before I (ironically) die. (considering that the book is narrated by the character of death itself) I thought I would give it a shot, so I went to my local library and asked the librarian  where I could find a copy of this novel. there was not a copy in sight. my library had 30 copies and every single one was checked out. I then ( no pun intended) booked it to my local Barnes and noble and found a copy, I was shocked when I picked up what seemed more like a paper weight than a book (it's almost 600 pages) . I had asked the bookseller why this novel was all of a sudden so popular, and I was told it was being made into a movie, that was coming out in a few weeks. so as soon as I got home I turned to the first page. three days later I was finished, and was so deeply moved by the ending of this book that the pages were stained with tears ( I'm a 17 year old guy I rarely cry but lo and behold I cried). I thought at the beginning that nothing could come of a 600 hundred page book cause I thought you can't really have that much to say on one topic. it didn't feel like I read a 600 hundred page book in 3 days it felt like I was watching this true story (in which it is not) unfold before my eyes on the page. I absolutely love this incredibly witty yet deeply moving book. I would recommend this and the relatively well adapted movie version (naturally things were cut, it would have been a 12 hour film if everything was left in.) the important plot points were left in and kept the integrity of this story told by death, alive.
 this is the best book ever. ok, well, maybe not THE best but it is freaking fabulous and i love it. other reviews have gone more in depth, so this review is a shameless 5 star bump.<br/>for reference, i like all kinds of books - pride and prejudice, game of thrones, the bronze horseman trilogy, harry potter, twilight. this book was an easy read and captivating. i cried, laughed and have read it several times since i originally bought it. i moved overseas and didn't take any books with me, thought my kindle would suffice, but after i decided to stay forever i needed to buy my favourite books again, and this was one of them.
 Thoughts on The Book Thief: this book is the most unique story I've read in a long while. The narrator is a rare individual that we all will encounter at some point in our lives. The setting is in Germany during the horrific times of World War 2. And, as the main character encounters a tragic childhood, there are beautiful redeeming threads intertwined, resulting in a story that is most difficult yet filled with love &amp; kindness &amp; tenderness that shine in the midst of the nightmare. The beauty of the human spirit overshadows the atrocities of war. I would recommend it highly.
 This book is astounding, and it probably ties for my favorite book, along with Les Miserables. I loved reading a WWII book set in Germany, because our view of Germans at that time is typically very one-sided, but there was courage and honor there too in the hearts of brave individuals who risked their lives to do what was right. The book itself is narrated by death, which makes for an achingly beautiful story. A life viewed in the lens of death is not dark, but rather thoughtful and peaceful. I fell in love with all of the characters, especially Hans Hubermann (Papa) who is described as having a brute strength of gentleness, and reminds me of my own sweet Papa. I found a kindred spirit in Liesel, who falls in love with books and words, and I adored Max, who found a way to live and inspire others, even in dreadful circumstances. Young Rudy had so much courage and independence, and Rosa had a huge heart, despite a battering of words that would suggest otherwise. The book presents some interesting themes to ponder, such as what constitutes good and evil, when breaking the law is acceptable and right, the ambiguity of morality, and the power of words.  The prose is also beautiful, and I found myself highlighting phrases that were both poetic and profound. This book wrecked my heart, but I have never been so happy to have my heart shattered. The characters and words will stay with you long beyond the last page.
 Without a doubt one of the most lyrical and beautifully written books I have ever read, and I have been an English teacher for a very long time.  The language, word choices and descriptors take your breath away.  A stunning novel!  The horrors of war have happened to many, many people, but never have I read them described with such a perfect control of language, adjectives used in unexpected ways that at first take the reader by surprise, but after thinking about it for a moment, one realizes that the selected word is absolutely perfect and manages to convey much, much more than the word the reader expected.  A beautiful story about a terrifying time.
 Quite an unusual book. Death, the narrator, has "a thing" for colors  -"...your soul will be in my arms. A color will be perched on my shoulders."  "rain like gray pencil shavings", "eyes like pale blue cutouts pasted on her face."  There were descriptions, turn-of-phrases most unusual, like "...a refrigerated voice," "coat-hanger arms," and"a bathrobe answered the door." Although it is stated that this book was not. about the holocaust, that piece of history is part of its backbone and it was always in my vision. A book so appreciated I don't really plan on the movie.
 This was a great story about a young girl coming of age during the Nazi occupation of Germany.  She is an orphan who comes to live with a German couple and feels all alone in the world.  Her new momma is somewhat harsh, but you learn that she actually does have a heart.  Her new poppa is so kind to her and helps her improve her reading skills.  It really makes you stop and think about how the Nazi situation affected so many people who were really just trying to live a peaceful life - even if they were not Jewish.
 I've often wondered what life was like in Nazi Germany during WWII for people who weren't members of the Nazi party. Though not the center of the story, it's especially well addressed through the character Hans, the book thief's father. I also saw the film and was amazed how faithfully it reflected the 'sense' of the story. Clips from the film are effectively used at intervals in the ebook as 'illustrations' of the action. The author brings the characters into life with all their complexities shown. I could readily understand them and found them totally believable as if the author were describing events he had lived through. I found the ending bitter-sweet but approximate for the horrors of war. Zusak, the author, does not spare the reader some grim realities.
 I never thought there could ever be another side of a story of Nazism, but I really enjoyed the Book Thief. It made me realized how Hitler's ideology affected his own people especially the poor Germans.<br/><br/>To see a story like this through the eyes of children who find themselves in such a situation shows that they  are capable of adjusting to the most trying situation.<br/><br/>You know most would like to believe that death has a story because they had been taught to believe so, maybe it's a way to cope with death.  Maybe the author could had chose a different narrator. Despite this the book was very good, I highly recommend it and now I`m ready to see the movie.
 And at the same time eerie when the author incorporates death as the fictional narrator...this was unsettling.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, "Book Thief" is a compelling read of war torn Germany during WWII with a young foster girl as the main character whose obsession was words and books. Her passion for books is what led to her thievery...she could not get enough.<br/><br/>Zusak masters words himself in this edge of your seat novel...descriptive, colorful and intricate. His graphic details of the holocaust are shocking, and the development of storyline is original and very ingenious.<br/><br/>A spellbinding read.
 I like the unusual narrator of this book. The writing was fluid like paint on a smooth canvass with a soft brush, colorful, evocative and sense catching. The showcase of the "enemy" trying to live through a war they didn't ask for, the suffering of all throughout, though sad, was uplifting. It shows that everyone on both sides have strong feelings of right and wrong. The young girl and her friends, family and neighbors pull us into their experience with them as we share their lives in full. I recommend this book to everyone and now I can't wait to see what's been done with the movie.
 A beautifully written narration of how families lived and survived in frightening circumstances, but still maintained a sense of love and compassion for one another. It illustrated how children can go about daily living in the worst of times and still be children.  Having been a small child during WWII ,about the same age as Liesel, growing up in the United States, with my father in the service, my pregnant mother, grandmother and 2 aunts all living together in the same house, I can relate to how your family can shelter you from the real horrors of war and still let your childhood have good moments with friends and family.  This is a book you want to read more than once.
 A very good book. And considering the time it is set in, not just sad, but rather a story of hope. Of what it means to be human in times that are terrible. From the start, you will root for the protagonist and want to know how the story unfolds and ends, even when Markus put's in some purposefully placed "spoilers" that in essence are not spoilers at all. Just a very unique way in driving the story forward. Read this either just for entertainment, or to better understand how ordinary people lived and suffered during the Third Reich, or as a story about humanism and the reason for living. Then read it again, and just marvel at how artfully Markus Zusak has crafted this story, often breaking with convention on how stories should be told, not for show effect, but to get the reader to a much deeper level of understanding, of feeling with the characters, of understanding what led to all the evil and misery on one hand and all the love and bravery on the other hand that people showed in those dark times.
 I give this book 5  stars because of how beautiful and ordinary, dismal and extraordinary, sweet and engaging it is. The author takes a piece of history and delivers an unusual interpretation of the events. The narrator has seen seen the beauty and tragedies that afflict humans, yet he is haunted and mesmerized by a young girl who learns to read. The new words she learns take her everywhere and she devours books. For those of us who love the written word, this book is one of the ultimate treasures in life. The author writes so beautifully, you feel like you are with our young heroine, experiencing all of her discoveries of life. WOW....fantastic!!!!!!
 I've been teaching this book for 4 years (to 8th graders) and it remains one of my favorites of all time!  Very different with "Death" narrating as a sympathetic, compassionate spirit.  The prologue can be confusing but don't let it turn you off--it's Death being quirky and subtly sarcastic, and it's foreshadowing.  Love all the characters: Rudy and Liesel's true friendship is unique and adorable.  Hans is a good soul.  Even Rosa makes me laugh.  I always need a box of tissues toward the end.  The movie doesn't do the book justice (although, it was pretty good). Read this book and pass it on to everyone you know!!
 My 17 year old had to read this for Freshman Honors English summer reading a few years ago, so I decided to get the ebook &amp; read it too.  I reallly loved the book &amp; watched the move as well.  When my 14 year old needed it for her summer reading this year, I decided to buy her a copy of her own, so she can have it for years to come.  This is a classic that will continue to be a good solid read in the future.
 From another point of view, The Book Thief kept me up at night reading until I fell asleep, catching small glimpses of happiness amid a lot of sadness. This story takes you on a roller coaster. The telling of the story is unique in its format. An original that keeps your attention, creating what feels like an accurate portrayal of events from that point in history from the life of the main character. The events from world war ii in Germany, while horrible, are the backdrop for a story of human suffering and human mercy that make the reader think hard, long after finishing. I can see why a movie was created from the story.
 I'd give this more of a 3 1/2 stars but can't split the values.  It was a good story, but told very slowly.  The use of the grim reaper as narrator was clever, but the tone throughout was very drear.  Of course the historical setting could only yield a dreary story.  Zusak weaves a tense story of people caught up in the horrors of Hitler's Reich and has garnered 1000s of positive reviews.  I just didn't find it as good a read as Sarah's Key, or Shades of Gray (not 50 shades of gray by the way!)
 I was enthralled through almost every page of this book.  The writer has such a unique style.  His writing is filled with words that say so much about life and death. The characters come alive on the pages.  I loved the drawings and his description of things.  The book was our Book Club choice for August.  I can hardly wait to get to that meeting and discuss this wonderful book.
 Enjoyable book.  I loved the concept of Death as a narrator and was fascinated by his use of color to describe each encounter with him.  The characters were well defined with easy to follow story lines.  The author used guilt, irony, and love as tools for showing the complexity of life and the relationships we form along the way.  I was reminded while reading this novel that love comes in all shapes and forms and it's up to us to stop and notice it.  Although the backdrop for this novel is one of great sadness and loss, the author didn't dwell on that but kept the reader focused on the good in people.  For instance every little girl should be lucky enough to have a father as loving and kind as Hans.  What a big heart he had!  It was a pleasure to read.
 This book isn't going to be the easiest read you'll ever pick up.  To begin it's narrated by death and as you might guess, death has a lot more to tell you about than just the simple facts.  The tale follows a little girl (the book thief, herself) as she grows up in Nazi Germany--so if you're looking for light, fluffy material this isn't the best choice for you.<br/><br/>There are a lot of stories about the holocaust, so many touching stories, but Zusak does a remarkable job of making this one personal.  It's focus on this one little girl who steals books long before she knows how to read them makes the pain and suffering of the holocaust that much closer to us.<br/><br/>Zusak's writing style is ruthlessly beautiful and haunting.  He even has his deathly narrator warn you in advance of exactly what will happen and tells you not blame *him* when you're upset. And then when the big painful moments come, you don't blame the narrator, but you can't help but shed some tears and ache a bit.  The writing in this book is eloquent, the pacing is perfect and the characters will stay with you long after you've reached the last page.  If you're looking for a book that you'll remember long after you're done with it, this is a must read for you.
 I'd never read a book written quite like this.  At first I questioned if I really liked this book, not realizing that I was hooked.  The characters are so vivid, so real!  The viewpoint of the German living in their beloved country under the control of a maniac, and under whose regime they had to struggle to find hope in life and humanity was humbling.  I read the last page, closed the book and said, "WOW"!!!!!!  Good job cone, Zusak.  You took me by surprise.  I loved it as a "lone" reader, but would highly recommend it to book clubs, because it leaves you wanting to "discuss" with others.
 I wont go into great detail here as there are thousands of reviews.  I will say that most of the 1 and 2 star reviews are based on people who didnt finish the book and many who only read a chapter or two.  It is 500 pages and in the beginning a little daunting, but stick with it.  It is one of the finest books I have ever read.  It is the kind of book that after you finish, you cant stop thinking about.  I gave it to my husband and 15 year old son to also read and they loved it too.  Amazing book, incredible story, beautifully written.
 I don't think I have read a book with such amazing storytelling in a very long time.  The characters capture you from the start and the way the book weaves together is exceptional. This story played out in my head exactly like a movie. If you are looking for  light read I would not recommend. The plot is deeply routed in the harsh times of Nazi Germany and it does not shy away from the truths that were very present then. With that said I think that so many aspects of the story keep your heart light and open for the greater good in the human race.
 The spare story-telling style in The Book Thief was, to me, perfect for describing the horrors endured by the characters. Every so often throughout the book there are bits of prose that would knock me back in their beauty. The author's use of only a few words to paint a picture is amazing. Frankly I'm sad to see that they're turning this book into a movie. Part of the wonderful-ness of this book is the tapestry of words used to give meaning to events that were overwhelming in their brutality. Interestingly, I had no idea this was a "young adult" novel until I read other reviews. That designation is completely irrelevant with this book.
 I do not know what prompted me to order this book, but I was not disappointed.  This was one of the best books I have read in recent years.  The Book Thief has a bit of an unorthodox approach to telling the story, but after I got used to hearing from Death as the narrator, I could not put the book down.  Set in Germany prior to and during World War II, Markus Zusak weaves a riveting story of a girl, a family, a town and a culture that draws on every emotion imaginable.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is as thought provoking as it is entertaining and I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in reading about the war years from an unusual perspective.
 I am proud to be a be able to say that I loved this book.with all the  humour and the pathos and  tragedy  it was a  life affirming experience for me.  I realised some people cannot be corrupted by evil and that there  were Germans who hated Hitler and were compassionate to Jews.<br/><br/> The author has drawn Rudy and Liesel as two kids on the brink of maturity who lived, laughed and cried during the most horrible time in human history.  Hans and Rosa's characters refuse to be changed by the evil around them as they shelter a Jew .  The part where Hans gives crumbs of bread to a starving Jew will remain in my mind forever, and the fact that this act of kindness influences Liesel and Rudy to drop crumbs along the path to Dauchau  despite the danger to them.<br/><br/>I loved this book with a passion.  the author is a wordsmith and the fact that Death is the narrator of the story makes it all the more compelling.
 This is one of the best books I have read on quite some time! You almost feel as you almost know the characters personally. An emotionally charged book that grabs you from the first page!
 I honestly have to say I picked this book up after, of the two newest movies set to hit theaters, and this was one...make their debut. To witness the adaptation from book to movie when it is good and not just thrown together. It gives its own sort of narrative that I enjoy. There is the most to say about this book that was like a less tedious diary of Anne Frank, and told with a "lean on me" kind of flair. I enjoyed immensely and will not be like some of the other reviewers and end here...minus the spoiler alert.
 I just finished it.<br/>I literally "ate" it, i could not put it down. Besides being beautifully written, in such an original, poetic and evocative way, it's just...well...beautiful. Such an incredibly beautiful story. So much beauty in times of darkness, so much strength and hope and courage, so much humanity. The characters are incredible, one by one, so real and full of life - Zusak made an incredibly wonderful job bringing them to life.<br/>It's just such an emotional book.<br/>Very powerful.<br/><br/>I cried like a baby and i do believe that this story and these characters will stay with me for a very long time.<br/>This book goes straight in my "favorites" shelf.<br/><br/>If you haven't read it yet, just do yourself a favour...READ IT.
 When I first began reading, it took a few minutes to understand who the narrator was.  The entire book was gripping and I became totally immersed in Nazi Germany.  Thank you Mr. Zusak for sharing this book with the world.  People are so like sheep and will follow anyone with the right words.  Pray this doesn<br/>t happen in our beloved America, whose children are selfish and self-centered, caring only about their own desires and comfort, not caring for their friends or neighbors except at Christmastime.  How can we stand by and watch such human suffering?  May there always be those who would offer bread to the starving and be willing to suffer the consequences.
 This is a very interesting story. I love the characters, setting, and the author's creative way with words. I've never read a book from death's point of view. I read so many books it's hard to find one that can surprise and delight with its uniqueness. The only drawback is the blasphemy. Seems like the author could have been creative enough to find other words to use when characters curse. This is supposed to be a book young adults can read. Because of the blaspheme, which the author himself refers to in the book, I cannot recommend this book to my students.
 I know this has been a very well received and loved book.  I can well understand the importance and impact of it, but I found it cumbersome to read.  Finished about 300 pages, but couldn't continue. Although the subject matter is realistically grim and oppressive-I thought there needed to be a bit more light in the writing.
 Twenty more words required. Twenty more words required. Twenty more words required. Twenty more words required. Twenty more words required. Twenty more words required. Isn't this stupid?
 What "grabbed me from the get-go" was the way this book was written.  His writing style is as compelling as the story itself.  His  descriptions throughout the book, make the scene jump off the page like a photograph.  The colors, the smells, the devastation, you see it, you smell it, and you live it. It was easy to "see" the story.  I loved how "death" was a narrator.  Seeing the written words through the eyes of the grim reaper, was such a brilliant addition to the story. This book both moved me to tears, and made me laugh. It is a difficult read at times, yet heartwarming too. I absolutely loved it.  It's a must read. I have not seen the movie, but I think I'll watch it at home so I can cry in private!
 I loved the story, but the format threw me off, somewhat.  I thought I'd adjust by the time the book ended; I didn't. Until the very last word, I was uncomfortable with the format.  Even now, I don't see the purpose of the format - it didn't really enhance the story and because it seemed irrelevant, it was a distraction.  It's a personal preference; I have friends who were not put off by the format and friends, like me, who were.
 This was one of those books you can't put down, but hate for it to end. If you know your WWII history or even if it all comes as a big surprise to you, what went on in Germany will make your heart cry as this story is told wonderfully. It was nice to see the story from the inside and death really does have an inside view to all.<br/><br/>The reason I got the book was to see if it would be fitting for our ten year old granddaughter to read. I'm going to wait for a few years, but it will be one we will be getting for her. It's a book that ALL teens need to read and know this story.<br/><br/>To anyone who is on the fence about this book...jump. You will be glad you did.
 This is the haunting account of one child's incredible life in Germany during WW 2.  It is filled with characters throughout in the true sense of the word!<br/><br/>Be prepared to laugh, to cry and to wonder at the resilience and the evil of humanity!<br/><br/>This is a book EVERYONE should read!  May The Book Thief's words propel each reader toward being the best person they are meant to be!<br/><br/>May all inhumanity cease in our world.  May we learn from our shared histories.  And at the end of our lives may we rise from our bodies ready and accepting.
 Clearly one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It is a back story in one of the worlds darkest hours as we experience the unfolding of Nazi horrors through the eyes of the children. The story is a reminder that there are a million stories from that era that we will never read about. This one is a gift. We watch as the beliefs and thought processes of the children are forever formed by the gradual unveiling of world events condensed down to their small corner of the world.
 Although it took a bit of reading to understand what was going on, I did get hooked on the story. It is the first fictional account that I have read of someone who lived through Nazi Germany as a German citizen. I don't want to give too much away, but once you realize who the narrator is, you find quite an interesting perspective from him as well as Liesel, the Book Thief. It is a good read, with substance and heart.
 Anyone who loves books will love this one. As another reviewer has said, there's no need to go into the plot here as that is apparent by now, but those avid readers who habitually lose themselves in a book, can identify - at least in a small way - with the little girl who loses herself in books to escape hunger, poverty, death and the other hardships of war. She also uses books to not only feed her own soul but the souls of neighbors as they huddle in crowded bomb shelters, and the soul of the young Jewish man hidden in her foster parents' basement.<br/><br/>Although the book is narrated by death, many humorous moments keep the book from being too dark.<br/><br/>I recommend this for all teens and adults who enjoy history, books, and a good story on the ability of the human spirit to survive.
 The surprise of this book is the narrator! Death, out of boredom, or the need for some kind of escape instead of a holiday, finds "himself" fascinated by the lives of the living, especially those who for some reason escape him. He is particularly fascinated by life and emotions seen through the eyes of a little German girl during the Nazi period. Her story is told by Death through her eyes and with her surprising ways of describing events and feelings. Perhaps this is why such a narrator was so attracted to her story?<br/>A really moving and appealing book. A 'page turner'.<br/>I warmly recommend it.
 This is an achingly sad tale about love and hardship. It takes the history of war and makes us see it through the eyes of death, itself...and yet: the story is uplifting... an inspiration and an ode to the human spirit. It is, in fact, more about poetry and perspective, than just another story about people to survive in the midst of Hitler's war. Much of The Book Thief's power arises from the manner in which the story is told--the narrative style is a combination of art and magic. Beautifully, beautifully told.
 This is one of the finest books I have read in years.  The word pictures are dazzling and the characters so finely created.  I love them all.  Death as the narrator was amazing and it is easy to see why the choice was made.  It shows people as they are, multicolored, not just good and bad.  The whole book is my favorite part, every word used well and I so love Liesel, Rudy and the Mama and Papa.<br/>To see so much love in that strong woman and the devotion to Max.  This author reached down to his shoes for this one and I recommend it to anyone that likes a well written book.
 Rarely do such treasures come along that you delay finishing it...simply because you don't want it to end. 'The Book Thief' is told from the most clever perspective (I won't spoil for future readers). It will make you laugh, in spite of the historical content. You will root for all the beloved characters that Zusak has created. Don't be fooled...you will cry, too. All great works of literature have that potent ability. 'The Book Thief' is no exception, and it is now among my Top 10 of all time.
 Great, great book. I was hooked right from the start. At first the writing style was confusing, but not in a bad way. The narrator made me pay attention and search for meaning. I like that in a story. The story kept me emotionally connected, on a deep level. I reacted in so many ways, another sign of a good book.<br/><br/>If you've seen the movie - which I liked - you really need to read the book. There is so much more to the story, so much that was necessarily left out of a short movie. This book is one I'll definitely re-read and re-re-read.
 A teenage German girl learns about life from reading banded books. Death is the narrator. This story is well writen and the characters of the story are very well defined&gt;
 This book was phenomenal. I love the idea that it is narrated from the point of view of death. That is so hard to do and Markus Zusak still makes it interesting. The story is so fascinating, it really touches your heart. I loved the whole book from beginning to end. I would totally recommend this to everyone.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>So many thoughts sticked with me, such as the way Liesel got really attached to Max. The selfless man Hans was. How Rudy is always stealing food but he gave food to the Jews marching as he was starving.
 I bought this book because several people told me how wonderful it was. It is the very sad story of a young girl growing up in Hitler's Germany narrated by the Grim Reaper. He would tell you in advance some of the souls he'd be taking and I for one did not want to go there with him. There are some moments of fun, family, friends and good times. The story of the German people learning to live with more and more deprivation is well told.<br/>I only gave this book four stars because once I put it down I wasn't really sure that I wanted to pick it up and finish it.
 Zusak employs a unique, first person convention that I've never run across before; the Angel of Death as omnipotent narrator. It works beautifully and, to my surprise, the Angel of Death has a big heart.<br/><br/>There are so many great books that have come out about World War 2, particularly in the past 5 years or so. This one stands out. Do yourself a favor and you'll be very pleased with the time you spend.
 I'm a 62 year old man and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters were richly developed and memorable. The story was a heart wrenching vision of the horrors of life in Germany during WW2 as seen through the eyes and words of a 12 year old girl and narrated by the ever present character of death, the grim reaper. This book will make you think about what is really important in your own life.
 Excellent book.  The story is narrated by "death," which is a little odd at first, but it ultimately adds a small element of humor (for instance, death is amused by the sickel-carrying cloaked depictions of death we usually see in drawings or pictures), and death also gives glimpses of what happens later in the book; however, death itself is not the major storyline or character in the story.  The little girl is a compelling and layered character, sensitive, and her story is both heartbreaking and inspiring.  You feel deeply for her.  A really great book.
 I tried on more than one occasion to sit down to read this book, but after 10 or so pages, I tossed it aside in disgust because I just couldn't get into it.  What a mistake! I was getting ready to give it away and decided to try it one more time and am forever grateful.  This is one of the best books I've ever read.<br/><br/>From the clever way it was told, to the heartwarming characters, I finished this book in two days and really hated for it to end.  It made me laugh, cry and think, a tough thing to do for a picky reader like myself.<br/><br/>My book isn't going anywhere and will be put on my book shelf with with the rest of my favorite all time favorites.<br/><br/>Highly recommended and it really deserves 10 stars.
 absolutely a wonderful book!!  The story is about the strength of family in horrible conditions and in a time of unimaginable war.  The relationship of the young girl and her "step family" is very touching.  The descriptions and language used by the author are vivid and real.  While this book is intended for young adults, i found it engrossing for me as an adult.  The relationship the young girl has with her friend Rudy and the young Jewish man they hide from the Nazis is moving.  The power of written words is immense.  i recommend this book to everyone - young and old.  I am looking forward to the movie.
 I put off reading this book for years. I had heard of it but waited until the movie was released to read it. I wanted to see the movie, but had to read the book first. Now, I'm not sure I can see the movie. I'm afraid that the book will be ruined. The words. It's all about the words. Never have the words taken me on such a beautiful journey. I laughed, I cried, I prayed for Max, Liesel,  and Rudy. My heart was broken over and over as the words inched their way into my soul. I am a voracious reader and in my 55 years, have never felt words tromp on my heart and repair it in the same page. Thank you Mr. Zusak, for taking me on this journey.
 This book was highly recommended by a friend.  I liked it so much I watched the movie, my first ever, on Amazon Prime.  That really enhanced the book and brought faces and places together for me.  I would highly recommend both!!
 I loved this book and couldn't put it down.  The story of a young girl in Nazi Germany is told with amazing clarity of character.  Liesel, Rudy, Hans, Rosa and Max become people that you care about.  The fact that Death is telling the story is a unique and interesting twist that works well for this era.  I finished the book one day and saw the movie the next.  Of course, the book is so much better!<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to everyone from early teens to adults.  It would be good to have conversations with young people regarding what they would do in these circumstances.
 Sorry, but after reading this beautiful novel, I simply won't go see the movie.  The pictures Zusak paints with his words just could not be reproduced in a film.  This is a departure from my usual reading, but once I began reading, I could rarely put Kindle down.  The characters and incidents in the story that lingered in my mind long after the ending, as well as the fact that I spent several years of my youth living in Bavaria, allowed the story to be very real for me.  I appreciate the way the story told of good, normal people trying to live their good, normal lives in Nazi Germany.
 I have taught high school English for nearly 40 years. I picked up The Book Thief after reading Kirkus and Booklist reviews. What a wonderful book. The story is interesting and the writing is excellent. I've already recommended it to many of my students.<br/>You come upon a book like this every few years. The last time I was this impressed with a book was when I first stumbled upon Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes back in the 1990s. I highly recommend The Book Thief (for high school and up students and adults).
 A truly amazing book. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. This book will have you laughing one minute and crying the next. It's a beautifully written story of a young German girl at the beginning of World War II whose mother gives her up to foster parents. We read of the many trials and tribulations she endures and through her story, we see the incredible power of human emotions, compassion, altruism, and love in its many forms. The portrayal of the residents of a German town during the second world war shows us that German people were no different to others around the world and that although there were many who supported Hitler and his appalling reign, there were others who risked their lives to help Jewish people. The story is told from an unusual first person which, although I am not a believer in such things, I found very refreshing and it added to the underlying message of the story. The structure of the book is also unusual but again refreshing. The vocabulary used in the book makes it very easy to read but it is still powerfully emotive. The writing style makes this book suitable for readers from early teens upwards and the story is suitable for anyone. Just one word of warning - keep the tissues handy for the end of the book.
 When I first started reading The Book Thief, I wondered where it was going.<br/><br/>The narrator is very different.<br/><br/>Set in wartime Germany, it is about ordinary people and their lives, in particular, the girl Liesel and her adoptive family and their surroundings.<br/><br/>It highlights the good which lies in people, often well below the surface. It is my type of novel, not flashy but telling a human story without going over the top.<br/><br/>A most interesting tale, I will wait till I see how it was adopted for the cinema.
 From the moment I picked it up, I was enchanted. The point of view is especially interesting, as the speaker is actually Death. But Death is not malicious; Death is simply doing his job, and he does occasionally become attached to the humans that he watches. The storyline weaves around a young girl and her relationships with words, books and people. I have read many historical fiction books about WWII, and this is one of my favorites. The writing is poetic and sharp. There are definitely sad moments, but overall, the story is beautiful, and you will be grateful that you picked up this volume.
 Magnificent from beginning to end.  I could not put it down.  To see the effects of Nazi Germany through the eyes of a German child, as opposed to a Jewish child was genius.  I had never sympathized with the Germans, forgetting there were those who hid Jews, or wanted nothing to do with Hitler or his beliefs.<br/><br/>The novel is spins a beautiful tapestry of love with her adopted parents.  The gruff but caring mother and her father, a brave man who sees her through her fears of abandonment.  I felt her coming of age through Max, who's kindness and compassionate through the brutal surroundings shows the ability of humans to care with the juxtaposition of what is going on "outside the basement"<br/><br/>Run don't walk to read this book.
 This story will hang around long after the last page. First off is the point of view. Old Mr. Death himself spins the tale. Unusual sure, yet refreshing and bold. Second off is the author's use of words. Consider a couple of paraphrased examples. ' he stood up like a struck match.' Also, 'she wore a choking black dress.'  The incredible list of characters are described in a bare yet vivid manner. They simply light up the page. Lastly is the story itself. Two children, Liesel and Rudy, trying to survive war torn Germany. You'll laugh, cry and re-read passages. Definitely read this one.
 A student suggested this book to me. I was aware of it but hadn't decide to take it on. A few chapters in and I decided to teach it. This book needs to be thoroughly read. Then you must also teach about WWII and read Anne Frank and maybe watch the awful concentration camp videos... It is a story that hurts but also is so interesting.<br/> My best guess is Zuzak used Anne Drank's well-worn tale and flipped it. This device is genius. Fresh perspective on an awful story we MUST not forget. I am grateful to my student for suggesting this book. A lasting tale that has infected my dreams.
 Beautiful beautiful book. A must read, in my opinion. This book should be a must read in school, instead of some of the choices/crap that they stuff down these kids throats today. My mature 11 year old read this on her own choosing, I wasn't sure if it was a good idea as I had not read it, but knew of the subject matter. Turns out that she was very moved by it. Now a favorite of both of ours as I read it shortly after.
 I really loved The Book Thief especially because the narration was so different. Death as a narrator gives the books a different dimension. Death adds his own commentary and it gives you the feeling that the story in unfolding before you. You know everything that is going on in Liesel's head but also everyone else's in the story. Death also tells you what will happen in the future even if I didn't like what was going to happen but it did help me prepare myself for it. I like how bits and pieces gave you an idea what was happening with the war outside of Molching so I had an idea where Hitler was without just knowing they years. I also liked this story because it is from a different perspective of the Holocaust. It tells the story of a young girl who grew up in the middle of Hitler's regime and how not everyone sided with Hitler and what it could have been like for any normal person back then. It showed that the war affected everyone: their food was rationed, the poor were left with even less money, and anyone that didn't conform to the party was ostracized and shunned. Sometimes I felt the story was true because the characters felt so real sometimes. Many of the characters were fleshed out really well and you felt like they were real people. There was never a minor character. Each and everyone seemed to have a hidden pain or a secret that you would have never guessed and they all made the story feel more real. My one problem was I did like how Death would give you snapshots of the future sometimes I wish they weren't mentioned so I wouldn't have them hanging over my head for the bulk of the book but I do believe it did make the actions of the characters even more meaningful because you know what they would culminate to. It made me relish some of the moments between the characters because I knew one would not make it.
 It took me a few weeks to get through "The Book Thief".  Although the chapters are brief, the story was easy to follow.  The narrator was unique in ways that I had never experienced in all the reading I've done.  Telling the story of Liesel Meminger, Hans and Rosa Huberman, Max Vandenburg, and Rudy Steiner through the eyes of Death was truly amazing.<br/><br/>I have not seen the movie that was made from this book and I don't know that I want to.  It just feels as if there is no way that Hollywood could do justice to an incredible story such as this.
 My freshman high school student was assigned this book as an annotation project, which is why I purchased a used book rather than a newly printed one.  The character of Death narrates the story.  My student would not have read the book for pleasure, but found it educational and emotional.
 This is one of the best stories I have read in a long time, and I read a lot of good books. The author did a great job building characters and settings, without spiraling into tangents. As a reader, I was able to feel connected...going through a roller coaster of emotions as the main character lived life and in spite of the odds, found love and friendship. She even found bits of pleasure during times of depression and war. Although this is a story written from the perspective of death, it is really a story about choosing to live life.
 Although I understand that this book was written for teenage readers, it was selected by one of the older members (88) of my book club to read for the month of June 2014.  The story was laden with history and while very sad, it was an extremely enjoyable read with bits of humor to temper the sadness.  I enjoyed the bits of German language as well as the fact that it was clearly shown that there were many German people who did not believe, as Hitler did, that the Jewish race is inferior.  I can't wait to hear what our Jewish book club member has to say about the book, but I have talked to her briefly and know that she liked it very much too.
 Rarely a novel comes along that tells a story that whilst bleak and tragic, takes the reader on a trip which encapsulates beauty, resourcefulness, raw humanity and finding a place to exist in a world that is fast falling apart. Never before has death been handled in such a gentle way that beauty and tragedy forge a relationship to deliver the reader vivid imagery and perfect narrative.<br/><br/>Essentially The Book Thief does not follow standard narrative timing, the narrator will give a glimpse of the future to present a context to the past. This style is key to creating multi layers of detail which soften the harrowing blows as they eventually fall thick and fast. Unusually and effectively this sees the story move towards the ending we were presented at the very beginning of the novel. However don't think it is all bleak, the relationships forged in heartbreak, friendships cemented through shared adventure and the simple bonds of good people doing what they believe is right in the face of adversity creates enough warmth to sustain the reader.  Where Zusak presents grim imagery he will often oppose this with breathtaking moments of simple humanity, encapsulating a palate of colour that spreads itself thickly over a decidedly grey time of recent history.<br/><br/>In essence whilst others will tell you The Book Thief is about death or war or a love of words, the most important theme of the book is humanity. Stepping forward when others do not, accepting your fate and dealing with it the best way you know how, finding beauty in simplicity, seeking out colour when nothing remains.
 The Book Thief's story is probably one of the best books I have ever read, and I am a true bibliophile!  Death makes the characters live, and they live in color, in senses,  tragedy, in laughter, and in heartbroken cries. Using Death as the narrator, personification was a tool wielded beautifully by the author. The book is so crammed with unexpected metaphor that it seems at times to be poetry rather than prose.  It humanizes the poor in Germany that are rarely spoken of, while acknowledging the horrific, unimaginable events of that time. This is one of those books that leads me to think I might be disappointed in the movie because it could not compare in richness.
 I saw the movie first, then decided I had to read the book. The movie stuck pretty close to the book. One interesting feature of both is that the narrator is Death.<br/><br/>I was surprised to learn this book was written for the young adult. It is a coming of age story, but it is also a satisfying read for mature adults.<br/><br/>We are taken inside Germany during WW II and given an empathetic look at ordinary Germans at this time, some of whom did their best to not take part in the anti-Semetic horrors of the Nazi Party.<br/><br/>It's an easy read, and I recommend it.
 It's a slow moving book, but I am still feeling the effects of Leisel's life in Hitler's Germany.  The story is a reverse of Anne Frank.  Instead of being a hidden Jew, it tells the beautiful story a young German girl who is in the home where a Jewish Man is being hidden.  The love of Foster parents, help this young girl know what keeping a promise can mean.  I loved the book so much that I went and bought the DVD the same day.  I think everyone should read the book before watching the move.  It will haunt you
 Just finished reading *The Book Thief*. I'm sitting here, feeling simultaneously shattered and uplifted. This may be the most perfectly written novel I have ever read. The language - every word - is absolutely right - beautiful and poetic and rich. The characters are genuine, flawed, and glorious. The plot never bogs down - it carried me through on a strong current from beginning to end. This book really touched me.<br/>Karen Molenaar Terrell
 The Book Thief was bought for my 15 year old daughter to read.  The book was hard to keep interested in due to it being complicated to understand some of what the author was trying to convey.  It was a very sad book and just not what I was looking for in a good read at this time. In my opinion, I would not buy this book again.<br/><br/>It was an overall good value for the book and I bought it in the paper back edition.
 This book was recommended to me by my sister in-law and I have to say I loved it.  Mr Zusak most certainly has a way with words.  He gives great thought to how he describes even the most simplest of things.  What other writers would overlook as perhaps insignificant 'fillers' to a story, he somehow brings to life and you can see what he sees.  I've never come across an author with the power to ignite words the way he seems to do so effortlessly.<br/>Nazi Germany is never an easy topic to tackle, especially from a German perspective but I thought Mr Zusak did tremendously well. The scenes of the Jews walking down Munich Street were very difficult to read, but Mr Zusak captured it perfectly, that you felt like you were there watching it all unfold.  Even when Death supposedly ruined the ending by speaking of it several chapters before, I was still left surprised and a little shell shocked when it did happen.<br/>Great story by a great author.  Well Done Sir.
 Thoroughly absorbing. I've always been curious how the German people felt about Hitler and the holocaust. This book was very enlightening, warm, touching. Everyday life, Jewiish sympathizers, rationing, staunch Nazis, all come together in a neighborhood on the road to Dachau. The writing reminded me of a painting.
 This book is a very thought provoking way to look at a situation that has been written about and filmed numerous times.  We all know the events of World War II Germany, but we don't often have a chance to see the daily lives of the non Jewish German's who did not agree with the Furor's beliefs. Having Death as the narrator was confusing at first, but so very clever, providing a completely unique outlook on the events.  I also liked the way the author wrapped up each character and never left us guessing what happened to them.  Now I think I will watch the movie and I hope it is as well done as the book.
 This book has touched my heart in many ways I thought this book was going to be the most boring book I ever read but it was quite the opposite it made me feel informed about emotions and it was overall the best book I ever read and plan to read it again in my lifetime and recommend it to everyone.
 I found the cast of characters well developed in the story; like and at same time disliked the writing. At times Zusak's writing reminded me of poetry rather than prose; there could be sadness, bitterness and a glimmer of hope within one small paragraph.  A tale narrated by Death is an unusual and interesting concert.<br/><br/>The story of shattered lives, pain &amp; horror by the Nazis in WWII; loss of lives.  It was a long read but the writer did bring you back just when you thought "enough is enough".  The ending was expected but  was extremely painful.
 I have rarely read such an emotive description of life. In the first 10 pages alone, I had already underlined five paragraphs whose eloquence I did not want to forget. The choice of narrator was brilliant and added a philosophical dimension to the story-insights which one rarely considers in the drama of life, especially as written in a story. The characters were developed well, using descriptive vignettes which gave us insights without having to overload the reader(and the story) with long-winded descriptions. The use of drawings to "illustrate" the experiences of some of the characters was marvelously creative. I don't know how it will translate to the screen but this is one of my all-time top ten favorite books.
 I have read so many books and watched so many movies about the War it's horrors and depravity and understand even better now having read these "words" and heard  the Book Thief's "voice" how very important that the story be written down and told again and again from every perspective so that the how of the horror is never allowed to be forgotten and God willing never repeated.<br/><br/>And it is a beautiful story with characters that will stay with me for a long time and will inspire me to be hopeful for most humans for long while as well.<br/><br/>Thank you Markus Zusak!
 This book was a big departure from the normal books I like to read. For one, it's SAD. Two, its a slow read. Normally I enjoy fast easy reads that make me feel good, an easy escape so to speak. But I really wanted to read it before the movie comes out.<br/><br/>With that said, I REALLY loved this book. I think it was written beautifully and I loved the style of writing. Smart, clever ways of weaving informations into the story. I should have known it would be sad since the story is told from DEATH's perspective, but it was such a lovely story that I didn't feel terrible after it ended.<br/><br/>You can read the description for the plot, just know that its a wonderful story, well written, a slow read but totally worth it!
 somebody said this book deserved more than 5 stars and i completely agreed. It's a brilliant story about a girl adopted by 'normal' German family during WWII, her adventures with school-mate Rudy, admiration for books, and fondness for music played by the loving papa.<br/>It's also a tragic story about fanatical Germans, atrocities of the war and the brutality of the regime leading to the death of millions of people around the world.<br/>But the books is not about politics. It's about normal but poor live in Germany, and about the power of words. I loved the book and was impressed by the narrator reading that book on CDs. Highly recommended for adults and children.
 Excellent book/movie about living in fear in Hitler's Germany. Very moving/sad but it is Nazism and there are bound to be deaths. As long as you go into it knowing a favorite character can die you will be prepared. Loved the character of Lesile Memminger. All children should have to read. There are people who want to try and brush away the extermination/ torture of millions of human beings by a maniac and his followers. If we don't teach about what happened in the past how do we hope to keep it from happening again. Although as far as I am concerned it is happening in the Middle East now.
 OMG<br/>I read this book in a day<br/>The narrator of this novel left me wondering who they were till the end.  I had my ideas, but I wasn't exactly sure until the end of the book.<br/>Zusak is quite descriptive with his characters, enough that I was able to imagine them and immerse myself into the book.<br/>Have kleenex handy while reading this book...if you don't need them then you are a soulless individual!<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this book to anyone to read...yes even teenagers...the book has many morals and values to learn.
 "The Book Thief " is one of the best novels I have read. Truly! Author Markus Zusak's storyline is both sad and wonderful, as it deals with Germany during WWII and the Holocaust. His memorable characters have tremendous depth, and the plot is extremely original. However, what makes this book so extraordinary is the author's writing, which, at times, is more poetry than prose. I frequently found myself reading passages of the elegantly written narrative aloud.<br/><br/>Appropriately for the times, Death is our narrator and a major character. Death, the "gatherer of souls," writes of himself, "I do not carry a sickle or scythe. I only wear a hooded black robe when it's cold. And I don't have those skull-like facial features you seem to enjoy pinning on me from a distance. You want to know what I really look like? I'll help you out. Find yourself a mirror while I continue." In the Prologue, Death states, "Here is a small fact: you are going to die. Does that worry you? I urge you - don't be afraid. I'm nothing if not fair." The figure describes himself as amiable, even affable, but warns, "don't ask me to be nice. 'Nice' has nothing to do with me.'"<br/><br/>When the novel begins, Death is gearing up for mass production. It is 1939 and WWII has just begun. By 1945 the entire world will be at war. And it is Death who comments on man's inhumanity to mad, almost without emotion, in as objective a manner as possible. This inhumanity will cause it/him to work 24/7 in various places in the world at once. That's what I call multi-tasking.<br/><br/>Nine year-old Liesel Meminger is our protagonist, "the book thief," although when we meet her, she is unschooled and cannot read very well. Liesel, her little brother Werner, and their mother are on a train to Munich. All three are skinny and pale, with sores on their lips. It is on the train that Death comes to claim young Werner's soul. Liesel and her mother despair. The boy is buried near the city, and one of the gravediggers, an apprentice, drops a black book as he walks away in the freezing winter weather. Liesel picks up the book, without calling out to notify the gravedigger of his loss. The book is titled, in silver letters, "The Gravedigger's Handbook." It is the first book she steals. So much has been taken from her, the grieving child feels like she settles part of the score when she commits the theft. In Munich the girl's mother bids her good-bye and turns her over to a foster care woman. The mother disappears, never to be seen again.<br/><br/>Liesel and the woman make their way to a small town, Molching, on the outskirts of Munich, close to the Dachau death camp. They stop at a small house on Himmel Street, where her new foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, await the little girl. Hans is a kind and loving man who quickly takes to Liesel and visa versa. Rosa is also basically kind, although she puts up a front as a shrewish loudmouth. She is a laundress by trade and Hans is a house painter who loves to play the accordion. He is not a member of the Nazi Party. When he realizes he is losing customers because of his lack of enthusiasm for Hitler and the Nazis, he tries to join but his papers are on permanent hold. Their two children are grown and live away from home.<br/><br/>Liesel has terrible nightmares and occasionally wets the bed. Hans, hearing her late night screams, sits with her and comforts her, sometimes until dawn. Occasionally he plays the accordion for her until Rosa yells at him to "shut up!" The empathetic, kindly man and the traumatized little girl form a close bond and Hans begins to teach Liesel to read, especially as she is fascinated by words. She believes that words have great power, after all, Hitler didn't need guns to persuade the German people to follow him and to hate Jews. He used words.<br/><br/>When she begins school and the teacher realizes that the girl can't read, she is placed in a class with younger children. Most humiliating! It is during one of Liesel's frequent nightmares, that Hans begins to teach her to read. Since the Hubers have no books of their own, Hans uses Liesel's "The Gravedigger's Handbook." as a teaching tool. Then another book, a copy of "Mein Kampf," is acquired, one of the few available books which have not been burned. And yet another book, "The Shoulder Shrug." which Liesel snatches from a pile of burning books, is added to her collection. "Germans loved to burn things. Shops, synagogues, Reichstags, houses, personal items, books and of course, people."<br/>Eventually, Liesel acclimates to her new home and makes friends, especially with Rudy, the boy next door and her biggest fan. She never overcomes her nightmares, however, nor does she ever forget her mother and brother. It is at this time when she is forced to join Hitler Youth.<br/><br/>Then Max Vandenberg, a German Jew in hiding, comes to ask Hans to fulfill a promise he made to his father, a comrade in arms who saved Hans' life during WWI. A Jew seeking refuge...what to do? Hans, an honorable man, feels obligated to keep his promise, even though it would mean death for Rosa and himself if Max were discovered in their home. Liesel is sworn to secrecy. The Hubers take the man in and set up living quarters for him in the basement. Max becomes part of the family and forms a close friendship with Liesel. She becomes his eyes and ears to the outside world. He eventually writes a book for her, "The Standover Man" - a simple, illustrated and haunting book about what it is like to be born Jewish in Hitler's Germany.<br/><br/>Life goes on. Liesel learns to read and steals more books - fourteen in all. She and her friends adventure. Germany declares war on Russia. Death's work increases, especially on the eastern front and in the concentration camps. He/it feels overwhelmed by the souls to collect from the camps, gas chambers, battlefields, and causalities from air-raid bombings. Max begins to do crossword puzzles in the old newspapers Liesel occasionally finds for him. Rosa's and Han's workload diminishes significantly. Times are tough, rationing is strict, and<br/>people don't have money to send out their laundry or to have their houses painted. And, of course, Hans carries the stigma of not belonging to the Party. I don't want to include any spoilers, so I will stop my summary here.<br/><br/>This is a powerful novel that kept me riveted throughout. As I wrote above, I sometimes stopped to read parts of the prose aloud. There is humor here also. One needs comic relief when reading a novel about such a heinous period in mankind's history.<br/><br/>Markus Zusak's  parents grew up in Nazi Germany and Austria. He frequently thought of writing about the things his parents had seen during the war. He says he thought about the "importance of words in that time, and what they were able to make people believe and do."<br/><br/>The novel's last words belong to Death: "A LAST NOTE FROM YOUR NARRATOR: I am haunted by humans."<br/>JANA
 Since I believe I could actually be a thief of books if left lying around on the ground unattended, I enjoyed reading about a little girl who was quite sweetly like-minded.  I've read other Nazi Germany novels (e.g. Night) that did not allow me to finish them because it tore at my heart too much, but this novel had a soft approach (but was thorough in content).  This was a great read and I am actually considering reading Zusak's next novel, The Messengers.
 The Book Thief is a simply written (translated) yet poignant "story/poem". The narrator's use of colors to describe emotions was very different and meaningful.  Each character was fleshed out fully not so much by description but rather by that character's actions, words and thoughts.  Having read much fiction depicting the Nazi era, I found that I could just as fully feel the horror of the time and empathize with the average German citizen as with the victims of the rampage.  After reading the book, I thought that I would love the movie but it fell so far short of the emotional impact that I was more impressed with the power of words to evoke emotions than ever.  The film could not show the colors and humanity of the characters as well as the author's writing. I loved the book and find it unforgettable.
 My granddaughter had to read this book this summer for school.  She recommended it to me and I loved it.  I have also seen the movie but the book was much better.  The hardships endured during wars are unspeakable.
 I was hesitant about the subject matter of another Hitler/Holocaust/World War ll backdrop, however the characters of the tale immediately capture you heart and imagination and the perspective of the story being narrated by Death himself is a somewhat new concept. I enjoyed the underlying tales like friendship, compassion, the bonds of love, and the condition of the human heart to stand in the face of adversity. This is not a book to highlight or romance the holocaust in any way but more so about how it affected the characters in this little German Town and how deep inside they stood for something more than what was outwardly displayed.
 this book brought me back to stories told to me by a great Aunt,who left Poland after her father was killed by Natzi's for being the mayor of his town. I saw a young man reading it for a high school class,and decided to read it myself,such an insightful look into  Natzi Germany thru the eyes of a child
 This is one of those books that you pick up and you are continuously surprised. The author crafts a great story and uses different aspects and different vantage points to take the reader through the war. The personification and characterization of death was very effective and added so much to the story. I felt as though I knew these characters and we were friends and I was right there along for the ride with them. Really good book in so many ways- characters, plot/story, writing style, this book might not be the best book I have read, but it is the best book I have read in the last year or so.
 The Book Thief is a finely tuned tale of of a young girl in WWII-era Germany. The book is narrated by Death, who was very busy during the pre-war years, which only gets worse as Germany moves toward war and struggles through the war years. It provides an interesting view of the "poor" street of a small town - the unique characters and their struggles to survive with neighbors who both support and  reject Hitler. The characters are vivd and well developed - including Death - and the story moves forward at a nice pace. One of the bet books I've read lately.
 The book was hard for me to follow at the beginning until I understood who was telling the story. It was interesting t o see the other side of the war  story. A of the characters seemed like real people.
 "The Book Thief" caught me in its literary and humanitarian spell. Death narrates and reveals himself not as the Grim Reaper but as an observer of human frailty. This novel, which takes place during the rise and reign of Hitler, brings readers inside a German village and into the hearts and minds of people subject to the cruel facts of life under a dictator. It is an in-depth overview of all the people, Germans and Jews alike, during Hitler's horrific rule. Liesel, the book thief, keeps herself, Max (a Jew her family is hiding), and people in the town hopeful and alive through books she steals and reads to them. For me, this unique use of the power of the written word is one of the more touching and original themes I have read in the many novels I read. I did not want to put this book down. It is a page turner that reaches deep into the heart and mind. I sent copies to friends and family, for it is one of those books that becomes a friend for life and changes one's outlook on death, life and human folly. ...]
 The book was an easy read (it's for young adults).  It also provided a different perspective in story telling.  Death provides an objective and impassionate point of view as the narrator.<br/><br/>The main character Lisel is real with real human flaws - I'm sure that's what makes her so likeable.  Yet she also is an extraordinary young girl who exhibits great courage under extremely dangerous circumstances.<br/><br/>The book is for young adult readers but old and young alike will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>This book can give young girls a much better role model than many of the young adult books on the market today.<br/>The Book Thief is a great read - you won't be disappointed.
 Hmmm...The Book Thief already has 522 5 star reviews, what more is there to add?  I'm not sure I can add much, but let me say that if there were 10 stars available that's what I would give it!<br/><br/>What makes The Book Thief different, in my mind, are two things.  First, the narration by Death is truly a wonderful twist and unique perspective.  Second is the interesting perspective of Leisel, the German girl growing up during WWII and the Holocaust.  This isn't the Diary of Anne Frank because she herself is not Jewish nor is she in hiding or at risk for being killed by her own countrymen for who she is (though she is if it is found out she is hiding a Jew).  However, this is different than a story told by 'just' a girl living through it, as it has directly affected her since her parents were 'taken away' because her father was a Communist.  She has also experienced the death of her young brother. These two factors give the book a fascinating and unique perspective which is utilized to its fullest by the author's masterful writing.<br/><br/>In an interview I read the author said, when asked about his writing style, that he thought it would be wonderful if there were a little twist, a little play of words, a unique descriptive phrase for the reader on each page.  He has clearly accomplished that.<br/><br/>Though I haven't read Kurt Vonnegut Jr for many years, I detect a hint of his style here...<br/><br/>In short, one of the best books I have ever read...a definite 5 stars and highly recommended.  In fact, I thought it was an important enough book that I bought a hardcover copy to have in the house even though I originally purchased and read it on my Kindle!
 I am interested in this period of time (Nazi Germany) and the life of the "ordinary" people of the small towns and villages. The story with very well narrated, lots of details to make you feel you were really there. The main character was charming and curious and brave. And this was based on a true story which makes it even more interesting. If you have seen the movie, the book was way better because of all the details which the movie, by shortage of time, had to leave out, making the story less than it was, which was an incredible portrait of the human soul and the will to survive.
 I was skeptical at the first chapter of this book. I thought it would be an odd stream of consciousness work but I was wrong. What follows that first chapter is the engrossing tale of a young girl trapped in a world at war. It showcases true love and sacrifice. The book will challenge you to consider your own moral limitations and champion the human spirit. The narrative is lengthy and if you are looking for a feel good novel, keep searching. However, for a book that is true to its time period and resonates with you after you have read it, this book is deserving of your time.
 The Book Thief is well written but it's not something I enjoyed reading.  The problem with the book is that it is too dark and depressing--550 pages of sadness and suffering.  One might expect that when the subject is NAZI Germany, but this is one of the worst I've ever read in that regard.  It does take the reader inside the horrors of  living under Hitler's grip on the country and the characters are realistic in a way the reader feels their pain--but too much pain, too much sadness, too much sorrow.  It left me feeling drained.
 I teach middle school language arts and design an entire unit related to the Holocaust. This is one of the most insightful books I have ever read about World War II, and I think it is the only book I have read that relates the events of the war through the eyes of an impoverished, decent German family that is simply trying to survive without being swept away by Nazi propaganda. This book beautifully depicts the power of words to kill and to give life, and illustrates how love can cross any barrier that humans build.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book!
 When I started this book I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. Multiple people suggested it to me to read but usually I read complete fiction. Nevertheless I decided to try this book. I'm so glad I did. This book deserves way more than 5 stars. Markus Zusak did an amazing job. This is by far my favorite book. It's changed my life and overlook on things. I just finished it and I can't stop crying, even as I write this. Sure, in the middle I was a little bored with it but I think that's one thing that tied this book together. If a book didn't have some boring parts and just all action and excitement it would be a terrible book.<br/><br/>I would suggest for anyone above 13 to read this unless you have a high understanding of real events in history. The Book thief will open your eyes to events that really happened. More than once, I would be in bed reading and have to make myself put the book down for the night because I was shaking so bad and because it was so late. If your below the age of 13, you won't understand this book as well. But defiantly everyone should eventually read this.<br/><br/>Overall this really is an amazing book that deserves more than 5 stars. I've said that already but it needs to be said more than once. Usually I don't write reviews but I felt like this book deserved it.
 I really enjoyed this book. The writing style is unique and might give some readers a little trouble. I would recommend this book for anyone ages 10 and above. This book is about a young German girl living with her foster parents during World War II in Germany. The author does reference the war on Jews, Hitler, concentration camps, etc. Not all the references are fully explained, so I would recommend for a child and a parent to read this book together so the child can fully understand what the book is talking about.
 I remember when I first heard about the Holocaust.  I was in high school in 1970.  I went home and asked my mom about it (she was in high school during wwll)  I couldn't believe the world would let something like that happen.  From then on,I was intrigued by the subject.  I have collected many books about the subject focusing on novels about Jewish children and their plight.  This book focused on the German children and their lives during the war.  A very moving story and very interesting.  The story is told by Death and is based on the life of a young girl in Germany during WWll.
 Well, I saw the movie "Death Takes a Holiday" made many years ago;  I watched "Meet Joe Black" and really liked it.  This book from the perspective of "death" is so tender and sad yet really quite beautiful.  It was difficult reading the ending in the waiting room of the dental office where I was waiting for my sister and had tears profusely rolling down my cheeks.  A very sweet and endearing story.  I commend the imagination to present this old theme of Nazi Germany in such a fresh narrative.
 It just gets better and better as the story progresses.  At first, I had a hard time following and working to figure out 'who is telling this story'?  Once I had that 'aha' moment, it all made much more sense.  I had to read it to figure out what all the hype was and I wanted to read it before the movie came out.  I don't know if all the hype was worth it, but it was a good story. Your heart will become closely attached to the characters and the book created in the basement (within the story) was beautiful and truly made perfect sense.  It all started with words!!
 I got this for my summer reading assignment, and it really is a wonderful and inspirational book. I'm not gonna go into detail; don't wanna spoil anything.<br/>It came in the mail 2 days after I ordered with the standard shipping, so that's a plus. It just came in a manila colored bag with a little bubble wrap on the inside. I was expecting a box with some air-filled bags like the last time I ordered a book, but I guess you don't need that much to protect a 500 page book, do you.<br/>The binding wasn't ripped, and the covered weren't folded. No damage during the shipping process.<br/>I'm very satisfied and I would totally recommend this book to anyone. It's truly a great, great book.
 great read. highly recommend. very different from any other WWII type book I have read. made you think during the read and after it was over.  so glad I read it (woman 29 yrs old) my whole book club liked it and we don't agree on many that unanimously!
 The Book Thief is told by an unusual narrator...The Grim Reaper.  There are no surprise endings to this story for it is an accounting of the many souls which the very busy Reaper  claims during Hitler's destruction of Europe.<br/>  The Book Thief is a young girl who has witnessed much death and abandonment in her young life.  In this story we see the harshness of the war through the eyes of  two young neighborhood friends as they are growing up.  We see what life was like for all who did not agree with Hitler's beliefs.<br/>  We all know the story, but this book has a unique perspective which makes it fresh and emotionally compelling.
 Obsessed with this edition! I love it! Came in perfect condition and wrapped in plastic, too! Thank you so much :) I already own a copy but I this collector’s edition was a must! Multiple copies are encouraged ;)
 I dont very often write book reviews but I'll make an exception here.  The book thief is about a little girl growing up in German before during and after WWII . It's told by  DEATH!  If you love historical fiction or just love a great read this is the book to get.  You will cry, smile &amp; fall in love with the book thief as she tries to live a very poor life in Nazi Germany. This is definitely a book that I will add to my vast collection of classics and I will read and re-read it over and over and still enjoy in the years to come!
 I cant even put into words how much i loved this book. I've read a lot of WWII novels yet ive never felt more compelled to write a review on a ANYTHING until now. I even purchased the hard cover just to have it on my shelf. Such a beatiful story about a horrible time... I fell in love with each and every character, even death himself. "i am haunted by humans"... chills
 I really enjoyed this book.  It was beautifully written.  The characterization was expertly done.  Even a less important character such as Frau Holtzapfel's character development was sympathetically and humanely done.<br/><br/>There are many instances where Zusak gives lifeless objects human qualities, eg "Hans Hubermann had her by one hand.  Her small suitcase had her by the other" (p 36), and "A bathrobe answered the door" (p 49).  I made countless notes on my Kindle of beautifully written passages, which I have never done with other books.<br/><br/>The Book Thief started slowly, though.  If it wasn't for the fact that other reviewers gave it such good reviews, I may not have finished it.  But I am glad I did.  This book will stay with me for a long time.
 I saw the movieThe Book Thief first. When I found that the store was based on a book. I she ached for the book on Amazon. It was much better than the movie version. Alto more details were disclosed. I recommend the book to anyone who wishes to read a page turner. At first on the movie I thought the narrator was God but the book clearly tells you who he is right from the start. Great read I have recommended it to many of my friends.
 I thought it was going to be very strange when I started to read it, it almost did not seem like a book about WWII at all and the narrator (guide) of the book seemed so bizarre..but I kept reading. I was amazingly surprised how everything tied in and flowed. The author's striking observances and exceptional way with words just floored me. I could picture everything from the visual to the emotions. I have read many books about WWII and also from the experience of what German citizen's went through and this is one of the best. I highly recommend it. I didn't want to put it down. I have not seen the movie yet.
 Markus Zusak's most popular novel was written with the most beautiful language I have ever seen in a children's book. As it is set in World War II-era Germany, I had originally expected the story to be a mere repetition of the countless other young adult novels I'd read with the same setting, and, quite frankly, the story was a little dull. The characters were well-developed, but not the most interesting. Also, the events and setting had mostly been done before in other books. However, what makes The Book Thief stand out is the writing style. Every page is filled with vibrant imagery, making a relatively normal story seem exotic and full of passion. Additionally, Death is by far the most engaging and original narrator I have ever experienced. The very first few pages of the novel all but took my breath away.<br/>This is not an action-packed, plot-driven book, and for that reason, it won't be loved by everyone. However, I highly recommend it to anyone with the same passion for the English language as me, and anyone who adores fresh, thought-provoking, original story full of passion and heartbreak.
 It wasn't until I finished the book that I realized it was intended for young adults.  The picture the story paints tells of the struggles the German people faced during Hitler's Third Reich.  The ordinary citizen felt the same fear as all people felt at the time.  And the poverty imposed on the country so that Hitler could support his war machine, his annihilation of the Jews and to enrich the already fat pockets of his friends and colleagues is starkly revealed in its pages.  For all those who believe that the German people did not suffer under this oppressive regime, this book should be an eye-opener.<br/><br/>I would also recommend the enhanced version of the book.  The scenes from the film are beautiful and poignant. I Turkey hope the film garners the Academy Awards it deserves.
 I have never before felt compelled to write a book review, though I've read many wonderful books.  And I have to confess that I didn't read the book, but listened to the audio version because I have a long commute to work.  It's rare that a book makes me forget I'm sitting in Boston traffic (if you live in Boston, you know what I mean).  It's even more rare when a book makes me talk back.  In listening to "The Book Thief," I found myself saying, "well done," as if I were talking to the author.<br/><br/>As a writer, I know how difficult it is to paint with words, yet the authors does so - and beautifully.  Liesel is a unique heroine that shows us the horror of Nazi Germany through a child's eyes.  A child who does not dwell in self pity, but finds a way to survive through books.  I used books in a similar way when I was a child, so felt much compassion for her.  But I also felt compassion for Rosa and "Death."<br/><br/>My sincere admiration to this extremely talented writer.  I know mine is only one of more than one thousand excellent reviews, but I hope it reaches you (I have only a few dozen reviews for my own book, but every one means so much) -- or helps to convince someone else to buy this remarkable book.
 Once I began this story, I could not put it down.  The author puts you directly into the Holocaust, with all of its increasing horrors, and lets you see, on a day to day basis, the existence the folks of this town endured. My history books from school described it, but not to this level.  It's very easy to become connected to the characters and all they go through. You truly get to know these characters -- their strengths, weaknesses, fears, triumphs, humor, heart, and so on.  A wonderful tribute to the enduring human spirit.
 The Book Thief is one of the best books ever. The anniversary issue has wonderful illustrations that add to the richness of the story. Zusak writes beautifully about the life of a young girl caught in the hardships and moral dilemmas of World War II Germany. This book has a permanent place in my personal library and I will read it over and over again.
 As an English teacher, I have read many, many great books.  In my opinion, The Book Thief is at the very top of this list.<br/><br/>If you haven't read it, you must. It will be a big gift you give yourself, and you will see life through new eyes...you might have a new perspective on Death, too, who, by the way tells the story of Liesel, the book thief.  He tells us in the beginning when he introduces himself as the narrator that this is a "small story."  When you read the back jacket, that's how it definitely appears.  But sometimes, we find extraordinary treasure in the smallest of things...<br/><br/>The Book Thief is the story of a little girl growing up in Nazi Germany.  One day, in great sorrow and shock over the loss of her brother, she picks up a book, thus beginning her "life of word thievery."  Her foster father, Hans, teaches her to read, and slowly, very slowly, she begins to see truth in her small world--a truth that is at the same time horrific and ugly and remarkably beautiful.  When Hans and his rough around the edges wife Ruby take in a Jewish fighter by the name of Max, Liesel finds something else--not just a friend, but a sort of soul mate who shares her love of words and a hunger for understanding and acceptance.<br/><br/>Liesel is no stranger to poverty, loneliness, rejection and loss--Liesel and Death are well acquainted.  But while Liesel may intrigue Death, she is, without a doubt, the true picture of a relentless and fragile survivor.  Just as Liesel is well acquainted with greatest heartbreak, she is also no stranger to love:  her accordion playing foster father, Hans, who shows Liesel unconditional love for the first time, was a character I adored from his very first introduction.  Liesel's best friend Rudy, who breaks my heart in a thousand ways, shows her a friendship that transcends circumstance and danger.  Her foul-mouthed by fiercely loyal and determined Aunt Ruby is more than meets the eye--in a good way--and the mayor's wife?  Well, she is a character so intriguing, so delicate, and so pure that despite her "small" role, she is captivating.  Other than Liesel, though, my favorite character was Max.  In a word, Max is a paradox of warrior tenacity and will and delicate sensitivity and kindness.<br/><br/>The Book Thief offers more than a remarkable story:  it is a celebration of words, themselves:  the most beautiful words that will break your heart in a deliciously devastating way. In the words of Liesel:  "I love this place and hate it, because it is full of words."  I love words, too...so much it hurts sometimes!!  The way Zusak plays with and manipulates his words into portraits of heartbreak, love, and raw beauty rains on the soul.  If there was ever a book that shows you the power of the written word to change minds, hearts and perspectives, this one is it.  It will stay with me forever.<br/><br/>The narrator, Death, states that he is "haunted by humans."  I know that feeling.  I will be haunted by The Book Thief forever.
 This book is slow as it develops it's characters, who in the majority are children.  And there were points at which I was close to losing interest, but then it happened and the story took wings.  The author's style of writing and word smithing was splendid, at some of the most powerful moments he used wrong words which had irrelevant literal meanings, but so perfectly was a flat note or a "Klunk" but that moment had so much momentum that the Klunk just made you<br/>Fill in that blank with your own search for meaniing, which caused the reader to more deeply experience that moment.  I was blown away with the way this author navigated so many powerful moments in this story.  Markus took the time and invested a load of intellectual and author's psychological energy to create what I trust is a future classic.  I wish everything I read were half as good
 This book was assigned to my 14 year old son as part of his honors 8th grade language arts class and since I was not familiar with it, decided I would read it also.  What a joy pleasant surprise!  Set in Nazi Germany, World War II is viewed from the perspective of the German people, many of whom were less than thrilled with the Nazi regime.  A perspective we don't often hear about.  A great read for all ages.  I plan to encourage my two college age daughters to read "The Book Thief" this summer.
 Although the delivery is a bit peculiar, with Death serving as narrator, the story of The Book Thief is captivating.  The characters and  setting are fully and engagingly drawn.  It covers a sometimes overlooked side of World War II, namely, the suffering of regular German folks who did not support Hitler.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that I had to buy the Enhanced Movie Tie-In Edition.  The Enhancements did not work on my Kindle.  Also, when I first tried to buy the book from Amazon last fall, it was not available for purchase because the Movie Tie-In Edition was not ready.
 There is little that I can say about this book that has not already been written by other reviewers. It is a very moving story about an adolescent girl having to face the reality of living in Nazi Germany as well as the moral responsibilities and repercussions of living under that regime. This book may have been categorized for young adults but it is the only book that I can remember that made me cry.  I started the book because of my interest in modern German history.  However, what I got out of this beautiful book was something far different-a very emotional experience.
 Loved this book... I liked the narrative and point of view of this book.  I also like how the writer lets you in on the story and gives you info about how it'll all end, but still keeps the story interesting and when events actually happen, you're not surprised, saddened or glad any less.  Descriptions are detailed enough to let your imagination roam free and really "see" the scenes... I love when a book transports me like that.  Great story full of love and hope, in the midst of horrific Nazi Germany's times...
 This's a wonderful book, I cried over the end, her not having told her foster parents she loved them.  That really moved me to tears.  The book led me to wanting to see the film, and I did.  From the beginning of the book, I understood that the one "speaking" was the Spirit of Death, for lack of a better name. One didn't have to be Jewish to have to be in hiding; she was the<br/>daughter of a Communist. She'd've been thrown into a death camp.
 In spite of the fact that this was just another WWII novel, which my book club has expressed over-saturization of, the book was unique in perspective. It gave a glimpse of Jew sympathizers, Nazi retaliation, the plight of the civilains in war Germany, and much more. I appreciated that the characters had character and were not perverted humans as it seems is the goal of modern books.
 The reading of this book broke my heart.  My daughter insisted I watch the movie. Luckily she had watched the movie about six times and could explain some things.  We both sobbed at the ending. But nothing compared it to the ending of the book . I was alone and could shed my tears in private.  Part of the tears were because our ansesters  came from Germany. I would love to correspond with the author. My email is byoung9620@aol.com. Thank you for writing this heartbreaking book.
 From the description, I thought this might be a "kids' book" but I couldn't have been more wrong. It did not talk down or lower itself to be understood. It was simple, eloquent and full of description which I often find annoying but which added immeasurably to this novel. There was just enough lightness to perfectly balance the grim subject matter without trivializing it. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>A note on Kindle formatting: I noticed very few errors but the pages would occasionally look wonky to accommodate Death's 'announcements'. Not a big deal and didn't distract noticeably.<br/><br/>If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!
 This was such an emotionally charged story of a young German girl placed in a foster home during World War II.  Her relationship with her foster father, Papa, was so heart warming.  In the midst of all the chaos he was always there for her, as was her friend Rudy. Her love of reading was such a huge force in the story.<br/>The one thing that really bothered me was the profanity which was used throughout the book.  This book was labeled for ages 12 and up and no 12 year old should read this book.  I would say for ages 18 and up.
 I had always been curious as to what this book is about, but hadn't been able to have the urge to read it until a few days ago.  What a story!  I loved it from beginning to end and am now curious about the movie. Here are the things I loved about it:<br/><br/>1. The narrator.  The Collector of Souls gives his own two cents while telling the story, not leaving out how busy he was during WWII and the Holocaust; not to mention how busy he is every day.  He provides comedy, comfort, and charm that gives the book it's edge.  Even though he gives away the ending in the beginning, the reader still sticks around for the story.<br/><br/>2. The time period. WWII and the Holocaust are pieces of history that have always grabbed my attention, and this book holds true.<br/><br/>3. The characters. Liesel may not have had the best luck in life, but it makes for great entertainment as her story is told and we learn to love even the most gritty of people on Himmel Street.
 I haven't finished it yet, and it has quite the different format, almost like interjected scene directions for a play. If it improves, I'll change my rating, but so far, the beginning is difficult to warm up to.
 A great story. All of the suffering that took place in Germany during The War was completely heartbreaking and this story allows the reader to catch a glimpse of that pain. It also wasn't short on inspiration. As an avid reader how could I not get on board with a book where words were essentially one of the characters!!? My only issue was with the narration. I had no problem that the story was told from Death's perspective, but why jump ahead and reveal so much??!! I think the end would have hit much harder had I not been told ahead of time. READ THIS BOOK!!
 The Book Thief is definitely one of the best books I have read!  I even read it aloud to my husband, who was born in Germany in 1941 and could relate to many of the events and ideas expressed in the book.  This author has an amazing talent for helping readers produce vivid imagery in their minds.  The characters are so described that you feel you almost know them.  I cried much throughout the saddest parts.  After I read the book, we saw the movie, which was also excellent.  I am so glad I read the book beforehand, for it helped us understand so much more in the movie and could have many more details than the movie could!
 As I began reading, I thought, no.. this is not what I expected but the poetry of the words kept me intrigued enough to continue and I am so very glad I did.  I have never read a book filled with such eloquent descriptions of horrible and mind numbing events.  The way in which "Death" speaks to you becomes real, his words fluid, his images are felt in the imaginations deepest pool.<br/><br/>Amid the fracas of emotional turmoil are quips alarmingly funny.  I would attempt to repeat several but out of context they lose their bite and that is something I would never do to the words so carefully crafted.<br/><br/>Never have I been more filled with the desire to talk with someone about a book.  Not only is it worth a read but it is worth a reread and I'm certain that a third read is in store for me.
 As touching as it is creative, this is a story about stories, and the way they shape us and help us understand the events in our own lives. It is also a revealing insight into what life may have been like for regular folks in southern Nazi Germany (they weren't all Nazis). Our little heroine is a brave and defiant young lady, but also respectful and obedient to those she loves. This is a wonderful novel and will certainly contribute to the extremely important mission of never forgetting the Holocaust.
 I love, love this book so wanted a copy for my bookshelf after I finished the kindle version. This book is really used and in very rough condition.
 I know what is feels like to not have a good book to read. Loved every word of it. So thankful for my first grade teacher, who taught us how to sound out our words instead of see the bird, see the word. Thanks for the school library and all the libraries that give the children of the world the opportunity to loose themselves in good books where they eventually find themselves.  I LOVE GOOD BOOKS.t
 Not much to say. I liked it, a bit tedious and predictable. The girl is an annoying brat at times. I appreciate the kindness shown to this Jewish man in light of the danger it put everyone in. The brutality and insane behavior of Nazi Germany. How books and reading can bring people out of their circumstances if only for a brief moment to hope and dream. How the smallest of gestures can inspire such heartwarming joy. When make something out of nothing to show your love. Very uplifting.
 This was a book club pick.  I recommend.  I did see the movie many years ago but forgot how difficult the subject.<br/><br/>The author did an excellent job.
 This was well written and easy to follow.  I recommended that my 15 year old Granddaughter, who is an avid reader, read this particular book.  Mainly because she has no idea of what people went through at the start of WWII.  I have also recommened this to several of my adult friends who read all the time.  I know this was made into a movie, but reading the book is always more beneficial to the whole experience of the story.  There is only so much that can be put on the screen in the time alloted.  Reading uses your mind and imagination.
 This book about Nazi Germany told a story of a young orphan girl and the town she came to inhabit.  It emphasized the importance of reading and knowledge.  It portrayed her German foster parents as loving though mother and father were very different in the ways in which they showed their love.  It emphasized the importance of friendship and the strength it offers.  It showed that morality is not a question of black or white, but, that there are circumstances where immoral acts are necessary.  Finally, it portrayed a family that had to do what they believed was right even though it was extremely dangerous.
 I'm usually an action/adventure reader, but sometimes enjoy something different and I found it.  I LOVE the point of view it was written from--both the narrator and the characters who are (with the exception of 1) Germans during WWII.  The perspective of the narrator was fabulous and got me thinking.  I loved how he associated and remembered events in terms of color...what an idea! (You'll know what I mean if you read it.)  Characters were wonderful, unique, individuals that will stay with me for a long time.  I cried several times while reading and I can't remember the last time that happened.  If you like history and a good novel with heart, this is one for you.  Just for the record, I did not see the movie.
 I think because I read 200 or so books a year, I know when one deserves a 5 Star review. And if I  could write a book, it would be as good as this.  Highly recommend.

In that aspect it reminded me a lot of "Dead Like Me" which I used to love! I loved how throughout the story my opinion of some of the characters I disliked in the beginning changed and I really grew to love them at the end!<br/><br/>***** more book reviews can be found at www.goodreads.com/xorubituesdays *****
 This is among the most stunning books I've ever read.  The author's unique ability to play with words in such a way that together they capture and create atmosphere is amazing.  Having read numerous books about the horrible period of history that Germany in WWII was, the narrative provided by 'death' brings a totally new perspective.  The main character - a 12 year old girl is richly captured in all of her complexity and innocence, as are the events of her life.  Perhaps a sequel is in the works?  One can only hope as the reader is left wondering how the rest of her life transpired.  I highly recommend this book - prepare to be captivated by the writing first, and the story as well.
 This was not the most comfortable story to read, as I do not like to dwell on the awful war.  It does give an insight to the opposite side of affairs in the world at the time.  Having lived in Germany in the 50's since my father was stationed near Wiesbaden, I have some memories of my own!  Of course, I never had the deprivation that Liesel and her family and friends  suffered.  I was just a child myself in first grade.  I do remember the ruined buildings and the stench.<br/>I like the way that being a "book thief" gave her a reason to live on.<br/>A very interesting point of view!
 The human race has proven to be, all at once, terribly atrocious and profoundly lovely. Unfortunately for Death (the narrator of this story), as one of the major distresses of the job, he is inevitably present for all of the former and VERY little of the latter. Particularly, in Nazi Germany, Death is an extremely busy witness to fear, anger, despair, genocide and, as a result, is terrified of humans.<br/><br/>However, in this setting of consternation and darkness, Mr. Zusak centers the story of The Book Thief around a tale of kindness, enduring love, personal and familial strength as well as a blinding glimpse of the unspeakable ability of the human spirit to persevere. As one reads this richly ambitious novel, there will be moments within the emotional experience of the reader destined to enlighten, sadden, encourage and devastate. Those who finish The Book Thief, will surely understand (and be thankful) why Death embraced Leisel Meminger's story as an act of hope and empathy to share with all of us; just as Leisel would do.
 I purchased this book for a friend's 12-year-old daughter, and I know she loved it because she couldn't stop talking about it! Each time I saw her, she would tell me exactly what had happened so far in the book. She really enjoyed it and finished it relatively quickly.
 I had to read this book for a high school English assignment and was assigned to write two annotations per page. Even after this grusome assignment, it was still by far the bast book I read in high school. I bough this copy for my dad, and he loves it! As he's an English literature major, this is no easy feat. The narration- and narrator- of this book is absolutely fantastic!
 The story is narrated by Death- an unusual way to tell a story.  Aside from Death's busy job at that time picking up souls, Death had become a witness to the life of Liesel. I found the story slow in progression esp in the beginning. It took me a while to finish the book just because the story was dragging. I think the story picked up quite a bit when Max left Himmel Street. The last few chapters though was very emotionally charged. Although this is fiction, I have always been drawn to read about World War 2 and have always been curious about Germans who themselves were victims to the Fuhrer's "words" and craziness.  Highly recommended even  for young teens and young adults.
 It took me a while to get into the book but once I understood that Death is telling the story it became one of the best I have ever read.  The movie is just as good and almost true to the book which is nice to see.  I highly recommend that everyone read this and think about the events that it is about as the things really did happen and could happen again if we don't keep watch on prejudices. The book is a novel but could have easily happened in real life.  The girl (the book thief) is a wonderful example of just plain good people as are the people she loves.
 I don't know that I have thought this about a book before, but it felt like an absolute privilege to be able to read "The Book Thief" by Markus Zusak. It was the first selection of our new book group, and I think it will be a hard act to follow. The book is so imaginative and lyrical--just amazing when you consider it is narrated by Death and takes place in Nazi Germany. The author is so inventive in his style and narration--he tells you almost from the beginning what is going to happen, and it still catches you by surprise. The characters are unforgettable. I also don't remember ever learning so much from a work of fiction--not about history so much as human nature. Also, for anyone who loves reading, this is a book about the power of words.
 If you're looking for a page-turner, I don't think this book is it. The writing is beautiful but until the last 15% of the book I never felt like I had to keep reading. Regardless, I'd recommend it, and it offers some very pretty prose about a very difficult and dark subject
 The Book Thief is the #1 bestseller written by the brilliant author, Markus Zusak. This dark tale takes place in Molching, Germany during World War 2. The main character, Liesel Meminger is a young girl who witnesses her brother's death and is sent to live with adoptive parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann. In her new home on Himmel street, Liesel has to face the struggle of living her new life with a tough love mother, accept the fact that she will not see her mother again, and try to get over her brother's death. On a happier note, she will soon be attached to her new father Hans, a generous painter who treats Liesel like his own. Along the way, she will meet the obnoxious Rudy Steiner, a young boy who becomes Liesel's best friend. Later in the novel, Liesel will also meet a young man named Max Vanderburg, a Jew who will hide in the Hubermann's basement and develop a meaningful friendship with Liesel. This novel would be classified as historical fiction due to the time period and fictional characters. The tone of the novel is dark yet hopeful at the same time. Although there are many sad situations that the characters go through, glimmers of hope are seen here and there. The mood of the book is depressing due to many variables. The book takes place during WW2 in Nazi Germany and reveals the ugly truth of Hitler's reign. The point of view is 3rd person omniscient and is narrated by Death. The intended audience ranges from teenagers because the book is easy to read, to history fanatics because a lot can learned about WW2 after reading this book. I loved this book because of the characters, Death's perspective, and the powerful message it sends to readers. I agreed with the purpose of this novel because the author intended to give an accurate description of the brutality of World War 2 in detail. The author did a fantastic job of writing this masterpiece because he told an interesting story along with sending a message about the horrors of WW2. The only complaint I have is that the end of the book is a little too depressing and could have ended on a happier note. This change would make all of the readers happier and allow them to enjoy the book more. Overall, the book is worth your time!
 I can't tell you much about the book without giving away the story, but this was an amazing read. Many books and movies about this subject take the view point of the persecuted jewish person as narrator. This book tells the story from the viewpoint of a young German girl who does not see what separates her as a person from a Jewish individual. It is about humanity without titles. The narrator, however, is Death himself.<br/>The movie was a terrible disappointment.
 History as we are told it is often the story of ruler, or class of rulers, be they heroes or be they villians.  Of course one's point-of-view makes the decision for one.  As one great history teacher has taught me, it is the lives of the ordinary people I believe that is most important.  Consider the suffering of the enemies of Nazi Germany, England, France, Belgium, Luxemborg, Belgium, etc. etc., and also consider the suffering of the German ordinary people.  In neither case did these ordinary people ask for all the hardship and suffering which befell them and they were powerless to prevent or to stop it.  But is that any different from our lives today?
 Unlike The Messenger, this book by Markus Zusak proceeds in an innocent manner, telling of a young girl who must survive without her family. Although she continues to have a difficult life, there is safety in her relationships with few that grow throughout the story. For those who have read many stories about WWII and the Holocaust, this story sheds a different light on the time period in Germany. Definitely a worthwhile read!
 This book was captivating. It so well described the other side of World War 2. The Germans who didn't support Hitler and what he was doing to the Jews. What torture it was for them to witness the inhumanity of it all. It is written from a totally different perspective than one would expect,,,,that of death himself and his view of what went on and the part he played.
 This book tells a tale about life in Nazi Germany for the citizens who were not Nazi's, and not Jews.  It was written in short chapters and is very readable.  It addresses the poor class in poor neighborhoods.  The fears of the people, including a Jew that was being hidden in the protagonist's basement, were shown realistically.  The story depicted the terror people felt about the bombs that were being dropped.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in human history.  It would be a valuable addition to high school reading lists.
 I didn't think I'd ever read a take on Nazi Germany that felt new, different, innocent as the view of this one little German girl, her adoptive parents, friends, neighbors . . . her whole town . . . and from the point of view of Death!  This book is a MUST READ.  I just know that I stayed up all night and through the following day and night totally engaged in, and amazed by, this story . . . the writing . . . the point of view.  Just buy it or borrow it -  just read it!!!!
 This is a wonderful,story of hardship, friendship, love and loss and keeping secrets. Saw the movie first which inspired me to read the book. The movie was great, but the book has much more detail. A young 9-year-old girl goes to live with poor foster parents in Nazi Germany during WWII. She learns to read from her kind foster father and becomes obsessed with books. She begins "borrowing" books from a well-to-do neighbor and shares them with the young Jewish refugee hidden in her foster parent's basement.
 I had two people I trust recommend this in a two-week period, which means I got my butt to a bookstore. And I'm glad I did; this is an exceptional read, one of those sneaky books that distracts you with warmth while it sneaks behind and cuts your heart out. Vonnegut is the closest parallel I can think of, and that's not a name I drop lightly.<br/><br/>Liesel Meminger is a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany. In an era when, using little but words and will, Hitler has remade a nation into a horrorshow, Liesel's chief comfort is found in the books she steals, as well as the friendships she forms in her working class neighborhood.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and did I mention the story is narrated by Death? Highly recommended.
 I heard this book was for young adults, but decided to give it a try after seeing an ad in the NYT's that highlighted some glowing reviews.  While the reviews got me excited to read this book, they didn't even come close to capturing how extraordinary this book is.  I'd have to say "The Book Thief" is one of the most wonderful books that I've read in recent memory.  Also, don't let the fact that the book is labeled as young adult stop you from reading it - this is better than most "adult" fiction books you can pick up.<br/><br/>The story takes place in a small town outside of Munich, during WWII.  The narrator of the story is death, first introduced to us as nine year old Liesel Meminger witnesses the death of her younger brother, as they are sent to live with foster parents.  Liesel is illiterate, but after she witnesses the death of her brother she picks up a book, "The Gravedigger's Handbook", and winds up hiding under her mattress at her new foster parents, Hans and Rosa.  Ultimately, we see the relationship of Hans and Liesel  develop as he spends nights reading to her and teaching her to read.  Liesel's love of books is kindled and shortly later, she begins her book "thievery" starting at a Nazi book burning and continuing with a relationship she develops with the mayor's wife.<br/><br/>While I won't go into much more detail about the plot, there are several things that endeared this book to me.  The first is the well-rounded and developed characters that Zusak creates - from Liesel, to her best friend Rudy and the young Jewish boy Max that Rosa and Hans hide in their basement.  Second, Zusak re-creates wartime Munich and the surrounding area with such detail that I'd find myself closing my eyes after reading the chapters and transporting myself to this horrible time and place.  Finally, Zusak's use of death as the narrator was a master stroke for this book.  However, it is not just his use of death as the narrator, but attributes of death.  Death is not a vengeful, mean, evil force in "The Book Thief", but a removed, dispassionate observer - even aghast at what is happening in this terrible time and place.<br/><br/>My words certainly do this book justice.  From the hilarious irony of Rudy smearing himself in charcoal and emulating Jesse Owens to the cruelty of Liesel and Rudy hiding in a parade of Jews through Munich to feed them stale bread, this is one remarkable novel.  Make time for this book - it will leave an indelible mark with you.
 Being a 46'er and having learned all about WWII, I found this book captivating.  It certainly paints a picture of the tragedy that wars bring on human beings.  The plight of a young girl and her thirst to learn to read - those around her teaching and allowing her to learn.  This book is very involved, it moves from era to era and person to person in a fascinating pros form.<br/>If you are looking for an easy read, don't bother buying this book, but if you are looking for something challenging, then this book is for you.  WOW, I found it a wonderful read.
 I gave this book four stars because of the simple fact that it is kinda slow. In the beginning it is super draggy then it picks up and then the end is slow again. other than that I would say this book was great and was as very interesting read. I definitely learned a lot of German from this book and also learned a lot about the German culture. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in history out even just wanting to read it before setting the movie such as I did. Truly a great story. I am so glad I read it. You will be too.
 If you haven’t read this book yet, WHY?? This is a really good quick read. Five stars for sure - just know it’s on a young adult reading level.
 The Book Thief holds your attention from first page to last. It is the story of how a young girl copes with the harsh realities of life in World War II Germany by discovering the joy and comfort of words and books. This novel has an unusual narrator - Death, which adds an interesting dimension and humanity to the story. It touches the heart of anyone who has experienced hardship in their life, and leaves you with a greater sense of purpose.<br/>I haven't seen the movie yet but don't know if it can possibly be as spectacular as the book!
 This is a beautifully balanced piece of storytelling with glimpses of what is yet to come: sometimes misleading, sometimes all too true. We meet all shades of German, from truly committed Nazis to the likes of Hans Hubermann. Zusak is no apologist, but able to give a remarkable insight into the human psyche.
 What a delightful discovery! I was at first intrigued by the title, only to find out reading that this is a great story of surviving and fighting for one's identity and values. This is not just a book for young readers, but for readers of all ages. There is a touch of humor, a lot of historical details, and above all the complicated relationships among all the characters. I cannot wait to watch the movie; I only hope it is as good as the book (with movies, that is not always the case). Treasure this book and share it with your children.
 I must confess I almost didn't read this book. My perception was that it was another trite re-hash of one of history's most horrific times.  Not so. this may well be the finest book I have read. It draws you into a world of imagery, grief, and stolen pockets of innocence and happiness in Hitler era Germany.  Even Death is impressed with the integrity of those he harvests. The strength of the written word comes to life both in the plot, and in the author's skillful narrative
 A special read.  Powerfully and unusually written.  The way it was written from the "reaper's" point of view was captivatingly different.  I was sure that the Author had been there.... I chose this rating because of the way the story told the tale of the ordinary German, who would help a Jew, even to the possible detriment of his family.  It showed the human aspect of people experiencing the extreme hardship of War.  We have been able to watch and read numerous tales from the Allied side of the War but not much is available describing things from a German perspective.  How to survive trauma and loss is a theme running through this book - from The Book Thief herself, to the Mayor's wife...I congratulate the Author on a wonderfully written and positive story.
 Very unusual book but it was highly recommended on all the book sites that I follow so I thought I would give it a try. I'm sure glad I did. I think it's especially good for a high school English class. So much to analyze and pull apart. Find a place in your library. It's worth it!
 I purchased this book for my 13 year old daughter.  It is a required reading book for her English class this year.  Since it seemed to be a fairly substantial book, I decided to read it over the summer so I could help her along in the event that she struggled.  By the third page I was hooked.  This book is a wonderful story about friendships and relationships during very difficult times.  I feel that after having read it, my life has been changed.  Since having read it, I loaned it out to my other two daughters and my mother.  Because the book was so well read, I had to purchase a new copy for my 13 year old's class...
 This story is all the more heart-wrenching because it is so ordinary. Liesel Meminger is not heroic, or especially talented, or beautiful, she is just an ordinary good German girl trying to survive the horrors of World War II. It will stay with you long after the last page is turned.<br/><br/>The author was clever to make death the narrator of her tale, and he used interjections that reminded me of Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut. My only quibble is that it seemed overly long, I thought the middle could have used some editing.
 I don't know how to do 4 and one half so left it at 4.  The only reason I did not give this book a 5 is because it has the strangest beginning of any book I have read.  It's so out of no where - i had no clue who this was, what was happening.  I had it on my Kindle and while I knew it wasn't possible, I literally thought to myself - did it all not download onto my kindle?  What is going on?  I almost stopped reading thinking i was simply not going to like the book - and yes while I did not love the :formatting of the book - the story itself was beautifully written.  Character building was well done and I found it thought provoking (am I a brave person - not sure i am)....a GREAT read.  I would (and have) recommended it to others.
 "Death" narrates this story and is a constant "companion" of the characters around the book thief.  The story is based on the life of an adolescent Jewish girl with a fierce determination to live, to care, and to find meaning in her life in Germany.  The story is unusual and very well crafted weaving the characters with the setting.  The reader will remember these characters and "feel they knew them".  This true story is a "new telling" with "new insight".
 This is a book that sneaks up on you.  You realize you are seeing the holocaust from a completely different perspective than you ever have and then it becomes apparent that this is a very powerful and effective way to convey the horror and absurdity of war and the way that individual acts can still matter in a sea of military and political uniformity.  This is certainly not a children's book nor is it's importance or appeal to be diminished with the label of "young adult" literature.  It is literature plain and simple and a rewarding, powerful, enlightening and entertaining read for anyone old enough to appreciate and  understand it.<br/>One of the best books I've read this or any other year.
 I loved this book.  Well, I didn't finish the book, but I loved the part I read.  I was reading this for book club and ran out of time, so I watched the movie.  I like the author's writing style and will be reading more of his works.  This time period, and the atrocities that were committed, is difficult to read/see/hear about.  I would recommend this book and I loved the movie as well.
 The first few pages were a struggle and a concern, however, the crazy approach began to be unimportant to plot of the story and I thoroughly enjoyed the book. War is always a tough story but the author did an excellent job of using the truth; doing justice to the horror but not leaving the reader in serious, depressing pain. The characters were very believable and well developed. You can easily imagine every character and feel like you know them. I strongly  recommend the book but only when you are in the frame of mind for something powerful.
 The writing in this book is compelling. It draws you in from the start by death and death tells his story from start to finish. It is haunting because you know it could have happened and you can feel the weight of death that hung over Europe during World War II. You experience everyday, average people who had nothing but suffering and for no reason. And the clever use of books and words to tie the story together makes it all the more interesting. The power of words is evident. Read this book. You can't go wrong.
 I just finished reading The Book Thief about five minutes ago. The only words to describe how I feel are numb, happy, and sad at the same time. I don't think I've ever read a book that had such an affect on me. I could barely get through to the final pages of the book. It was so hard. The characters in it are so lifelike and relatable you feel like you've known them your whole life as close friends and family. Death as the narrator was amazing. The simplicity of words used to describe situations is what has the biggest impact. It's brutally beautiful. If you haven't read this book yet I highly suggest you do. It's going to be one that I will remember from day to day and re-read in the future.
 The story told by Death, of a German child during ww11. The writer invents a language that takes the reader to unknown emotions.<br/>The girl is sent with her younger brother to live with foster parents. The brother dies before they get there.<br/>The parents are welcoming but the road to feeling settled isn't easy. The father soon finds the way to her heart.<br/>The author describes the atmosphere, the emotions, scenery, the weathet in the most original way. He uses the language as though it is soft clay, making it do wonderful things to the imagination.<br/>In Nazi Germany, life for the people living in poverty is devastating. The goodness that can be found in the least likely places is found when a young, desparate Jew is allowed to hide in the foster parents meagre home.<br/>Read and enjoy.
 The heartwrenching story carries you along the journey with death as your chauffeur. The story offers a unique perspective of one of the darkest times of humanity. The author carefully crafts characters with souls that draw you in. Although it is fiction, you see what innocent people living in Germany during WWII, surely grappled with while trying to survive.  The author's greatest strength is the imagery.  You truly feel present at each event.  Despite its necessary sadness, it somehow warms your heart, and like death, will haunt you long afterward....a worthy read, for sure.
 This is one of the most moving and memorable books I have ever read. The characters will remain with me for a long time, I'm sure.  I enjoyed the fictional story of the young girl, Leisel, whose struggle is wrapped up in the historical events of WWII.  So that we don't forget the real people who lived and died during this war, the story is told from the perspective of common folk in Germany, who are most often painted with the same supremacist brush as Hitler, yet, forgotten as the co-victims of a tyrant.  The story highlights the human factor----family, enduring love, sacrifice, and devotion---all of which are present,<br/>simultaneously, with war, death and destruction. This story is destined to be a classic as people discover it for generations to come.
 I admit that when I started this book I was put off. I didn't get the whole death narrative and am sad to admit that I put it down a few pages in and only picked it up once I had run out of other books. Having just now finished this book I am so sad I didn't go farther the first time! I am a bit of a wwii buff so I have read countless stories about the Holocaust and Nazi Germany. But the narrative is beautiful in this story! The sketches and stories shared by Liesle and Max... Deaths take on the whole situation, the poetic prose of it all... it came together beautifully. I am a bit surprised that this is recommended to young readers. While I feel it is important I also feel that they might miss some of the deeper themes. All in all I am in love with this book. I think I will check out more by this author.
 A very unique Holocaust story through the eyes of a young girl and the powerful narrator. A story of love, loss and courage and finding a place to belong. The writing is metaphorical, descriptive and emotional. I could feel the cold and bleakness, the constant hunger and scrapping, tentative friendships and the overwhelming kindness and patience of a foster father who always does the right thing regardless of the cost. The story and characters are so imaginative and I am in awe of those who suffered so greatly but whose spirits were not broken.
 I finished reading the Book Theif last. It was one of those that I just couldn't put down even though I knew I needed to go to sleep. It was one of those books that reaches in and grabs your heart and squeezes as hard as it can. Where you wanted to look away but you just couldn't, knowing the next page is going to break your heart more than the page before.
 This was a book club selection and I'm supremely happy! In my critiques I will not go into detail about the people, places or story parts - this I feel detracts and could deter people from reading by giving it away and not having the reader immerse themselves in the story. What I found utterly refreshing about HOW the book was written is WHO is telling the story. By the end I felt very sympathetic towards him and his job. It's the telling of a part of history from a very different angle.  This is one of my favorite books of all time.
 I only gave this book four stars because I had a little trouble getting started, but I stuck with it and it was well worth it. I really came to know and understand the characters, even the not so lovable ones (ie Mama and Mayors wife). My favorite part was Papa teaching Leisl to read, then when she read to the bomb shelter patrons.  I was disappointed in the ending, although I knew it was coming. I have never read a book from death's point of view so I found it both morbid yet fascinating. I hope to read more of this author in the future.
 This book was written in a very interesting way, captured my attention, and in the end stole my heart.  I started reading and found that I was over 200 pages into the book without realizing it.  The characters are well defined, the story has historical ties, and I found myself caught up in the lives of these people.  Can't imagine that the movie can do as good a job with the story so I don't intend to see it.  I do, however, intend to recommend and share this book with as many of my friends and family as are interested.  Worth the read!
 My friend recommended this book to me before I went away on vacation. I was looking for books to read while on vacation and on the plane. I ended up reading this book on my 7 hour plane ride home from Spain. This is Young Adult Fiction, but it was written extremely well. The story is very compelling, and touching. I was tearing up in my plan seat as we touched down. Great read for adults, as well as older young adults (I'd recommend for 8th grade and up).
 I am 48 years old and I find this a very interesting book especially the concept of  the "person" narrating the book.<br/>.<br/>I have found that I can actually visualize and feel for the characters in this book. unlike some books I read, and just read for the plot.<br/><br/>well played, Mr Zusak.<br/>.....<br/><br/>I have no idea how I keep ordering books and they end up being a movie in the works... funny....as it is NOT how I choose them.
 Everything about human nature is covered. You find yourself wondering how such beauty can come out of such horror.  This is a amazingly wonderful book. But be prepared to learn something about yourself.
 I bought this as a audio book, and with all the Christmas music and activites, I have been battling my guilt over listening to it over the other.<br/>This is so captivating and if no one is with me in my vehicle, it is on full time.  This is a wonderful story, and unfortunately, so realistic that it breaks my heart.<br/>If young people today (especially, but not only) could get a little slice of heart and story of the history of our world, they would never feel they have problems like those of the people in this time.<br/>The thing I absolutely loved about this book is that it is from an insiders look of being German, surrounded by Nazi when they don't have the evil in their hearts, so they live in constant persecution, loss of work and possible death if they show they are sympathizers for Jewish Germans-but they do anyway.<br/>The reader of this book is amazing and I feel so blessed that this book jumped in front of me to read!
 I've read many books but none so poignant and moving as this book. It was horrific as war stories often are but it was beautiful as people stories often are. I believe I'll never read a book that will touch me quite the way this book did and for that I'm both grateful and sad. But I'll continue to read for if nothing else this book tells me I'm a saukerl if I don't an arschloch and a Sheisskopf to the coreif I don't pursue the written word for I now realize more now than I ever realized before that I too am a 'Word Shaker'!
 The premise of this book is very interesting-the story of a little girl in Nazi Germany whose family is hiding a Jew, told from the point of view of Death. However, the beginning of the book is difficult to really sink your teeth into as it is just short choppy sentences and vaguely connected thoughts rather than a cohesive story. If you make it past this is gets progressively better and riveting by the end. I left off a star mainly due to the ruining of certain plot points by blunt foreshadowing. The effects of these plot points would have been more profound had you not expected them for 200 pages.
 The narrator was death, so it was no shocker that the ending was going to be depressing.  Because of the narrator, it took the element of surprise out of the book.  Even though the book was depressing, it was well written and interesting.  One of the reasons why I liked the book was because the main character stole books.  Another reason was that the main characters bravery was inspiring.  The third reason why I enjoyed this book was the fact that the narrator was death.  I actually started to like him for his brutally honest and haunting story telling.
 This book is extremely well-written. It is the story of the early life of a young German girl adopted by a couple in Nazi Germany. As she learns to love her new family and make new friends in a world where fear and inhumanity abide, she is watched over by a unique and surprising character (who I cannot name without spoiling the story). It is beautifully written. It encompasses all of the human emotions: fear, joy, sadness - but in the end I just felt satisfied. This book is appropriate for younger teens.
 This book, apparently based upon a real-life story, is written in a intimate way about a three year old child that is sent to a foster home when her mother disappears, actually is arrested as a Bolshevik. Liesel grows up in a home where there is much love, and rather complex family relationships. They are anti-Nazi, and she learns how to survive as Nazism progresses to cruel fanaticism. Her foster father adores her and teaches her to read.  She becomes absorbed with reading.<br/><br/>Once you start reading this book, you won't be able to put it down.
 Here is a perspective you don't see every day: Life inside Nazi Germany told from the perspective of a German civilian. At first they are swept along by the rising tide of nationalism and pride and chanting "Heil Hitler" like everyone else.  Gradually as they realize what is going on, this starts to change.  I won't include spoilers and details on how this change occurs but I was glad I read this book.<br/><br/>Narration by the character "Death" threw me off at first but this is one book I'll be reading again.
 My 10-year old granddaughter recommended this book to me!  The sadness of WWII was powerfully written in this book.  My granddaughter amazes me with her book interests and she knows what I might enjoy too.  This was a good read, albeit sad.
 This book depicts the life of a young orphaned girl in Nazi Germany during World War II; from the perspective of the Grim Reaper... not in a creepy way... just very unique.  While the theme of the book is sad, it does have its uplifting moments and aptly portrays the goodness that exists between the cracks of evil.  The book is a quick, easy read.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I felt it was written "simply" and could have used a little more depth and complexity.<br/>I still enjoyed the book and am glad I read it.
 I want to thank my friends that encouraged me not to give up on this book when I hit a lag in the middle. They were right, it is a great book. I am giving it only 4 stars because I am not crazy about the format, the middle moved a little slowly for me and I am not personally fond of the narrator (death). That being said, the characters were wonderful. I loved that idea that Hans was warm &amp; kind unlike most foster fathers in novels, Rosa was multifaceted, as we all are, and Rudy, well, he was...more
 Fantastic story line with an admirable discriptive quality. This book certainly fosters compassion for the independent German families who cared for the displaced children of this time. Every event/war/celebration/accomplishment/failure acquires multiple facets. This book portrays several facets at once. I would highly recommend this book to any student in or above junior high. I couldn't put this book down and I'll soon be reaching a half a century. Definitely give this book as a gift to you. someone else, or a even an entire class.
 I am afraid to see the movie because the book was so amazing.  It was a book filled with loss, hope, love, friendship, dedication and sorrow. Set in Germany during the height of WWII, it was very hard to read at times because of the atrocities of the war, but the author wove the main characters in such a way that you will fall in love with them and feel all the emotions they were feeling during this horrible time of history.  I would HIGHLY reading this before you see the movie as sometimes movies just can't do a book justice.
 This was an amazing story giving a glimpse of the worst of times (WWII) and the best of human nature. Told from the perspective of a child, the story tells of her struggle to survive and the many people who were part of life.  I was sad when the book ended and wanted the saga to continue indefinitely.  I highly recommend this compelling novel.
 Loved this novel!  The character development and wording drew you in as a reader.  Using death as the narrator was very clever and unique.  You are reminded of the impact of war on ordinary citizens.  And you are reminded that all citizens do not believe what the politicians are selling.  Just because these characters lived in Nazi Germany didn't mean they were Nazis.  I couldn't put it down and am hoping the movie comes even close to being as well done as the book is well written.
 Very interesting book, different, but worth reading.<br/>The beginning is very strangely written...still have not figured out who is suppose to be writing this book...is it the Grim Reaper?  Then it definitely goes into the person of The Book Thief, herself....then the ending goes back to the person of the Grim Reaper, I suppose. I did not like how the story does not let us know the rest of her story; thus, leaving too much to our own imagination.<br/>This is a wonderful portrayal of how the German people were under the awful Nazi rule...you really get the feel for what it was like to live in this time period....
 I am not a crier.<br/><br/>I rarely cry. I will get upset at times, but I don't really cry -- ESPECIALLY not because of books or movies.<br/><br/>This book was assigned to me for a school summer reading book, and -- though I enjoy reading -- I always dread the books my school assigns. When I started this book, I was uninterested on principle, and refused to acknowledge I was actually interested until quite a bit into it. I ended up loving this book, more than I have ever loved a school assigned book in the past, and it changed the way I see things.<br/><br/>This is one of those books that will stay with you forever, that will pop into your mind at moments through life even if you haven't thought about it for a while. It is just a book that is meant to be read.<br/><br/>And, though I am not a crier, I was up a two a.m., sobbing, as I read the last two beautiful, terrible chapters. But the emotional turmoil was worth it.<br/><br/>Just.<br/><br/>Read it.
 There was something sort of magical about this book. Certainly it was interesting, a book written from the point of view of Death. And it was about a German girl in Nazi Germany during WW II. Set in the poor section of a small town, it was simple, charming, filled with love. I couldn't stop thinking about the characters, worrying about them, wondering what would happen next. You should read it.<br/><br/>On a side note: I didn't care for the photo on the book cover. It didn't look like a poor, underfed child living in rural Germany in the 1940s.
 I am a 15 year old guy and I have read many fandom series...<br/>*Harry Potter<br/>*Hunger games<br/>*Percy Jackson<br/>*Divergent<br/>*The fault in our stars<br/>*etc...<br/>and I can honestly say that as in individual book, this was my favorite. I can not put it above an entire series such as harry potter but it is written in the most intriguing way and is so clever. I have been telling everybody to read it because I loved it so much. Do so and buy it now.
 When a friend told me about this book, I was skeptical as Death is the narrator during Nazi Germany. When another friend told me she was going to keep this book for her library as it was one of the best books she has read, I decided to try it. The further you get into the story the better it gets. The characters are well-developed and believable.  I would highly recommend this book.
 Of course, the Narrator being "Death" is a tad hard to come to grips with, considering how many hundreds of thousands of people "he" had to pick up, so one wonders how he could spend so much time with Liesel and her foster family, and Max, etc.  Other than that, it is a wonderful book.  I just read it for the 2nd time on my Kindle.  I have a question that no one who has read it can answer.  Who came into Max's shop, asking for Liesel, and fell into her arms?  Assuming it was who she married, but all her loves died, except Max.  I may never know, and that's okay, but I know "Death" took her best friend.<br/><br/>Loved the book, can't wait to watch the movie!
 Excellent book. I didn't realize when my book group picked it that it is a young adult book. Good for adults too, we all enjoyed it. Well written and an interesting story from the perspective of people in a small village who were not really a part of all that was happening around them except as they were forced to be. A few people didn't like the parts with the narrator because they didn't like how those parts were written. I didn't mind them and they aren't in a lot of the book.
 Although the central character in The Book Thief is Liesel Meminger, the narration for the duration of the novel is done by Death. So Death's point of view understands and seems to know all about who he will meet along the way in Nazi Germany. Death is neither overly sentimental (a few exceptions of course apply) nor acutely malevolent or terrifying. He's just a voice that accepts the many ways people come to him, one way or another, and in fact sits back and watches the barbarity of humans. He sees the ugliness, brutality and beauty of mankind, and seems to feel the most pity for Himmel Street, where Leisel and her new family reside. Still, he is detached, and waits for all to come to him.<br/><br/>Liesel is nine when she becomes a foster child for the Hagerman's after seeing her brother and mother die. She learns to love the new, adopted family she has, and because she has stolen The Grave Digger's Handbook from her brother's burial place, she has a fascination with books and wants to learn to read. One book isn't enough, and after Hans Huber Mann teaches her to read, she has many adventure with Rudy, neighbor boy who is a fan of Jessie Owens, stealing books and other things. Liesel becomes absorbed in novels, and each book is a symbol of an event in the story.<br/><br/>One of the more unique characters is Max Vandenburg, the Jew who hides in the Hagerman's' basement. Similar to Liesel, he comes to this house a stranger trying to make an adjustment after a difficult past experience. Max's stay at the house gives Liesel a stronger purpose because she looks after him as Hans Huber Mann once looked after her. Max connects with the child because he has a strong imagination, an introspective way of looking at things. Max gives Liesel a gift, The Standover Man, which encompasses and signifies all the ideas that link these two characters.<br/><br/>Markus Zusak has a powerful ability to create a poetic, deep narrative, using symbols, and examining the issue of courage, hope, and despair during a troubling and confusing time. Unusually written, as we are often moving back and forth in time between what the reader knows and will know, and given poems as to clues of the plot, Zusak's creates a unique story. Although you are likely to find this book in the young adult section of your bookstore, it seems pretty "mature" in its voice, and should have been left in the fiction section.<br/><br/>While there is so much more going on in the novel, there is much about the background of Nazi Germany, and those who either oppose or dissent from those ideals. Zuzak gives a haunting description of the barbarity, and hopelessness, of this oppression from the eyes of Liesel: "As she watched all of this, Liesel was certain these were the poorest souls alive...Others pleaded for someone, anyone, to step forward and catch them in their arms. No one did."<br/><br/>This is a story that is intense, and leaves an impression. A very creative story here, one that I will definitely read again. Five stars all the way.
 An amazing, quirky characters storyline, which I happen to love when I occasionally read Fiction. Well thought out storyline about a young girl living through the Hitler era, who finds solace in reading. Her father teaches his daughter how to read. I can't tell you more except to say things progress  book wise with the Book Thief!<br/><br/>Right Brain people with love this! I did and truly loved the story. Actually, I finished it in two days!
 The book Thief I am an avid reader,even tho' most readings  relate to the Shoah,I thought  that the writer chose a most interesting way to put his ideas across (the use of death f.i.)the way he presented the various persons,all of them and the protagonists in particular and got his message through,i think loud and clear.It's obviously fiction as some of thethings he describes regarding the Jews are very imprecise,but that did not matter.His insight and understanding was perfect.I am pleased I came across it quite by chance.<br/>sincerely yours, Dr.Margot Lifmann Haifa.
 not my cup of tea, read it for a book club. Just did not like it. It is shown through the eyes of a child, and it is somewhat unrealistic. I should have stopped when I realized that it is not my style, although others in the book club loved it, for many other reasons.
 Oh how I love to be captivated by a good book and hate to be finished with it! Such a marvelous rendition of daily life in Germany during WWII. The author brings you into this little family, puts you right into the head of little ten year old<br/>Liesel and brings you along to watch her grow up in an impossibly bleak time . He also helps you to understand how it was during that dark period of modern history and how people did the things they had to do merely to survive. This wonderful storyteller helps you realize that German citizens were not treated much better than the unfortunates that Hitler wanted to be rid of. I highly recommend this book as I will be keeping it in my Kindle because I'll most likely want to revisit the characters in the future.
 We have all heard the stories of the Holocaust. It happened before I was born. I am not Jewish so I can only try to understand what it all meant. Yet, when reading Zusak's account I was there. I saw Max marching with the other Jews, being herded to the concentration camp. I cried with Liesel when her papa went to war, when she cried out alone because of the nightmares and when her friends suffered . . . some died. I learned to love Rosa and the mayor's wife. Read it. We must never forget and The Book Thief will help us remember.
 I have read numerous books, by other authors, about this time in our history but never one written by this third party, Death.  The descriptions seen by a little girl of 11 years through her 14th year, were truly amazing and it was difficult to put this book down.<br/><br/>I will seek out this author's other works to see he is as wonderful in other areas.<br/><br/>I would really give this book two more stars if possible......just great!!
 I haven't seen the movie yet, but after seeing the commericals for it, and being sensitive about how Jews are portrayed on film, and always interested in seeing different perspectives, I determined to see the film but not before reading the book.<br/><br/>The book is just so wonderfully beautifully written, with a wonderful beautiful story. The turns of words and insights into character are much of what i seek and need in a book, and it was all there, with a point of view from the eyes of regular people in a desparately irregular time.
 This is a sad tale, but so well written. Words have so much power. I love Liesel's love for books. The words gave her power &amp; saved her life. This book opened up a new perspective for me.  I had not considered the perspective of the German's who did not support Hitler or what their lives must have been like. An eye opening story of being able to persevere when everything seems hopeless. Beautiful! I highly recommend this book!
 I thought The Book Thief was a sad book about the Hitler era in Nazi Germany and about the sufferings of not only the Jews but of the German people.  Many of them didn't believe as Hitler did but were almost powerless to stop him.  There were a few that tried and this is their story.  I thought that the story being told by death was a novel idea.  Death was depicted as someone who was relieving people of the pains of this mortal life not as a thing people should fear.  It was one of the best books I have read this year, not only in writing style but in content and emotion.  I loved it.
 The very least I can say about this book is that it is different from pretty much everything I have already read so far. The story happens in Germany during World War II and talks about poor people during the Nazi period, which is supposed to be a heavy theme, and yet the book manages to deliver a light, almost delicate narrative. It felt almost like reading Anne Frank's diary, but from a slightly different point of view. A fun reading, great for who is trying to escape the regular Hero's Journey.
 This was my book clubs July selection and everyone loved it. Although it was not a happy book it was very interesting. A learning experience about WWll
 Read this book!! When I downloaded the sample I found the 1st chapter a bit hard to follow, so of course I went to google to see what others thought.  Reviews were mixed, but I decided to give it a try. The story is told by the character "Death" and after the first chapter I was completely hooked. I loved this book and the writing style of the author. I could not put this book down and found myself reading for hours. Try it, buy it, love it.
 Markus Zusak, The Book Thief, delivers a story from the heart of the characters, their daily life, the fear the war brought into their lives. I understand that first person stories are most difficult. Zusak was able to deliver a story with enough realism that the characters wove their personalities into my heart.<br/>I especially enjoyed the history that gave us the understanding and terror of war. This book is a must read. I feel every high school English teacher should have their students read it.
 Good book.  Interesting to have the story told from the narrator's point of view.  And, to see the "narrator" had a sense of humor and a bit of a caustic wit.  The characters are complex which is nice to see such development.  Tragedy and humor woven together just enough to keep it interesting to the end. The expectation was a more whimsical story so was surprising it had both whimsy and tragedy.  The atrocities of mankind and the extreme selflessness of individuals is well laid out in this book.  Yet it has a sweet note to it with the girl who loves words and books.
 I lived through this war. This book,  has a totally different view . German families reacting to the  World war going  in their town, realizing,  the hatred of the German's for Jews,  that seemed to have no basis to them. Finally hiding a learned loving Jewish man in their basement when their very lives depended on, keeping their secret.<br/><br/>I chose 4 stars as this was an excellent , well written book.  But I feel  that,  few books other than prize winners are deserving of the highest five star review.  this particular book came very close.<br/>Looking forward to this authors next achievement.  Hopefully,  a 5 star.<br/><br/>Loved the character build up and the bits of humor and joy during the trying  days of  World War 11 in Germany<br/>The Accordian was a symbal,  that people can live through terrible times, if there was still music and art in their lives.<br/><br/>The relationship of the Girl, and the Jew they were saving was vivid and soul searching.
 This book was simply amazing. There is so much depth and love in it. There is beauty and pain in it. This book is a very accurate description of what life was like in World War ll. There is despair and sadness in it, but there is hope in it as well. I hope everyone who reads it falls in love with Liesel Meminger's story as I did. I would recommend this story to teens and adults. Happy Reading Everyone!!!!!
 I say unusual because the backdrop, time and place of the book should have been very disturbing which deep underneath as an adult it was.  However, living this time through the senses of this resilient child it was still charismatic and charming to read.  I know that sounds horrible to refer this way to such an atrocious time in history but the author enables us to survive this as Leisel did.  And written from the perspective of death was ingenious.  Death became a friend and an entity with which I sympathized.  Having jobs to do that it too struggled with as if human.  Very interesting, enjoyable, and thought provoking.  Highly recommended.
 The book/movie is not heavily involved in the destruction of the Jews of Europe, or the guilt of Germany.  It is rather the simple story of a sensitive teenager given up by her mother for economic or political reasons (no clear reason given) and how she and her adoptive parents face the war, anti-Semitism, and just plain human pain.<br/>I really enjoyed both the book and the movie, and highly recommend it as an excellent story and good insight into the life of common people in Nazi Germany.
 I am struck when I read this book by how much my life is impacted by the words of those who share their gift of writing with the world. This is certainly not the first book I've read depicting the WWII era yet something about this story changed me; I do think that is what a good book does, it changes how you think,act, or feel.<br/>The Book Thief brings you inside war ravaged Germany and let's the reader experience life during that time in a very unique way. I highly recommend this book to young and old readers alike.
 This (along with The Orphan Master's Son)  is one of the best novels I have read in a long time.  It keeps to the  story so well.  Yes, they are all living in the time of the Nazis,  but this is more a story of realistic characters who are not embroiled in abstract, political spheres, but in the business of living (and some dying) in a very real world.<br/>It is the kind of book that I looked forward to get home to read every night.  Definitely a very good read and feel.<br/><br/>(They are allegedly making a movie out of it.  But I do not see how the language and environment of this novel can ever be translated to a film.  Stick to the book!)
 Oh my goodness!  Where have I been that I didn't know about this wonderful book?  I was hooked from the beginning by Death, the narrator.  I grew to love the characters and took a long time reading, just to savor the fabulous words.  Thank you, Markus Zusak!
 Highly recommend this book - I read it before seeing the movie and while the movie was very well done, the book has so much more to offer in the way it is written and in the detail of life experiences during this dramatic life and death event.  Offers a perspective on the daily challenges of the German people whether they liked or disliked what was happening and how they dealt with it.  Because it is what I consider "poetically written" it challenges the reader to think outside the box.  Good historical content.
 I could not put this book down. Period. I purchased it at 8am on a Friday and when I looked up at the clock, starving and tired eyes it was 8 pm. The last 30 pages of this novel touch your soul on a level that no other book ever has. It took me a week to write this review just because I wanted to see how long the characters stuck with me. Liesel Meminger, Hans Hubermann, Max, Rudy, you know their fates, Death tells you up front, he hates mystery, but it still does little to lessen the blow at the end. Markus even makes you care about Michael, the son of Rosa's Hubermann's rival, who only makes an appearance for perhaps 30 pages but the way he weaves him in and fleshes him out elevates him from the level of a simple placeholder to "my Lord, I love this character."<br/><br/>There is no way you can walk away from this book unchanged. It will stick with you forever. I bought it because the movie looked interesting, now I refuse to see the movie because I dare not let them ruin this wonderful piece of literary art that some day will join the likes of Steinbeck, Verne, and other classic novelists on the bookshelves of timeless works. Buy this book. You certainly will NOT regret it. That is my promise to you.
 This is a great story set during WW II.  The emotional story runs deeper than the story of the books but the parallel really works.  I could feel her delight in the books as there was not much joy during this time.  I also loved the way that her adopted family learned to enfold her into their family. The friendships she made were with very different people but she managed to settle into them completely.  I haven't seen the movie, but I highly recommend the book.
 I have read many accounts of the atrocities committed by the Nazi Party during WWII but this particular one will haunt me for a long time to come.  Not only was it a well written story full of human strength and frailty but when one considers how death is portrayed in a manner inconsistent with common folklore you must admit that it makes for an alluring read.  The character development was superb leaving the reader with the sense of recognition and kinship for all of the main characters.  "The Book Thief" will most defiantly be revisited as some later date.
 I will never forget this book. I have read many in my life and I can't say that about a lot of them...most of them. The writer penned this tale of love, hate,loss and death in a way that kept you gripped to a well known part of history. A part of history I didn't think needed retelling. How wrong I was. The Book Thief tells the horror that was Hitler's Germany in the life of real people and for he first time, I REALLY understood. Death as the narrator was brilliant. I hope my Angel of death is just like this one. I also hope the movie does this book justice.
 Love this book. Was crying in the end like a baby. It is amazing how people went through the WWII and did not lose themselves. Highly recommended to everyone who is ready to abandon his faith in humanity
 A book narrated by death sounds like it must surely be dark and ugly. Instead, it is somehow hopeful. It is certainly a dark and ugly time, with horrors surrounding the characters you come to love, but there is hope and love. This book has stayed with me, a year now since I read it. I vividly remember bawling my eyes out. I didn't just cry. I did the ugly cry. And yet, it's beautiful. A must read.
 When you pick up this book, you won't be able to put it down.  I laughed and I cried throughout the pages of Leisel Meminger's life as narrated by death.  The words are so poetic and assembled so gracefully that you become engaged and attached to the character narration of Death.<br/><br/>With every sentence, every paragraph, I eagerly anticipated what would happen next and I was never disappointed.  The point of view was unexpected and thoughtfully drawn out so as to give the reader insight into the lives of the Germans who lived their lives, struggling for their own sanity and safety while their homeland was despised as a result of their fuhrers maniacle leadership.<br/><br/>This is a well written, thought provoking book and will appeal to many readers."
 Just finished reading this book... Words, as powerful as they are, can not explain how beautiful this book is.<br/>The Book Thief is a young girl, adopted by foster parents in the poor area in Germany, who learns to trust, live, love, and survive. The first book she stole was a Gravedigger's book, found in the snow in a cemetery where her little brother was buried. From then on, she tries learning to read, and eventually, with help from her papa, masters the art of reading and understands the manipulating and wonderful power of words. She makes best friends along the way that help her grow. The story speeds up when they let a Jew hide in their basement, and the rest, you must read for yourself.<br/>This book is smartly executed, too, with Death as the narrator. Death has a weird, dry, and entertaining type of humor, that's great with teen or young adult readers. Zusak introduces the thought-provoking possibility that Death may be just as afraid of us as we are afraid of death. That maybe this fear should not be directed at Death, but at the many circumstances and sequence of events that lead to death. The way the story is narrated is a little hard to understand at first, but worry not, because you'll get accustomed to it, and the story speeds up fairly quickly. This book is also very emotional... left me in a mess of snot and tears. I feel that it has changed the way I see things with its symbolism and artful execution.<br/>This book is a must read, and will definitely leave you asking questions that usually do not have solid, black and white answers.
 Wow, where to begin?  This story was truly heart breaking and yet insightful.  It was interesting to see the war in Germany through a young German girl`s perspective.  I also like the unique narration given by death.<br/><br/>This story had it all!  Love, death, war as well as hero's and villains.  It also demonstrated the different ways people expressed love.  Most of all, it showed us how people could survive even under the worse of circumstances.<br/><br/>A book that will truly pull at your heartstrings!
 I read the book before I saw the move.  I loved the grime reaper as the narrator.  This book shed a new light on the life and times before and during WWII in Germany.  I was unaware of the issues with communists and how they were ostracized.  Each character with his or her struggles became real.  There are some very touching moments that made me cry.  I stayed up late to read the last 100 pages because I just couldn't put it down.  I would recommend this book to anyone 10ish to 101.
 I've started to get a little bored of books set in Germany about World War II. Yes, I know that it was a huge event that affected day-to-day life, but I was looking for something different. When my friend recommended The Book Thief to me, she said I would like it because it's different, and she was right.<br/><br/>Narrated by Death, this book is uniquely told from the beginning. Markus Zusak writes with a distinctly different voice, choosing beautiful turns of phrase that I couldn't bookmark fast enough. He was able to paint vivid scenes full of suspense and emotion that stayed with me well after I turned my Kindle off.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say it's terribly complex writing, but it's not exactly pick-up-and-scan material either; I found it easy to knock out chapters while commuting on the bus to and from work, but it certainly isn't something you read for the sake of reading. While I can't compare this to a similar book, I can say this: If you're sick of WWII tales, you'll be pleasantly surprised by The Book Thief.
 I just bought this book as a gift.  I read it a couple of years ago. Saw the movie too, but the book is better.
 When i first started reading this book i did not like it at all but I decided to stick with it. The writing format was so different and unusual that I was bothered by it a lot. For some reason I just didn't put it down and then slowly I got sucked into the subject matter and the characters. By the end I was crying and didn't want it to end. I immediately went out and rented the movie and was not disappointed in it even though in the book there was so much more details and history. It's just a beautiful story about love, war and the innocence of youth.
 I really enjoyed reading The Book Thief.  My only problem was that I kept comparing the book to the movie.  Usually I read the book first.  This novel was an interesting concept written from the German point of view rather than the American view of Germany during World War II.  Leisel was a very smart girl who won the hearts of her adoptive parents, even though the mother was a rather cold person but loved Leisel deep down in her heart.  The characters were well developed.  The book kept my interest throughout, and I'd recommend to anyone who wants a good book.  I couldn't figure out whose point of view the story was written but figured it out later.
 An amazing story set against one of the most horrific periods of human history. The choice for the narrator was the perfect symbol for this book.<br/>The story of WWII told from the perspective of one young girl on one poor street in one small town in Germany.
 I didn't expect this book to be so gripping.  The characters were extremely well developed.  Some were spellbinding.  I see why it was a Great American Read.
 This was a unique approach to an often-covered subject that needs even more creative ways to tell how innocent Germans, innocent Jews were affected by the Nazi regime.<br/>What a wonderful piece of storytelling!<br/>And how wise Death could be with his observations of human nature.<br/>The relationships between Rudy and The Book Thief and The Book Thief and her foster father and The Book Thief and Max were very touching and showed us even in a world of hate, humans forms islands of love and loyalty and those islands are worth paying the ultimate price.<br/>I'd recommend this book to anyone old enough to deal with complex issues of separation, death and grief - the world of Nazi Germany.
 Great book. I would recommend it for late teens and adults.  It moved my heart to think how good we have it here in the USA (for now).  You will enjoy it for sure. It's not a slow moving novel and you won't want to put it down.  God bless you.
 This book was full of very poetic descriptions and narration. The story was heartbreaking, but it was also peppered with a good does of fun mischief and unique friendships. Of course, anything set during the Holocaust is expected to be tragic, but this tale felt more whimsical being told from Death's point of view. I really adored it, all the way around, even though I would have preferred a somewhat happier ending. I'll definitely be rereading this one, and I'm looking forward to the movie!
 Markus Zusak has written a classic about what it was like for ordinary Germans who lived under the rise of Naziism starting in 1939 and who hated it. Zusak traces the innocence, bravery and awakening of pre-teen girl, Liesel, who loses her family and is thrust into a foster family. As Nazis burn books, Liesel, sparked by the allure and importance of words, sets out to steal books. The author weaves Liesel's quest to absorb words with the realization of the power of Hitler's words as he mesmerizes Germany. The narrator is Death, the all-too-active participant in the war. A reader wonders, at first, if the book will be too depressing. Stay the course. You will be moved, uplifted and will gain great understanding.
 This book made me cry any number of times and it is touching in an unforgettable way.  I will keep and treasure it. There is a scary political message here and something to be learned about how politics can spiral out of control and lose touch with morality.
 The brutality and monstrosities of the war created by the evil of Hitler et.al. Is brought to reality by this well told story.  One cannot help but be touched deeply by the characters so vividly brought to life by this author.  The choice of narration as the vehicle for the story and the brilliance of the choice of narrator is outstanding.  The telling of the tale by a seemingly impartial voice gives greater depth to the emotions elicited.  That the teller was touched by the telling draws the reader in all the more.
 Beautifully written WWII story told from the perspective of Death, a character. You won't find another story teller like Markus. Sheds a fun light on what those times were like as Death narrates the happenings of a young girl Leisel. Very engaging to begin with, but towards the end becomes a bit repetitive in the sense that character and plot development linger for a while. The themes make you think of the Nazi regime and how divided Germany really was. I'll let you read it to figure out what I mean by that (; Happy reading!!
 I can't remember the last time a book has had as much of an emotional impact on me as this one. I actually cried as I read it--and I don't know if I've ever cried over a book before. I also sped through the whole thing--over 500 pages--in less than 24 hours. I had to keep shooing away my husband and kids so I could finish reading it. The writing is luminous, the characters are unforgettable and have great depth, and the themes are as important as themes can get. The narrator, Death, is often sly and sarcastic, sometimes bitter, but never mean.<br/><br/>This book may be marketed at the "young adult" market, but "old adults" will like it just as much.
 This book was written in a different style, but I loved it and couldn't wait for the movie, which I did finally see.  She wasn't a thief in the usual way we think of a thief - she picked up books that were left behind or that were being burned or borrowed them and took them back.  This was the time of the German occupation and tells how it affects daily family life.  I helps us see how fortunate we are.<br/>I always love to read the book first, then see the movie, if possible.
 The "soul collector" who narrates this poignant tale tries to give an objective viewpoint; however, he becomes fascinated with the strength and determination of Liesel Meminger, our heroine and proud thief. Liesel is a German girl caught up unwillingly in Hitler's war against the world. She tries to make sense of a world that no longer makes sense, finding comfort in books and words. The book is haunting, filled with thoughtful characters who bring life to the book. As our narrator says, "I am haunted by humans."
 I am almost finished with this book and I'm sad it's coming to an end.  It is amazingly, cleverly written.  I like that its narrator is Death.  Death has a particular perspective that is very interesting.  It's a great book.  Highly recommend it!!!
 If I were to steal a book (which fortunately I have e-books) this one would be high on my list. The author brought back memories of Gunther Grass and his wonderful stories. I especially liked having a story told from the perspective of the Germans. Their suffering has not been so vividly portrayed in any other book I have read.  Especially,the small town life of every day working people who both look to Hitler as their salvation and a hated dictator of their lives. The narrative was fascinating. I did think the ending was a little too "happily ever after" but I truly loved all the characters. I especially liked the black uniformed man who inspected the basement. Not all Nazis where sub human.
 The author and the book are unique and very interesting.  At first I thought the choice of narrator was a little a strange, but I ended up liking the narrator very much.  The characters are so well developed and memorable, that I could visualize them.  This story reminds us or perhaps teaches some of us for the very first time that the German people suffered as well during WWII.  After a certain point, I could not put this book down and had to read it to the end.  It is a quick and entertaining read.
 Yes, it’s too long (about a hundred pages so). Yes, its language can be overly self-conscious. And yes, its attempt to humanize those who cheered on the Nazi war machine was a bit hard to take. But at the same time, it is breathtakingly beautiful, and its central characters, the book thief herself and her adoptive father, are among the greatest duo I’ve ever encountered in YA.
 Although I found this book a little hard to start once I did get into it, I was hooked. This story about a girl living as a foster child  in Nazi Germany was moving and indeed, thought provoking. Leisel looked at life uniquely and shared her details. You felt like you knew her friends and parents, neighbors, and boarders personally. You suffered, worried, appreciated, and loved with her. She shared her life with you. I wanted more and couldn't stop thinking about the book.
 The novel The Book Thief, by Markus Zusak, fits into the historical fiction genre.  However it can also fit into the adventure or suspense genres as well. This book is mainly for people in high school or older and a good understanding of World War II is almost a necessity.  There are various tones in this novel because of the narrator's feelings and the protagonists feeling are constantly changing.  The story is narrated by Death and the story is told from his point of view. Some of the characters in this story include the main character Leisel, the Hubermann family who are her adopting parents and her friends Max and Rudy, and of course Death.  Overall I give this book a 9/10.  I loved how this book gave me a whole new perspective on the lives of Jewish and German families during WWII.  Zusak's theme of hop and life are clearly expressed throughout the novel and I feel like it was greatly written.  I love how the author connected the novel to many events that actually happened and made the characters part of those events.  I think that the author did an amazing job with this novel and I can't wait to see if the 2014 movie can match or even top this books greatness.  If there was one this I could change it would to be for Rudy to survive.  His death was probably one of the most depressing parts of this novel but it still was a great addition.  I would greatly recommend this book to all my friends and family and it is by far one of my favorite books that I have read.<br/><br/>-Jake Estares
 I've never read a book that I was jealous of the brilliance of the narration until now..<br/> i can't number how many times I stopped and re-read sentences and just stared in awe....absolutely brilliant book!<br/>The ability to connect me with this story and characters blew me away, then multiple times through out to be almost caught off guard when reminded that it's narrated by death....<br/>Sat and stared at the last sentence for quite some time, just soaking in the entire experience..... amazing book!
 This story is told from a unique and interesting perspective. The characters are engaging and you are transported into their world at this time in history. Many stories of this horrendous time are told from the side of the persecuted and it is interesting to see one told from the view of the regular people of a small German town who were thrown into this "mess" with not many options.  I am glad that I read the book in addition to seeing the movie. As expected, the book gives you so much more.
 I don't read much; therefore, I don't write very many book reviews. I started reading this book because a friend spoke very highly of it and their description of it caught my interest. I am so very glad I did. I fell in love with each of the characters and found myself really caring for each of them. The relationships Liesel Meminger has with Rudy, Hans, Rosa, Max, and Ilsa Hermann are so beautiful that you almost feel like you are right there with each of them as the story is unfolding. This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. And now I think Saumensch and Saukerl are now two of my favorite words. ;-)
 I had no pre-conceived notion when I purchased this book and I am glad I didn't.  I loved the storyline and the characters. The story is told from the point of view of "Death" who traces the life of a young German girl, a small German town during WWII, and its people.<br/>I won't say too much, but encourage everyone who is looking to escape and read war from a very different angle to give "The Book Thief " a try. It is refreshing, charming and an great insight into human nature, without being judgemental.
 My 14 year old daughter read this before I did. Then my mother. Both generations said it was in their top 5 books they've ever read. I was scared to read it because I don't like sad books--I usually read to distract, not to provoke thought and to cry. Over and over I got told by many people how good this book was and that I should read it. And now I agree. My daughter said I would probably cry but that it would be "a good cry."  She was right.  So sad, so well written and so moving. A good cry.
 First, let new say that this is not a book that I would typically read, but for some reason I was drawn to it. I am so thankful something told me to read The Book Thief.<br/><br/>The story truly does take you back in Liesel's life, to an era that wasn't nearly as accepting as we are blessed with today. This story brings out every possible emotion you could think of, most certainly tears.<br/><br/>This is one of those books that will stay with you a lifetime, no matter your desired genre, you will enjoy this book.
 One of the most amazing books I have read.  It held my interest from page one until the last page.  I love that  the author told the story through the eyes of death.  I felt such compassion for death, the author described death so clearly that I could see him clearly as I saw the other people in the story.  I have not read any of Mr. Zusak's  works but look ward to reading more of his works in the future. I think he is a wonder storyteller and I like his style of writing.  I am so glad to have experienced a wonderful well written book.
 An amazingly well-written book.  The story centers around the holocaust but the author kept it from being too gruesome and morbid. It was both tragic and heartwarming at the same time.  The author's choice of narrator was brilliant!  I predict this book will become a classic, maybe it already has!  After reading the book I saw the movie version which was well done but abbreviated a great deal.  Many more events and feelings in the book rather than the movie.  A must read!
 I agree with all the reviews that stress the brilliance of this book, not least its emphasis on the power of words to create, shape, and destroy.  It is not some abstract musing, though, but a totally compelling story with vivid characters, encompassing the whole spectrum of human emotions, including humor, and shedding a rarely-seen light on this side of Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>Just because the main protagonist is a child, however, I think it is a mistake to market it as young adult literature, which it is not.  Young adults will take a lot away from this book, certainly, but it is nevertheless sophisticated adult literature (and no, that doesn't mean it has sex scenes).
 I wholeheartedly believe that every book review should have a comparison to some trendy reality show, movie, etc. However this book is so special it truly supersedes anything current in society today. I know this novel is labeled as Young Adult but the story is so moving and so powerful that it is something everyone should read. WWII is heart wrenching in and of itself but this story brings forth emotions from your core. The unique angle of telling this story from the perspective of Death (this is not a spoiler as you will find this out within the first couple pages or quite frankly from the synopsis, reviews, basically everywhere so I am not giving away anything) is really inspiring. It made me think about humanity and I just sat there thinking about what I read once I finished the book. I read reviews that stated they didn't like the way the book was written and that it made no sense how the author made up words. But let's be honest here we don't read fiction in order to become smarter, we read them to become lost in a story and that is what this book does.
 I believe this book is recommended high school reading, but as a 36 year old "mature" reader I thoroughly enjoyed it. The history of Nazi Germany has always fascinated me - how an entire country could let itself spiral into the depths of such depravity. But it is the story and prose of this book that truly steal the show. Told from the perspective of the "grim reaper" it is one of the most unique narrators I have read. Given the content you would think the book would be incredibly depressing, however it is filled with light and inspiration that comes from our ability to love. A definite must read.
 Overall this was a good read. There were some confusing parts with all of the German terms and at times it was hard to follow. It took me a while to read this book because of the complicity of it, I wasn't always  sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to return to find out what happens next. I did enjoy the story of the little girl and all of her struggles, I would have enjoyed a little more information about her life after the bombings. I would recommend this book to more experienced readers.
 A most excellent book with very good story to tell. It portrays a decent German family during the WWII time period with an adopted orphan who learns to read from Papa. They are so poor she needs to steal books from the rich mayor's wife, who eventually falls in love with her and gives her books. Great book with surprising ending! The movie based on this was also excellent but not 100% true to the book. .
 This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Me and my daughter absolutely love this movie. The book is pretty great as well.
 Wonderful and powerful story. I am using this as a supplementary text in my 9th grade classroom and it has been received very well.<br/><br/>The book itself (from Amazon) includes extra anecdotes and was in good shape (one would hope because, you know, it’s new...) Solid purchase.
 I loved the book!  I couldn't put it down.<br/>I thought it was well written, a bit depressing but it was the horrors of war after all.  I was fascinated by the fact that the story was told from the perspective of "death".  The characters were well developed, realistic, and lovable.  The author did an amazing job of making the horrific events of WWII  in Nazi Germany into a heart warming story of those who lived it most intimately, in this case the people in this tiny German village.  The ending was very surprising.  I didn't see a happy ending coming, if one can call it that after all the suffering the main character endured.  It's a must read for all historical fiction fans.  This book would make a great book club read.
 Cannot put into words how this book has changed me. The writing was simply beautiful and the characters made my heart ache. This book blew me away and has not left my mind even after finishing its last words. This will be a book I constantly revisit to remind myself just how good life is, and just how hard others have had it, and how important it is to expose our hearts and minds to stories such as Liesel's. I will never be the same after reading The Book Thief....and I am glad for that.
 This is an unusual book. The sentence structure, the frequent bold print announcements, and the copious German language profanity were quite unexpected. The early chapters were a bit slow, and the perspective was so strange that it took me a while to get used to it. This novel did not hold my attention unfailingly, but in the end I was glad that I read the whole thing. It is a wonderful and worthwhile story.<br/><br/>I became fond of Liesel, papa and Rudy. They are fully believable, fully human characters. The author writes that they were the first characters he actually missed when the writing was done. I certainly miss them since I finished the story. Their love for each other was a wonderful thing to experience. The feelings between Liesel and Max were especially poignant. Zusak describes them in a realistic and heart wrenching way.<br/><br/>The choice of death as the narrator gave the book a unique flavor. While sergeant death is actually quite morbid at times, he or she is a sympathetic and understanding observer of human nature. In the early chapters I found this narrator to be a little too judgmental. I thought that some characters were typecast before I had a chance to know them. However, as the book progresses, these characters are revealed in more complex and  realistic fashion. Zusak is a capable writer.
 Such an amazing story.  This author enthralled me with such imagery through his words and approach that I could not put down The Book Thief.  Truly a heartbreaking but beautiful story told through the visions of an unusual narrator.  Characters are so well developed, you come to know and admire or feel their emotions... almost like being there in that moment.  So well written with a perspective not normally considered that anyone capable of reading will agree, it will be one of this century's best books.
 I was initially unnerved by having Death be the narrator, but in the end, it worked perfectly. This story surprised in other ways too. It brought the tension between German citizens and Nazi powers into clear view through the story of every day people. Sad, inspiring, brutal, and real are a few adjectives I'd give to describe this story.
 After a bit of a slow start, I really got into this book. It is the story of a few years in the often bleak life of a young girl in Nazi-era Germany. Not quite Anne Frank but well-written and the characters are mostly sympathetic, even the narrator. For the most part, I liked the choices the author made with the narration, with the exception of a little too much spoiling (you'll just have to see what I mean). I also would have liked a bit more detail at the end of the story. It looks like the movie version was quite different from the book, so don't judge one based on the other.
 Every once in a while you come across a book that leaves an impression on you for life.  The Book Thief is deffinately one of those stories that stays with you long after it ends. Excellent.
 One of the most beautiful books I've read in forever. Though the subject matter is dark, it's infused with the sweet reminder of simple pleasures (like reading a book) and of sacrificial friendship. I loved the characters and that death narrated the book with such aching poignancy. Steel yourself for the read, but for heaven's sake, read it. It will make a lasting impression, if not the story, then the beautiful writing and prose.
 Have you ever read a book that you enjoyed so much that you slowed the pace to savor it for as long as yo can? I have read a few, and this is one of them. It touches your soul.... It is a wonderful story.
 Despite people saying the movie being just as good as the book, I liked the book better. It's filled with so much more emotion and takes its time letting the characters experience them. Background stories and thought processes are always missed, and emotions are always rushed when they have to fit in a 2 hour movie. The best part is the narrator in this book - death, who becomes such a tangible, likable part of the story.
 My book group chose this as our November selection -- even though we are between the ages of 46 - 55 and this is classified as YA.  It was wonderful !!<br/><br/>This book follows Leisel Meminger from the age of 10 to 14 or so with an epilogue after her death.  She is a young German girl living in a small town outside of Munich during the days of Hitler/Nazi Party/World War II.  Her story is narrated by Death who talks about her life as well as those people closest to her such as her foster parents and neighbors.  The level of detail in the writing brings her story alive and is told in such a creative fashion that I'm sure I won't forget it for a long, long time and I will probably re-read again in the future.<br/><br/>My father served in WW2 in Europe and was wounded in France by the Germans.  I have always viewed that time in history through an American lense.  This book really opened my eyes to what it must have been like for the German civilians caught up in the tyranny of the Third Reich and all the horrors of Hitler.  I had never really considered the event from their point of view and I am so glad I was given the opportunity.<br/><br/>I would categorize this book as YA (not younger than high school) or adult fiction due to two things:<br/><br/>1)  the novel is pretty graphic in places regarding war injuries as well as the horror the Jews suffered.<br/><br/>2)  the narration can be jarring as it goes between Death and the "people" in the book.  While a 7th or 8th grade student would probably be fine with the vocabulary and the style, there would need to be a real effort put forward on their part.  I think it might feel more like a classroom literature assignment for that age group where, by waiting a year or two, they could truly enjoy it.<br/><br/>A truly great book and highly recommended !
 This book is beautifully written, poignant, and thoughtful.  I even reread many passages because the language was so beautiful.  Writing the story from the viewpoint of Death as a character was brilliant....gives death a new personality instead of how we usually stereotype it/him/her.  The story is good, but the writing is absolutely wonderful!!  I'm afraid the movie cannot come close to the book itself.  Read the book, then see the movie if you must, but you will miss a great experience if you don't read the book!
 WOW!!  I had to read this for school, and it is now my favorite book!  I love it soooo much!!!!  From page one i was hooked by the majestic and curious writing of Markus Zusak.  The narration caught me and i could soon not put the book down.  A beautiful story of a young girl who found inspiration and happiness in writing and reading.  I can relate to Liesel in that way.  I will not lie, i cried a few times.  I could imagine myself with Liesel when she finds her family and friends at the end (haha, i don't want to give away anything...).  I could feel for her.  If you are looking for a marvelous but intense book, The Book Thief is the book for you.<br/><br/>PS<br/>you will cry
 "The Book Thief " is one of the best novels I have read. Truly! Author Markus Zusak's storyline is both sad and wonderful, as it deals with Germany during WWII and the Holocaust. His memorable characters have tremendous depth, and the plot is extremely original. However, what makes this book so extraordinary is the author's writing, which, at times, is more poetry than prose. I frequently found myself reading passages of the elegantly written narrative aloud.<br/><br/>Appropriately for the times, Death is our narrator and a major character. Death, the "gatherer of souls," writes of himself, "I do not carry a sickle or scythe. I only wear a hooded black robe when it's cold. And I don't have those skull-like facial features you seem to enjoy pinning on me from a distance. You want to know what I really look like? I'll help you out. Find yourself a mirror while I continue." In the Prologue, Death states, "Here is a small fact: you are going to die. Does that worry you? I urge you - don't be afraid. I'm nothing if not fair." The figure describes himself as amiable, even affable, but warns, "don't ask me to be nice. 'Nice' has nothing to do with me.'"<br/><br/>When the novel begins, Death is gearing up for mass production. It is 1939 and WWII has just begun. By 1945 the entire world will be at war. And it is Death who comments on man's inhumanity to mad, almost without emotion, in as objective a manner as possible. This inhumanity will cause it/him to work 24/7 in various places in the world at once. That's what I call multi-tasking.<br/><br/>Nine year-old Liesel Meminger is our protagonist, "the book thief," although when we meet her, she is unschooled and cannot read very well. Liesel, her little brother Werner, and their mother are on a train to Munich. All three are skinny and pale, with sores on their lips. It is on the train that Death comes to claim young Werner's soul. Liesel and her mother despair. The boy is buried near the city, and one of the gravediggers, an apprentice, drops a black book as he walks away in the freezing winter weather. Liesel picks up the book, without calling out to notify the gravedigger of his loss. The book is titled, in silver letters, "The Gravedigger's Handbook." It is the first book she steals. So much has been taken from her, the grieving child feels like she settles part of the score when she commits the theft. In Munich the girl's mother bids her good-bye and turns her over to a foster care woman. The mother disappears, never to be seen again.<br/><br/>Liesel and the woman make their way to a small town, Molching, on the outskirts of Munich, close to the Dachau death camp. They stop at a small house on Himmel Street, where her new foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, await the little girl. Hans is a kind and loving man who quickly takes to Liesel and visa versa. Rosa is also basically kind, although she puts up a front as a shrewish loudmouth. She is a laundress by trade and Hans is a house painter who loves to play the accordion. He is not a member of the Nazi Party. When he realizes he is losing customers because of his lack of enthusiasm for Hitler and the Nazis, he tries to join but his papers are on permanent hold. Their two children are grown and live away from home.<br/><br/>Liesel has terrible nightmares and occasionally wets the bed. Hans, hearing her late night screams, sits with her and comforts her, sometimes until dawn. Occasionally he plays the accordion for her until Rosa yells at him to "shut up!" The empathetic, kindly man and the traumatized little girl form a close bond and Hans begins to teach Liesel to read, especially as she is fascinated by words. She believes that words have great power, after all, Hitler didn't need guns to persuade the German people to follow him and to hate Jews. He used words.<br/><br/>When she begins school and the teacher realizes that the girl can't read, she is placed in a class with younger children. Most humiliating! It is during one of Liesel's frequent nightmares, that Hans begins to teach her to read. Since the Hubers have no books of their own, Hans uses Liesel's "The Gravedigger's Handbook." as a teaching tool. Then another book, a copy of "Mein Kampf," is acquired, one of the few available books which have not been burned. And yet another book, "The Shoulder Shrug." which Liesel snatches from a pile of burning books, is added to her collection. "Germans loved to burn things. Shops, synagogues, Reichstags, houses, personal items, books and of course, people."<br/><br/>Eventually, Liesel acclimates to her new home and makes friends, especially with Rudy, the boy next door and her biggest fan. She never overcomes her nightmares, however, nor does she ever forget her mother and brother. It is at this time when she is forced to join Hitler Youth.<br/><br/>Then Max Vandenberg, a German Jew in hiding, comes to ask Hans to fulfill a promise he made to his father, a comrade in arms who saved Hans' life during WWI. A Jew seeking refuge...what to do? Hans, an honorable man, feels obligated to keep his promise, even though it would mean death for Rosa and himself if Max were discovered in their home. Liesel is sworn to secrecy. The Hubers take the man in and set up living quarters for him in the basement. Max becomes part of the family and forms a close friendship with Liesel. She becomes his eyes and ears to the outside world. He eventually writes a book for her, "The Standover Man" - a simple, illustrated and haunting book about what it is like to be born Jewish in Hitler's Germany.<br/><br/>Life goes on. Liesel learns to read and steals more books - fourteen in all. She and her friends adventure. Germany declares war on Russia. Death's work increases, especially on the eastern front and in the concentration camps. He/it feels overwhelmed by the souls to collect from the camps, gas chambers, battlefields, and causalities from air-raid bombings. Max begins to do crossword puzzles in the old newspapers Liesel occasionally finds for him. Rosa's and Han's workload diminishes significantly. Times are tough, rationing is strict, and people don't have money to send out their laundry or to have their houses painted. And, of course, Hans carries the stigma of not belonging to the Party. I don't want to include any spoilers, so I will stop my summary here.<br/><br/>This is a powerful novel that kept me riveted throughout. As I wrote above, I sometimes stopped to read parts of the prose aloud. There is humor here also. One needs comic relief when reading a novel about such a heinous period in mankind's history.<br/><br/>Markus Zusak's  parents grew up in Nazi Germany and Austria. He frequently thought of writing about the things his parents had seen during the war. He says he thought about the "importance of words in that time, and what they were able to make people believe and do."<br/><br/>The novel's last words belong to Death: "A LAST NOTE FROM YOUR NARRATOR: I am haunted by humans."<br/>Jana Perskie
 A simple story of complex dimension... Very Well Told! A ‘must read,’ especially for anyone under 50 years of age as a preventative for future war and tyranny! Goodness comes in all shapes and sizes! Loved the book.
 I've read many Holocaust books, but this one takes a different, very personal perspective and feels unique. It's an incredibly fast read and an extremely touching plot. The main character is a non-Jewish child trying to make sense of all the horrors she witnesses. There is a sense of impending doom throughout the whole book. You care deeply about Leisel's father and mother, and Max the boxer. It's hard to tell where disaster will come from or to know if you should keep hope alive as you read. When you finish it, you truly feel like you were transported into another life for a little while.
 This was a book that a book cub member picked out for all of us to read or I am sure that I would have put it down  Call me "chicken" if you will, but even I know these facts to be true, I guess one just doesn't like reading ab out it. It is certainly not light reading and I almost could not read it at bedtime,  but I am quite sure that it was a dose of old medicine not wasted  If Markus Zusak writes about darkness all the time, I probab ly would not choose to read him again. Now people may think me air headed and wimpy but when you get to be 78 yrs. life can be hard what with your ailments and loved ones dying around you. People, that just PLAIN HURTS!  But I don't  think I would care to write ab out that or necessarily read about it. For me, it is just best to pray to my God to get me through  and  know that there will be better days. I realize that everyone doesn't feel that way and that is o.k. with me. Each of us have to find our own b est path through life.
 The book is unique because of Zuzak's utterly rampant unconventional use of words in his prose.  It is thoroughly refreshing to experience words used in a way that you could never imagine such as "stumbling shoes" but such phrases evoke exactly the mental image that the author wants to convey giving inanimate objects a personality while reflecting the state of their human hosts perfectly.
 Had a hard time getting into it at first.  Didn't care for "death" being the narrator was a bit confusing.  Almost stopped reading it several times but happy I didn't give up.  After a couple chapters, it pulled me in and never let go.  In the past, I've always (sad to say) just thought of the German's during the war as "bad" but this story made me realize that many of them too did not go along with Hitler's ideas.  Love a book that brings out emotions and this one surely did.  Highly recommended if you don't mind holding a hankie and can stick with for several chapters  it until it grabs you.
 I liked how the narrator told the story from a neutral position.  It was a very different angle.  I never really thought about the german people who were NOT brainwashed, but afraid. The people who did not support Hitler but were too afraid for their own lives to stand up against him. This gave me a different perspective to the pain those people endured, feeling helpless against the brutality. The story sucked me in immediately and I couldn't put the book down.
 War is the real thieving villain of the human condition.  It takes wealth, health and eventually it destroys a person's spirit.  There are a few who won't allow this total destruction,  and the book thief is one of them.<br/><br/> Her life is a string of horrors punctuated by moments of love and pure joy.  When all is lost and life just cannot continue,  she fools us all.<br/><br/>If you have a heartbeat, prepare to have it stopped by the last couple of chapters.  (no skipping ahead now)  This is a must read, that is if you haven't seen the movie yet.  Books like this one keep our libraries humming.  Ah the majesty of the printed word.<br/><br/>John Harlow, Cannon Falls, Minnesota
 I absolutely love this book.  It is my go-to recommendation when people ask for one.  The writing is beautiful, and the narrator is very unique and different from other things I have read.  I really like the different aspect of the book, being set in Nazi Germany but not following soldiers  or at a concentration camp.  It reminds us that there was more going on than just those things.  A thought provoking and wonderful book.
 The Book Thief is my new favorite book. I love the concept and the way it was written. Even though I saw the movie before reading the book, the ending still makes me cry.  I love the humor, the poignancy, and just the care with which Markus Zusak took to write this book.  This book truley made me fall in love with books and reading and writing all over again.<br/><br/>And i want to write like Markus Zusak when I grow up:)
 Written beautifully and uniquely, this is a captivating book that tells a WWII story from a new angle. Even though the author foreshadows events throughout the story, reading the actual passages where these things happen is still deeply moving — this surprised me and drew me even further in to the world of this book. For me, it took a few pages of understanding the narrator and writing style to get into it, but once you're in you're in deep :) I highly recommend it.
 This is a lesson about human beings. It's about love and it's about a young girl having her heart torn apart over and over again. I've long believed that the German bystanders were heartless while watching their fellow German neighbors being marched to the death camps. But history tells us many, like Liesel and the Hubermans, Liesel's adoptive parents, saw the injustices and risked their lives to save Jews, Because her mother and brother were taken from her, so did she try to "get even" by stealing books. Reading was Liesel's lifeline ; forming a bond with Papa; and with the neighbor to whom she read books. While "seeing " Leisel desperately search through the wretched stumbling bodies of Jews, for Max the man her family hid; my heart ached &amp; cried as the two grasped for a touch. This story which I found to be so moving made me feel as if I was right on Himmel St. in Molching, along with Liesel and her good friend Rudy. How tragic for young lives having to experience and witness  such evil and torture.<br/>Marcus Zusak is a master story teller,using poetic style to show the mix of  death with evil and love.
 The Book Thief is a WWII story about a girl who is ripped from her family and placed in a small German town where she begins to form meaningful and often quirky relationships with her new adopted family, friends and neighbors. Yes, the main character (Liesel) steals books, but only ones that have been left for the taking. Once the characters of the small town are set in place, the author brings in Max, the Jewish boy who hides in the basement of Liesel's house. Max brings new purpose to the family who hides him. And although the reader never gets to fully know Max, his presence allows the other characters to grow exponentially. Beautiful relationships are formed within the Nazi horrors of the small town. The author does a tremendous job in showing the power words have in both destroying and building relationships.
 This is one of my favorite books read in recent months.  Zusak writes in a way that you can visualize and feel just what the character is experiencing.  I fell in love with so many of the characters as the story evolved. Some I initially despised, I grew to love and appreciate just like people we know. A harsh nature is replaced by understanding the need to express in that way, knowing that beneath the surface lies a loving mother. A girl trying to understand why she's compelled to be a thief, a jibing yet loyal friendship between friends and a dad who knows how to comfort and appease mother and child as necessary.  There are so many characters with shared loyalties during this difficult time that the author wonderfully develops throughout the story.  It's a must read.
 Have seen this book for a couple of years but my book club chose it recently. I reluctantly began reading it and quickly drawn in to the characters and story. We all agreed that the style of writing, character development and historical aspects were what makes it such a good choice for any book club.
 I had concluded reading The Book Thief before I noted that it is listed as "young adult" literature.  But it did not change my feelings for this story, very clever and original.  It is not always pretty and dreadfully sad,, but the characters were so real, I found myself talking to them. The history and facts are real, the  book people and their personal  struggles to exist  are fiction.  A  touching and dear story. A book that I would most likely re again.  Read it,
 An exceptional story by an exceptional author. Tuck yourself in for this one because once you start, you won't want to put it down. The Book Thief has now become one of my all time favorite books.
 Markus Zusak uses his pen to make each of us a word stealer, a book thief. I think his words and his characters, including death, have pierced my soul. The colors of the feelings are sitting on me- silver eyes, lemon suns, gray clouds, brilliant white snow, black paint covering qindows, Rudy's painted black skin and his endlessly yellow hair...i have always wondered how I would have survived a life in Germany under Hitler. Now, the question has been answered. I would have been the same as many Germans- hurting so deeply for their neighbors, friends, and yet unable to give up on life. A continual strength in order to survive. How do humans have this will, need, to live, no matter how difficult life is? As Zusak's character, Death, i too would have to close by acknowledging, Humans haunt me. My God, is the only thing that gives me the strength to go on.
 What a fabulously touching, heartwarming, cheerful and deeply moving line up of characters and their story. As a committed lover of books, words and people, I couldn't put it down. Mr. Zusak has a masterful command of the English language. He also gently expanded my minuscule knowledge of my German ancestors' mother tongue. For those of us that are WWII story buffs, this incredible story came close to hundreds of others, not just in Germany, but in towns and villages all over war torn Europe. A superb must read!! Now, on to the movie!!
 This book touched my heart and soul. It is staged during WWII in Germany...a time that has always interested me. This book was different though. It includes many different people, but mostly it is about the poor German families caught up in this terrible time. We seldom think about how the war affected good German people. You see this period through the eyes of the "Grim Reaper", the narrator of "The Book Thief". I gave this a 5 because this is a book that will always stay with me and impacted me deeply. I highly recommend this book!
 This is the first story I've read that had me pulling for the Germans in WWII.  Certainly not pulling for the Nazis, but rather for the German people simply trying to survive.  As much misery as Adolf Hitler visited on the rest of Europe, and certainly the Jews, it's too easy to overlook the pain he caused his own people.  I suppose he's noteworthy in that he caused misery to almost the entire world.<br/><br/>Liesel's story is one of survival during horrible times, but also of the courage brought about by love.  Love is throughout:  Papa for Liesel, Liesel for Papa, Liesel for Max, Rudy and Liesel for each other -- and this love inspires fearlessness in the lover.
 I laughed and I cried.  I learned a tiny amount of history.<br/><br/>The only thing I would change is the very beginning, as the narrative introduces himself.  It is too weird.  It almost made me put the book down and determine it wasn't my style, but luckily the narrator begins focusing on the really interesting stories, and it becomes difficult to put the book down.<br/><br/>My suggestion is to not give up on the book based on the first couple chapters.  You will be forever changed by this book.
 I just could not get into the way it was written. Very slow.  I may try again since I know people that rave about it.
 Initially, I was turned off by the writing style of the book; the 'stage setting' introductions for each chapter put me off; however, once I got over that, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  This book lends a human perspective to the atrocities of WWII.  While the narrative is by given by Death himself, most of the novel is from the point of view of a group of German kids ranging in age from 11-14 - presenting what war and Hitler’s agenda looked like for them.  This is a very touching, and endearing read, which I highly recommend.
 A wonderfully crafted story of hope and life amid terrible circumstances. The author's ingenious use of an allegorical narrator, sensitive character development  and vivid descriptive language fueled this reader's interest through multiple plot twists and to an especially satisfying ending. Written from the perspective of fellow non-Jewish Germans during the Holocaust, The Book Thief illustrates the ravages of violence and war on all they touch.
 Interesting time when Nazis were rising and books were being burned.  The books that were stolen were only borrowed without permission.  Book is well written, but overly long for the material.
 This truly is a modern day classic. The Book Thief should become required reading for high school students. I loved the style in which it is written. I would highly recommend this book for junior high, high school students and adults of all ages
 Most of the movies and books about Germany before and during WWII depict the German people as apathetic, uncaring and a nation that closed its eyes to the horror going on. This book gave a different perspective on the everyday common German in a suburb of one of Germany's largest cities.  The portrayal of the book thief was sensitive and moving as was the portrayal of most of the main characters in the book.  I highly recommend it. It's one of those books that stays with you long after you've turned the last page.
 The Book Thief is an extremely well written book.  It was just what I expected:  a heart moving and emotional book.  I agree with another reviewer who said that it is not fast moving.  It is not.  But Zusak definitely does a great job at making you feel as if you were with the characters.  I am sure everyone will like The Book Thief for their own reasons, but one of my favorite things about the book is that it brought me back to childhood.  It does have a nice emotional ending as well, which is what I was hoping for.
 This book is the first one I read this year, and wow, it has really set the bar! I read 2-3 books a week, in a variety of genres, and this one absolutely captivated me with charm and warmth. I have read The Diary of Ann Frank, as a little girl, and more recently Night, when Oprah featured it for her book club, but The Book Thief is far and away the best book I have ever read about Nazi Germany. I felt such a love for the characters, and the author's style is totally enthralling. He writes with such a light touch, that even a subject as grim as the Holocaust, while not in any sense ever for a moment being trivialized, is so greatly humanized. Images of children playing soccer in the streets, unaware of the evil around them, or a little girl with secrets, and a young life that has known real horror, yet still finds beauty in the world around her... Wow, I could not put it down. Absolutely lovely, and one that I will be judging every other read this year against, and remember for a long, long time. I can't wait to read his next book, and have ordered it already.
 "The Book Thief" is narrated by Death, who has the advantage over the other characters of being able to be everywhere at once.  He can also play with the action, like the guy in the movie "Click."  This Death is not an anti-Semite, and has most of his sympathy for the good guys in the story, although being Death, you'd think he'd be neutral.  But wars create a lot of extra work, so he has mixed feelings about those, like Hitler, that start them.<br/><br/>(First note: The protagonist winds up living where the book jacket says the author does, which makes me worry that I am being harsh about a real-life based story.)<br/><br/>Death tells the story of the book thief, i.e. Liesel Meminger, a recently orphaned eleven-year-old, who is taken in by foster parents, when her own are persecuted for being Communists.  Her new family is earthy but have hearts of gold underneath, and show this by hiding a Jewish man in their basement for much of the book.<br/><br/>(Second side note: The author went to school in a very politically correct area and era, so she feels uncomfortable pointing out flaws in a book about the Holocaust.  The writing style can be awkward, and the action stalled about halfway through, focusing on less important characters.<br/><br/>Many of the characters have mixed (to say the least) feelings about the spread of Nazism and do their. best to help their Jewish neighbors.  Meanwhile Liesel collects books scavenged from book burnings and slowly comes to love reading and writing.<br/><br/>(Third side note - But she is going to post the review anyway because unlike Germans living under Nazi regime, Americans are allowed to voice their opinions, however unpopular.)<br/><br/>There are heroes in this book, but none are Mary Sues.  Victories come at a high price.  Despite the odd metaphors sprinkled throughout the story, I would recommend this book.<br/><br/>(Fourth side note: Although that also means that future reviewers are free to post their opinion by voting unhelpful because they consider the author politically incorrect or plain wrong.  But that's life.)
 This is one of the best books I've ever read. It has a very interesting outlook as it's written in the voice of "death." Writing it that way gave the author a different perspective and freedom to witness war events. It's extremely well written, realistic, sad, but is a very good story. I'd definitely recommend it. I thought it was deep and tough in spots and good for an older audience.
 Someone told me this book was written for youth.  Maybe they were mis-informed.  I read the book to preview it for my 12 year old grandson and ruled it out.  A well-written book but I thought a bit too graphic for a 12 year old.  The story follows the teen age years of a young orphan girl adopted by a German family that later hides a Jew in their basement.  The relationships among all family members the Jew and the girl's friends evolve beautifully and skillfully.  A very powerful book.
 Don't read this when you are feeling down because the description of life during the dark days of the Nazis will not cheer you up, especially when you realize so many of the characters do not have a future. On the other hand, the basic, underlying goodness in the hearts of nearly all the characters, and the idea that some light will survive the darkness, is inspiring, and refreshes one's faith in human nature. Among Nazi-era stories, that is a rare message.
 Markus Zusak, is certainly an author with a masterful use of the language.<br/>I loved his descriptive way of telling his story. The fact that the book is narrated gives one the feeling they are at a story telling.<br/>I did feel the impact of the story went through a lull after the beginning, which was probably because the story was being set up, but from halfway through it certainly picked up its momentum and holds the reader tightly in its pages.<br/><br/>A wonderfully told story with important messages to be understood.
 With a prodigious use of allegory, Marcus Zusak has written an enthralling human story of ordinary people caught in the trauma of  Second World War Germany.  In each of the captivating pages of The Book Thief,  an ethos and optimism arises from the hearts of children, momentarily displacing the horrors of the war.<br/><br/>Zusak chose Death, The Grim Reaper, as the narrator of his story. The protagonist is  a young girl, Liesel Meminger, handed off  by her mother to German  foster parents after Liesel's brother dies in her arms on the floor of an unheated rail car.  At her brother's  burial Liesel recovers the only memory available, an abandoned copy of The Grave Diggers Handbook. Thus The Book Thief  is born. This is a story of words, an accordionist, fanatical Germans, a Jewish fist fighter, thievery, friendships, love and family and above all a relationship between a daughter and step-father.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is a portrait of how war and the Holocaust causes ordinary people and families  to reshape their lives to survive.  Meet Liesel's step-father and mother Hans and Rosa Hubermann, her best friend and partner in book thievery Rudy and the Jew Max, hidden from  the Nazis for two years in the basement of the Hubermann home.  Zusak is such a marvelous story-teller that the journey is never predictable, even as death himself narrates the tale. The story is told so beautifully that the reader may consider clearing the time for the final 200 pages in one sitting.<br/><br/>A word from the Narrator: "I wanted to tell the book thief many things about beauty and brutality. But what could I tell her about those things that she didn't already know? I wanted to explain that I am constantly overestimating and underestimating the human race-that rarely do I simply estimate it. I wanted to ask her how the same thing could be so ugly and so glorious, and its words and stories so damning and brilliant."<br/><br/>I have not seen the motion picture but as stated many times before, a good rule of thumb is to always read the book first!<br/><br/>I highly recommend The Book Thief for readers of any age. Other books by  Markus Zusak are Fighting Ruben Wolfe, Getting the Girl and I Am the Messenger. Read more reviews at gordonsgoodreads.com<br/><br/>Enjoy!
 Very well written! I couldn't tear away from it after the first couple of chapters. The depth of the characters drew you in.
 Interesting story of the Nazis and the average German citizen during World War ii. Interesting because the story was told through the eyes of a young German girl, who witnesses the brutality of the Nazis, not only to the Jews, but to her own German friends, and family members, if they do not follow the Nazi Government orders under the rule of Adolph Hitler.
 This book was written in the most unique manner I have ever read.  It made reading the tough material a little easier.  It was a wonderful, insightful book from the other side and I had never read anything from that point of view.  I still can't imagine how the people let it happen-fear? complicity? genuine hate?  There were all kinds of people and all kinds of feelings that I had never explored before. I have been to Dauchau, and could picture the Jews walking down the street to be exterminates.  I have been in the "delousing" rooms and seen the ovens. How glad I was that Max lived!
 This is definitely one of those occasions where the Book is better than the movie.  If you truly want to follow the "BookThief" and her life, then you need to read this book, or read (yes read) the audiobook.  Marcus Zusak does a phenomenal job with this story.  You feel for the characters, want to know more, and miss them when they are gone.  The narrator, Allan Corduner does a masterful job of weaving the story, holding your interest and sucking you into the story.
 This is a book you will read with ever increasing speed, almost to the point of frenetic velocity, as Zusak's characters become real, grow and develop.  His writing highlights the incredibly different aspects of human nature, and how no one aspect belongs to any one sort of person -- we feel sympathy for our German and Jewish protagonists, and a confused ambivalence toward the Allied pilots bombing them. We sense the great power of words to do both great good and great evil, depending on whose hands are doing the writing and whose tongues are doing the speaking.
 Probably one of the best books I have ever read, this book still haunts my thoughts months after reading it.  Beautifully written and immediately accessible, Zusak tells the stories of Lisel Memminger, a young girl living under the thumb of Nazi Germany, and the people who inhabit her impoverished neighborhood, as seen through the eyes of Death, himself a character in the novel.<br/><br/>This deeply moving novel is being marketed as young adult fiction, but don't let that keep you from reading it, as it is as mature a handling of the subject matter as any could be.  My book club read it, and all but one of us proclaimed it the best book we'd read this year.<br/><br/>In some ways, it reminded me of "Water For Elephants" in that the language was very descriptive and the narrative exciting.  I couldn't wait to get to read this book each day, and I missed the characters when I'd finished it.<br/><br/>I read this book earlier in the year, and though I have wanted to review it, share it with everyone because it is so good, I have waited to write this.  In many ways it's hard to put into words just how great this book is.
 I purchased this book on my Kindle, which I totally love - but its one downside is that you can't pass a book along to somebody else when you're done with it. If I'd known how much I'd want to share this book, I would have bought a paper copy. I might actually go ahead buy a few copies just so I can share them.<br/><br/>I heard the following explanation of why it's in the "Teen Literature" genre (I don't know if this explanation is correct, but it makes sense): It was originally published in Australia in the normal "Literature" genre, and was fully intended for an adult audience. When the publisher brought it to America, though, they decided that books in the Literature genre don't sell as well here and it would get more exposure in the "Young Adult" and "Teen" market, so they threw it in there to make more money.<br/><br/>I think probably every teen SHOULD read this, in the same way they should all read The Diary of Anne Frank, but I doubt it will appeal to many of them. Certainly not to the same crowd of teens that's gone crazy recently over Twilight and Harry Potter before that.<br/><br/>It's the (fictional, but very true-to-life) story of a young girl raised by foster parents in Germany during World War II. Her family is hiding a Jew, and so is in constant danger of being discovered by the Nazis. (In this way, it's reminiscent of The Diary of Anne Frank but told from a completely different perspective.) Interestingly, the story is actually narrated by Death. Death himself is very much a character in the book even though he takes no direct hand in the plot other than quietly and compassionately collecting souls when their time comes. He interjects his own opinions and notes throughout. (At first these interjections seemed distracting, but before long they became one of my favorite aspects of the book.) By tying such a narrator so closely to the story the author ensures that the right mood is maintained throughout. The author's concept of an personified Death is very different than the ones we are used to. In one parenthetical statement Death even alludes to his more classic personification when he comments, "I like this human idea of the grim reaper. I like the scythe. It amuses me."<br/><br/>The main character of the book is Liesel. Everything she's ever had, even her family, has been taken from her, so early on in the book (the first chapter or two, if I recall), in attempt to have anything at all that is hers, she steals a book left accidentally on the ground by an apprentice grave digger just after the funeral of her younger brother. It's "The Gravedigger's Handbook". She can't read, and has no idea of what the book is - it's just one of the only things in the world that is hers now, so she hides it away like a treasure. When her foster father finds it, he realizes that she'd like to learn how to read. Being too poor to afford any other book, they use that one to teach her. He's hesitant about the subject matter but, in a wonderful illustration of the character's optimism in the face of even the most depressing situation he laughs and tells her as they get started, "Well, promise me one thing Liesel. If I die any time soon, you make sure they bury me right. No skipping chapter six or step four in chapter nine." The Gravedigger's Handbook becomes the first of several books that she steals, and the story tells how each one changes her life.<br/><br/>This is the first fictional novel to ever actually make me cry. A few times throughout the book I realized I was about to let loose a tear, but I managed to get through those without actually crying. (Typical male: Just had to man-up, ya know?) But then, as I finished it, my face was literally wet. It's an amazingly moving book. In addition to the tears, it also made me laugh in a lot of places, made me happy and inspired in a lot of places, and just generally ran the gamut of human emotion. I've never had a book affect me like that, and certainly not one that I knew was fictional. (But just because it's fictional doesn't mean it isn't full of truth. It shows many of the horrors of war in such realistic terms that you'd swear it could only be written by somebody in Anne Frank's position.)<br/><br/>I've always felt for the Jews who were persecuted during that war, but this book has given me a whole new appreciation for the few German citizens who were brave enough to protect some of these persecuted people, the ones who were wise enough to recognize the Nazi propaganda against the Jews  for what it was, and who were human enough to risk their lives and families to do what they could do to help the oppressed.<br/><br/>As far as actual objective quality of writing, I wouldn't go so far as to say that The Book Thief is written as well as a few others I've read. Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett comes to mind as one with higher quality writing, as does The Archer's Tale by Bernard Cornwell. But the writing here is incredibly poetic in many places, and when it comes to grabbing your emotions and making you feel like you're living in the story, I've never seen another book as well-done. Because I'd heard it was in the Teen section of the bookstore, I started it very skeptically, and it took a while for me to get used to the very odd narrative style - but by the time I was a third of the way through I was completely hooked.<br/><br/>Whoever it was at the publishing company who decided to call it "Teen Literature" needs to be strung up by the thumbs. I'll admit that if every teen read this book during their most impressionable years then it would probably make the world a better place because more of them would grow up into people who want to actively avoid war. But I doubt that many teens have the social maturity to really appreciate all that this book has to offer. I know there are many who do, and those that do have my complete respect, and I hope this book finds them. But the adult market is a far more appropriate venue for this book that I can only hope becomes regarded as a classic in years to come.
 What an amazing book!  It so aptly captured the sensitivity of a human heart....the heart of one who is truly human, in every sense of the word, during a horrendous period of humanity.  This is a story of survival - not for the sake of physically BEING, but for the sake of existing as a spiritual and emotional being.  I can't imagine how a movie will do this justice, but I'm so glad I read the book.  It should become a classic!
 THE BOOK THIEF painted the existence of people caught up in the horrors of war, through the eyes of innocent children, the struggles of poor people and innocents condemned by the ruling class as they attempt to go about their daily lives.  Leisel, the book thief, will tug at your heart strings as she goes about dealing with situations, the loss of her younger brother, abandoned by her mother and placed with a strange family in a war zone, at age eleven.  The book held my interest from cover to cover.  TIP - Read the book before seeing the movie.
 I really enjoyed this book.  I know this was only a  story. But  I also know there are people who actually had to live a live very similar to this story.  You knew her street would eventually end up being bombed and she would end up with the mayors wife.  Again because it's only a story.  However the end of the book puts it in a more realistic place because Leslie can't natures to age and life moves forward. The stories she could share with her children and grandchildren would be just mind blowing.  I love talking with elder people who have truly experienced life. That's not to say we in this current time period are not living life. It just seems amazing someone could live to tell such history.
 I wasn't sure who was telling the story. I assume it was the angel of death. However, it was very good. I have always been interested in the WWll and what it was like for the Germans. It is still so hard for me to understand how evil Hitler was. The characters in the book were very real and very young. I was so wrapped up in her life the end brought me to tears. It was sad and happy at the same time. I am not good at writing reviews so excuse my attempt at this one.
 I had to buy this for summer homework for a honors class I’m going to take, and it was amazing. The ending was sad though.<br/>It came on time and in perfect condition.
 The book begins a bit confusing with "Death" explaining himself, but after I got into the actually story and understood the writer's presentation, it turned out to be an excellent look at the wartime life of Nazi Germany. I did not like it that the writer told you about things to happen several chapters before they happened in the story, but other than that it was an excellent book that presented a very vivid picture of life at that time.
 I don't usually read or watch WWII books or movies but I can highly recommend "The Book Thief."  I knew nothing about the book but a friend wanted to see the movie, and I usually like to read the book first, assuming there is a book.  Excellent move.  The writing is definitely different and the narrator, Death, puts an interesting spin on the story.  Rather than focusing on the atrocities of WWII Germany, the book's main focus is the humanity of some.  Read the book and then go see the movie.
 I loved everything about this book. The characters were all thoughtfully written and believable. It was hard to see the story end. I could have read it for days.
 I had heard nothing about this book and read it for a book club.<br/>It is riveting.<br/>If you're into historical fiction, you'll like this WWII set book.<br/>I won't tell you anything about it, just expect it to haunt you during and after reading it.
 I found The Book Thief to be sweet and endearing.  In Kindle format I was unable to see the illustrations as they were too small but I was able to get the general idea.  The way the story is told and the imaginative approach to telling the story all gain it high marks from me.  Why didn't I give it five stars?  Mostly because I felt it gave credence to the protests of Germans of that time that they knew nothing of the atrocities, and I am not able to accept that as the truth.
 The Book Thief explores the reality of Hitlerian Germany from the late 1930s into the 40s through the experiences of a young woman whose story is told by Death.  Death is the ever present reality, but it is not the death of the extermination camps or the war front, though both loom ominously in the background. In this highly active moment in the long life of Death emerges the experience of Liesel, who is confronted by Death so soon in her young life she cannot possibly understand his character; however, life in the little town outside Munich offers immense possibilities for getting to know death on a more intimate level. Liesel's instinct is for life in all of its ordinary and extraordinary manifestations. Without much thought, she steals life by stealing books. The power of words to enhance life confronts the power of words to destroy life as Mein Kampf demonstrates. Mein Kampf is a looming even ironic presence throughout the novel.<br/><br/>I read this book for a book club to which I belong.  This was not the selection I voted for because I was not in the mood for another Holocaust novel.  The Book Thief is not that.  It's an allegory on living. Markus Zusak uses Germany under Hitler to explore what it means to be alive in the face of death.  We are always life in the face of death but rarely have to confront his presence so intensely. (I use the male pronouns here because the great purveyor of death in Hitlerian Germany is male.) For some reason I'm reminded of Thorton Wilder's "Our Town" where the most ordinary elements of life in the ever-presence of death become utterly beautiful and awesome.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in only one aspect: the novel was too long.  I had trouble getting through the last hundred pages or so.  The story ends up being tedious and repetitive; however, that should not keep a person from the experience.
 Zusak writes beautifully! You know the kind of writer who is so descriptive they take three pages to tell you the color of someone's eyes? This author takes four or five words and an entire portrait is before you. When I was through listening I started over immediately and went through it all over again. To tell the truth however, I am not sure the author's writing style didn't almost over shadow the story. Terrific read!
 The setting is Nazi Germany in a very poor part of a small town near a concentration camp.  The book centers around an orphan girl, named Liesel.  Her nights are full of nightmares and she uses reading and writing to cope with this.  Liesel is such a special and strong young female character.  She struggles with the evils of the times with her best friend, Rudy, her step-parents, and Max, the Jew they are hiding in their basement.
 A beautiful picture of a family (and one little girl in particular) struggling to live and do the right thing at one of the worst times in history. A compelling and through provoking read.
 The narrator, death,  offers an interesting perspective into the turmoil in the lives of small town Germans during the years of the Third Reich.  Death sympathetically follows this sly, innocent ,young girl and the town people as they, often unintentionally or out of self preservation, become involved with the Nazis and the consequences of that involvement.  " It is just a small story really about a girl, some words, an accordionist, some fanatical Germans, a Jewish fist fighter and quite a lot of thievery"<br/><br/>As is often noted the movie is a subset of the book but having seen the movie first we read the book.  The movie did seem to frame the book for us, the actors are well chosen and the book is very well written.  Read the book first and of course you will notice what is not included.  But do see the film at some point it is a good visualization and enhances the experience, first or last.
 On a scale of 1-10, I will definitely rate this book a 10. First, reading this book helps me to experience the suffering of the Jews, to understand the injustice of the society under Hitler, and to realize the hope and power of words. Second, this book was written in the perspective of Death who takes people’s soul after they died, it was interesting to see the perspective of Death in narrating this story. For these two aspects, I think this novel definitely deserves a 10. And I would like to recommend this awesome novel to everyone.
 It took a bit of getting used to the narrator at first but once I did, I enjoyed it. It was a good book but not one that leaves you with a "good" feeling when you are done but that is due to the subject--not the writing. Tough to read about the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, born in the wrong country and the implications. Made me realize how tough life was for some people and how lucky I am!!
 A unique narration by the grim reaper, a unique writing style, I was totally captivated once I started to read. Takes place during WWII in Germany but not your average fair. I would suggest reading "The Book Thief" just because of the unique way or is handled by the author. Of course it a good slice of life and very descriptive of the struggle during the war and the way it affected different individuals.
 A very dark and sad tale, beautifully written. The story of a young girl who at a bad time in her life, accidently steals a book and from the on continues to pick up books at sad times, which was most of her life.  Through her eyes we learn how accepting were the German people of the Nazis. Although things were deteriorating around her, as long as you weren't Jewish, your life continued in the usual vein.The story told in the first person , by Death, was very cleverly done, with comedy, pathos and Humanity.
 I read this because being a book lover, I was taken by the title.  I'm not one to be able to point out the writing styles of books, I'm more of a story gal, but the way this was written was excellent.  So beautiful.  I have the kindle edition and I shared SO many quotes from this book from Death's narration.<br/><br/>I put this on the list for my book club to vote for and it ended up being August's selection.  I'm rereading this happily and enjoying it all over again.<br/><br/>A must read in my opinion.  I was shedding tears through a smile at the end.
 In my family, I'm famous for reading the spoilers for movies and even occasionally some books . In a moment of suspense at whatever movie we might be attending, my husband can always turn to me when the tension gets to be just too much and ask me how things are going to turn out because he knows that I've read the spoiler. Why would I do this you might ask? To protect myself from caring too much. My theory has always been that if I know things are going to turn out badly I won't get too attached to the characters.<br/><br/>Imagine my surprise when The Book Thief destroyed all of my carefully laid plans. Since the book, which takes place in Nazi Germany, is narrated by Death it isn't giving away too much to say that I knew things couldn't possibly turn out happily for Liesel Meminger, the book thief. Death himself even gives us very broad and specific hints at what lies in store for Liesel, and those she cares about throughout the book. Despite all this, I fell hard for almost each and every character in this book. I actually found myself wiping away a few tears as I finished the last few pages. I've been reading a lot of great books lately, but this one really stands out as an amazing read.<br/><br/>The story is that of Liesel Meminger, a young German girl who we meet just prior to the rise of power of the Nazi party. Liesel is sent to live with some foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, who live on Himmel street, just outside of Munich. Liesel has lost everything; and is haunted especially by the death of her brother which she witnessed. Somehow, she finds comfort in words and books, despite her inability to read. Hans, her amazing foster father, teaches her to read. This love of books, especially stolen ones, becomes Liesel's salvation, and her means of survival as her nation goes up in flames.<br/><br/>I honestly can't say too many wonderful things about this book. I honestly loved everything about it. The characters are so wonderful, so amazing, so imperfectly human, and the story will inspire you and break your heart all at the same time.
 I first saw the movie and it moved me so that I wanted more, so I bought the book.  As is in most literature that gets turned into movies, the book is far superior to the movie in that the details and thoughts of all the characters, including the narrator, just simply lift you into that world of Nazi Germany.  The characters are so richly developed that you cry when they cry and you celebrate when they celebrate!  I would recommend this book to anyone who has a deep love of literature and wants their souls to experience just a small part of what it would have been like to have lived in Nazi Germany during World War II.
 Nazi era human stories narrated by Death. Engaging and unique writing style. A German hides a Jew in his basement as a payback for a man who saved his life in WW1. First book stolen was a manual on how to bury bodies,  It was found by the sister of a boy who died on a train and had to be buried in the snow.<br/>The girl did not know how to read yet.  Her mother takes her to the German family for safekeeping anad the German man becomes her Papa and teachers her the alphabet.
 I loved this book!  I could not put it down!  I even woke up in the middle of the night and read it.  Be prepared for a tear-jerker of a story.  I never like the movie version of books so I was glad I read this book .  My 10 year old daughter saw the movie though.  We were still able to talk about the topics in the book .  She's a big history lover so it was fun discussing the characters and the events of the story and the events of history.l
 The beginning seemed a little creepy, considering it was DEATH who was narrating - but after the first chapter, I really got INTO it. It captured all the twists and turns of being a little girl in Nazi Germany. Like all good books, I really wanted more and hated to get to the end - I wanted more. Sad at times, yet an interesting look into the psyche of people who are under great stress, and other people who are just born bullies. I think I'll recommend it for my Book Club soon
 Markus Zusah has an incredible talent for touching your heart, and it is not simply because his topic naturally goes there.  While the narrator as Death and the quirky metaphorical imagery may be difficult to grasp in the beginning, the characters are enchanting.  Even Death falls in love with them.  My heart is breaking and yet I am glad that I found this book.  I do not know if I could see the movie version in a theater because I would need dark glasses to walk out into the light.
 When I first bought this book, I expected it to be a holocaust story, where a Jew tells his story about going to a concentration camp and experiencing the many terrors the Nazis brought onto the innocent holocaust victims. Don't get me wrong, I have read many of those kinds of books, and each one is excellent in its own way, but I was not expecting to read what I read.<br/><br/>The way I interpreted the book, I didn't look at the situations as if they related to the holocaust. Of course, I knew that the book itself was generally about the holocaust, but I saw it as life today.  I didn't see Hitler against a Jew, I saw a tormentor against a victim. I didn't see a German girl searching for her dead family and friends who were killed in an air raid, I saw a person grieving over the loss of their loved ones.<br/><br/>Overall, this book is a book that will change my life and the way I see things forever. It showed me the honest and painful truth of life, and it taught me to be thankful for my life as well as my loved ones lives, before it is to late.  This book is not a fiction, it is a true story.
 This is just a great book.  It is , of course, a story but is also a realistic telling of how people had to live during that time.  The German people were as much to be pitied as to be blamed.  There were thugs and bullies but there were also people  who were just trying to stay safe and survive.  War is not nice for anyone.  In spite of enormous danger, this family risked all to save one fellow human who just happened to be a Jew.  And Death was everywhere.
 I loved this book for so many reasons and I can't name most of them without giving away parts of the story. I can only say that it has been one of the most worthwhile reads of my life and that I know I will re-read it very soon.
 I was a bit confused in the beginning of the book but quickly became enamoured with the story line.  It was hard to put down.  I would definitely recommend this book.
 I am in awe of the author of The Book Thief, and in awe of the book itself. Read it before you see the movie. The Nazi Era from the economically poor German citizens' perspectives, in all the variety of personalities and lives. The writing... written word is unique as no other story I have read, poetic and thought provoking. The simplicity, heart, cruelty, and complexity of human nature in a delicate and fierce, fragile and strong tale of a girl and heroes and Hitler.
 The book thief is filled  with the oddest moments of happiness amongst tragedy. It is truly a wonderful read that fills you with emotions from sorrow to happiness and everything in between. While it shows humans at their worst, it also portrays them at their best, which, oddly enough, lends itself to a hopeful image of humanity, not perfect but flawed. I would recommend it to everyone as it is one of the most powerful books I have ever read.
 Such an amazing book!  I loved the point of view writing.  I haven't had a book wow me like this in such a long time.  Truly wonderful reading.
 This is a one of a kind work of art that grabs you and won't let you go.  When I finished reading it, it moved me so much that I couldn't leave it.  I needed to stay there. It is a young adult book only in the sense that Anne Frank is a young adult book. It mirrors Anne in many ways. It is a must read for anyone who values fine literature. The depth, beauty, and sadness is astounding. The subject matter is gripping. If you only read one book this year, let it be this one.
 This book touched me deeply beyond anything thing I have read recently.  The whole concept of a Book Thief in this period of history in Germany during WWII resonates with the pathos, pain, sacrifice and convictions of the major characters.<br/>The author Markus Zusak has not only given life to words by his splendid writing, but has captured the turmoil of its main character young Liesel and her foster parents and their house guest, a young Jewish man.<br/>After I shed heartfelt tears ( not a usual reaction when reading a good book), I ordered I Am the Messenger by this talented writer.  I look forward to another great experience.
 Read this at the suggestion of friend who said it had made an impression on his life. I wouldn't go that far, but it was a well-paced story without blood and guts of WWII.
 The best feature of this book is that the autor uses "death" as the narrator. Death can be sarcastic, sensitive and, at times, even funny.<br/>The book is of "breathtaking ambition" as one reviewer put it. It covers a bit too much for my taste, making it hard to answer a simple question as: what is the book about? Suffice it to say that the book is about the early years of the book thief, written in a very fresh and innovative manner. Enjoy!
 The Book Thief was a very good read. The author used the narrator's character skillfully - it felt more like a conversation, which was a very interesting approach, considering who the narrator was. Main characters were well fleshed out and very knowable. I have visited Dachau and after reading this book, better understand the German civilians' attitude and predicament during the war.
 The Book Thief was an excellent book, told from an interesting point of view.  It seemed strange in the beginning, and I wasn't sure I wanted to continue, but once you get past the first chapter it makes sense and is very clever.  Readers or listeners for the audio book will be drawn in to the different lives during this sad time of Nazi Germany.  It was a captivating book that brought laughter and tears throughout the entire story.  I listened to the audio book on a long road trip, and loved the voice of the reader.<br/><br/>I only gave it four stars because of the language used.
 Death narrates the story of an adolescent girl coming of age in a poor village in Nazi Germany. Most stories situated in this era focus on the suffering of the Jewish people, but this book demonstrates that the fuhrer's policies wreaked havoc on the German people as well.<br/><br/>Liesel is called the book thief because she loved and took books, but the real book thieves of course were the Nazis.<br/><br/>A gripping book.
 A great book. Told by an unexpected point of view makes it very unique. You will experience all the range of emotions from the first few pages to the final ones.
 I hadn't seen the movie but had heard about it so I thought I'd try the book. I really enjoyed reading this book and stayed up late a couple of nights buried in the story.  It's a coming of age story of a young girl in Germany as the Nazis were coming to power and into WWII.  The book is well written, the characters are knowable.
 I actually started this book once but was confused as to who the narrator was.  The lists of what was coming in the upcoming chapter was confusing too.  I read another book then went back to this.  I am so glad I did!  Read this book !  Very humanizing.  Unpredictable characters, just when you feel you know a character they surprise you.  Liselle is now my new hero.  I haven't seen the movie yet, will rent when it comes out on DVD, hope they stayed with the book story.
 This book was chosen for our Book Club this month. It was a much loved book by everyone there which is 16.<br/>I found the author to be very creative in his writing, very sensitive. This is rough subject matter no matter who the writer is. Markus is a excellant job. I would have judged him to be a older writer, I was surprised at how young he is. Thanks to him for giving us such a great book to read.<br/>Lillian
 After writing so many poor book reviews (partly my fault for choosing such terrible reads), I've finally found a goodie.<br/><br/>The way Zusak manages to tell a story in such childish positivity and innocence in such a horrible era, is priceless. It was escapism at its best - submersing yourself in the fear of Nazi Germany, and then escaping into a child's mind. I found myself concerned about whether Liesel would ever learn to read, or whether she would ever give Rudy a kiss... And when I finally felt lost in this world of childish concerns, BAM! Zusak brings the devastation of the Nazis back in our faces. It's almost like double (triple?) escapism. And it's brilliant.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>This is one of the books I would take with me at the end of the world.
 I loved the imagery from this book.  The author has a style that is so unique with the narrator being Death overseeing the events surrounding Liesel, her foster family and the neighbors on Himmel Street.  Like others have written...it is not a fast read book (and I am not saying it dogs along either!) but you get totally drawn into these characters and their reaction to the war in Germany.  I am eager to see how this book is portrayed in the movies
 I read all the time, lots of different types of books. I really like historical fiction.  Book Thief takes place during WWII, however, it is a different kind of WWII hist. fiction because it is from the German (poor) perspective (the characters).<br/>In the beginning I kept reading to figure out who was telling the story.....that is a little different than most books, too.<br/>This story shows that not all Germans were in favor of the Nazis and what they did.  Some German citizens tried to help the Jews, and tried to make a difference.  Even the very poor Germans, who this story focuses on, who didn't have enough to eat themselves during this horrible time in history tried to help the Jews.  I thought the ending was somewhat of a surprise.
 The narrator was omniscient which can sometimes seem too removed and impersonal. This story made the omniscient character see the characters he was narrating because of who he was, an angel of death. His style of writing and voice have moved to the top of my list of favorites.
 The Book Thief" by Markus Zusak has sold over ten million copies. In a perfect world, I would hope that this book is read by a billion people, starting with children in the sixth grade and working its way up to people of all ages. This is the best book I have read by an author over the last ten years, excluding non-fiction and historical biographies. It is by no means a piece of high literature, which one might associate with writers like Proust, D.H Lawrence, Conrad, or Dickens, but it is just as compelling and its creative force and greatness lies in an unbelievable cast of characters, an amazing story, and an honesty that rings out loudly and clearly. I've read many great books that have dealt with the second World War and the Holocaust, but I don't know any that have touched me quite like this book. This is a book that should be required reading. "Words" are very important and how they are used can make the difference between life and death, war and destruction, happiness and despair. I shed many tears while reading this book, and laughed many times, and the rollercoaster of emotions I experienced were well earned by the masterful storytelling and writing by its author. AMAZING!!!!
 I had forgotten that I read this book before. With the movie out, it piqued my interest and I continued to re-read. With my lack of memory, I find I can do this and enjoy books all over again. The format is highly unusual with death (or the soul carrier) being the narrator. While it may feel as if the story jumps around and seems to obtuse at times, the reader gets the hang of it and it becomes hard to put down. Perhaps the format mirrors what many German citizens were feeling at the time. It is a different perspective of what it was like to be an ordinary German citizen forced to participate in Hitler's insanity. It becomes especially difficult when personal values conflict with the party's, especially when hiding a Jew.
 No need to repeat the synopsis in the book description, which covers it well. I'll just add that this story is beautiful, sublime, tragic, humorous, and sweet all at the same time, with unforgettable characters. It should be a classic fictional favorite along titles such a To Kill a Mockingbird, Anna Karenina, Frankenstein, and All the King's Men (I know, and eclectic list, but this book is unique too). Simple as the prose may be, the story is just so full of heart and wisdom, and creatively told by Death. I borrowed this book from the library, but then had to buy one for myself because I would read it again.
 The reviewers on Amazon overwhelmingly suggest (and I heartily agree) that Marcus Zusak's THE BOOK THIEF is an amazing read.  As a ninth-grade English teacher, I'd like to add that this book works extremely well in the classroom.  With Death as the narrator, students eagerly analyze and discuss point-of-view.  And, there are many wonderful metaphors and similes, making this a great resource for introducing figurative language.  I've been teaching for twenty-three years, and THE BOOK THIEF elicits more discussion from my students than any other novel.  Please consider using this novel in your classroom, especially with reluctant readers.
 Not enough words to describe how wonderful this book is! Love, life, death, art, beauty, truth, lies, nobility, cruelty, selflessness, -everything in one book. Very complex ideas but easy to read. Beautiful, lyrical language but brutal honesty.  Each character has been fully developed and contributes essential depth to the story. Heart-achingly poignant. Everyone should read this book at least twice and buy it as a gift for good friends. I'm grateful to my friend for recommending it!
 I'll admit, it took me a while to get into this book. The narrator is not someone you would expect to be narrating a story, but makes perfect sense as the book goes on. Liesl Meminger is growing up in Hitler's Germany. And this is a fascinating look at how normal, every day Germans probably lived their lives during the war, each clinging to one thing that keeps them going.<br/><br/>Do not miss this book. It's a terrific story that will keep you up late, reading "just one more page."
 Many people have given this book 5 stars.  It is a great story and with an enormous amount of detail.  The reason I gave it four is because of the layout.  The story jumps a bit much from present to future and back again.  Some of the suspense is lost  because the author has the narrator give details about future events before the story ever even gets there.<br/>  I've concluded that this book needs to be read rather quickly so that the interest is retained.  I didn't have the time so as I read I found it to be somewhat too bland for my taste.<br/>  I do recommend this book but be ready to get through it in a hurry or else you set yourself up for disappointment.
 Each character is heartfelt and described well.  It is historically correct as far as I have studied.  If you like to read stories about how people were affected by the Third Reich then this book is for you.  It does have some mild language but I would let my 12 year old boys read it and I am selective on their reading material with any foul language.  I will be reading it again!  This will become a classic!
 This book grabbed me from page one and kept me riveted until its heart wrenching conclusion. The narrator is a strange choice; but when you're about 3/4 through, it is clear why he was chosen. While reading this story, I couldn't help thinking how the events likely happened over and over again in real life - just in different flavors. For me, that just made it all the more devastating. I grieved for the Leisel, the main character, and for all of the lost souls.
 I found this story very touching.  I love history.  Nazi Germany is a very difficult time-period in world history.  We should never forget the horrors that took place there. This story and the story-teller is quite unique.  I must admit that I did cried at the end of this book.  Each of the characters played a vital role in the story and they all came together perfectly.  The only problem I had with the book was the taking of the Lords name in vain.  I usually will not read or listen to a book that has profanity, but I made an exception because of the story line.
 A beautifully written book, told with unique imagination, of the life of a young German girl during WWII.  Of course it being war, it was hell. The well done characters were wonderful, some incredibly good people, some awful, and then of course there were Nazis who are in a class of evil all their own. I will be thinking of Liesl for a long time.
 I loved reading this story written by death himself. A unique perspective. The characters touch you deeply. It made me cry and smile.<br/>Just glorious. Highly recommended read
 I heard that the film version was coming out, so decided I MUST read the book first.  What wonderful writing.  I am so enthralled that I want to read everything that this author has written.  Written in such a vivid and illustrative way I deliberately re-read sentences to marvel at how descriptive and emotional his words were written.  Although marketed as a book for young adults I (no longer young) enjoyed it immensely.
 ...and done with a unique style to carry it all off.  His character portraits not to be the nerve with the mastery.
 The storyteller was such a surprise I had to 're-read the beginning twice to make sure my impression was accurate. The style and descriptive wording was refreshingly unusual.  I know this is now a movie, but I don't see how any director can evoke an atmosphere of understanding without the words that are written in this book. It was hard to get anything done while reading this book since I never wanted to put it down.  If you love to read- this is the story for you.
 This is a great book.  The tone and characters are perfect.  One of the best books I have read in recent years.
 I approached this book a bit skeptically since it is considered a young adult book, however, I found The Book Thief one of the most heart-rending books that I have ever read. If you are a Nazi Germany buff, you will find this book is very different from what you have read. The Book Thief is a view of Nazi Germany through the eyes of children.<br/><br/>When Liesel Meminger's brother unexpectedly dies, her mother sends her to live with a small family in the town of Molching. Her new father is a gentle and caring man who makes her transition as easy as possible, but her new mother, Rosa Hubermann, is a slightly rougher and colorful character. Rosa, however, loves Liesel in her own unique way.<br/><br/>Liesel soon makes friends with a neighborhood boy named Rudy Steiner. Rudy and Liesel get into all sorts of mischief together and share a very deep and sincere connection. Liesel also befriends a boy named Max Vandenburg. Max Vandenburg is a Jew that Hans and Rosa Hubermann secretly keep in their basement at a time when being Jewish or sympathizing with anyone who is Jewish is extremely dangerous.<br/><br/>The first half of the book is about developing the relationships with Liesel and her new family and friends.You should be warned that the author takes his time with this.  Some people thought the book read a bit slow, but the author, in fact, did an exceptional job of developing and describing the different relationships Liesel enages in after her arrival in Molching.<br/><br/>Nazi Germany is not exactly my favorite time period when reading novels, but The Book Thief took an unpleasant period in time and retold it through the eyes of three innocent children. I would recommend The Book Thief to anyone who appreciates an author who takes his time developing characters and relationships. This was a very emotional novel that everyone needs to read.
 With the teasers about the film coming out, I finally purchased the book.  I always prefer to read something before it is turned into a movie, or musical or play to learn first hand what the author intended.<br/><br/>It blew me away with such beautiful writing, and it's ability to straddle the line of speaking to the horror of that era without making it unbearable.  I could not wait to share this book with others, and their reactions to reading it did not disappoint. Bravo!
 I bought this for my 12 year old daughter shortly after the movie was released in theaters as she said she wanted to read it.  I decided to read it first.  The opening Prologue is very interesting and somewhat graphic.  I continued to read the book and can't put it down.  I can't wait to finish reading it.  It reminds me of the Hunger Game triology, I that it talks about death of others but not too much detail. I get a few chuckles here and there too.  I like the book.
 I have had the opportunity to read this book three times and started and put it down.  I heard they were making it into a movie and finally picked it back up and read it!  I loved it!  My grandfather and grandmother and my mother and her sister lived through the war!  I have a greater respect for what they went through after reading this wonderfully written book!  I highly recommend this book!  A very touching fast reading book!
 I first learned of this book this summer when I read a list of 20 "Must Read" YA titles. I was immediately intrigued by the synopsis and quickly got my hands on a copy. I wasn't actually able to give it my full attention until a couple of weeks ago, but there is no doubt in my mind that this book belongs on a list of 20 "Must Read" YA titles. I have read a lot of books over the years that have impacted me in significant ways and left me in awe of the amazing talent of their authors. The Book Thief is one of the most amazing books I have read. The writing style, while unique, is outstanding, and Zusak's use of figurative language is stunning. I can easily see this book as a staple in High School English classes, replacing outdated canonical works. I look forward to reading more from this author, and I will be reading I Am the Messenger in the near future.(less)
 I read this book in three days, and the words will not let me go.<br/><br/>Images that will stick with me:<br/><br/>Moments of beautify, and I wonder, "Is this really Germany, Nazi Germany?"<br/>the boy on the train, his reappearance to his sister<br/>the rough German mother, good in crisis, and finally beautiful.<br/>The love of Leisel and Rudy, and their final moments<br/>The tenderness of the man with the accordion<br/>the Jew-in-my-basement paranoia<br/>the boxing match with the Furher<br/>the young girl reading in the basement, reading to give life<br/>the words of the narrator, of death, and his surprising weariness, insight, compassion<br/>the colors, the breathtaking colors<br/>the words, their preciousness, their power for evil and good<br/>the Word Shaker, the tear, the hope<br/>the haunting
 This book was slow going to start and a look into the lives of a poor community during WWII, in particular a young girl who was given to another family to raise when he mother can no longer provide for her. She faces many challenges, one of which is learning to read and how to obtain the books she desires to accomplish her dreams.<br/><br/>The story also shows how the people of one community survive the rationing and occupied their time in a basement during the bombings all the while hiding a Jewish man in the book thief's basement.
 This is a brilliantly written book; a work of fiction based on the stories Marcus heard around the family dining table in Sydney. His parents, one from Austria and the other from Germany, emigrated to and met in Australia after World War 11. I particularly liked the "narrator" who was God's assistant; using colour to describe thoughts and scenes made the people and the setting exceptionally graphic; my favourite quote "their eyes were the colour of agony" , described the procession of Jews dragging their emaciated bodies forced to walk through the streets on their way to Dachau. However the book also has many poignant momemts and patches of humour.  I belive that his book will draw me back to read it many more times in the coming years.
 It seems that many readers miss one of the lessons of this book. So think about this. The story concerns Germans in Munich during World War II. We meet ordinary, lower class, blue collar German families living life the best they can. I think they are beginning to realize bad times are coming, but they do not realize just how bad. The children of these families could be children anywhere. They laugh, play soccer, scrape their knees, go to school, fight, and laugh some more. One of them steals books. One dreams of being as great an athlete as Jesse Owens. As they grow, their lives are shaped by the politics and war surrounding them. We know the story of World War II so there is no need to go into it here. Did we know or realize that the citizens of the country that became our enemy were in reality so much like us? Did they know that we were so much like them? Did we see each other as ENEMY? Or as just another kid to play with?<br/><br/>Zusak gives his reader a fine story, with rounded, true characters. He brings a large, dramatic period of time down to an accessible small place, where we can go and feel we know the characters, or folks just like them. We see bravery, heroism, unselfishness, and love in circumstances we simply cannot imagine. And if we are truly fortunate, we will not forget what we read here in and between the lines.<br/><br/>I took a few years before reading this book. There was too much hoopla about it. I have a bit of sensitivity about the Nazis and that period. I didn't want to read this. Now, I have, and I am grateful to Zusak for giving us Liesel, Rudy, and all the others. And for shaking up my thinking. If you have not, read it now. Be you adult, an older teen, someone who lived through that period and remember, read this book. If you are very young, put this book on your shelf and wait a little -- but read it when you are ready.
 this story is simply captivating. it's am amazing look into the life of a young girl in Nazi Germany.they don't sugar coat the reality, they tell the truth in all its heartbreaking honesty. Liesel will hold you close to her. she'll give you a peak into her mind and world. you will truly feel as if you walk with her down Himmel Street. you will meet, cranky big hearted momma, gentle accordion playing papa, rough boisterous Rudy, and a whole cast of characters that you will never be able to forget. Nor will you want to.
 I read this book today - all in one day.  Was it good?  I don't know if that word describes what I found here. It was mesmerizing - captivating - and enchanting. I lived those days and years as though I were there throughout every moment<br/>After the first couple of film clips I no longer watched any. I found them distracting - my focus was on reading the next events - plus over years I've found that I prefer the images in my mind to those Hollywood chooses<br/>Do I recommend this book?  Oh yes - without reservation
 Well, I finished THE BOOK THIEF last night. A book that as you read, the story becomes so very real. It is set during pre-WWII in a small town in Germany near Munich. Much of the propaganda spewed then is being heard now. Sometimes word for word. As you read it you realize the innocent people that were effected by the cruel politics of the time are much like us. If we don't speak up we will be trying to survive on Rosa's soup too.
 This was a wonderful book.  Most stories about this part of history are ususally from the stand point of the Jewish people and their horrible times in concentration camps.  This story was more about those who were not being sent to the camps but about those who were trying to survive on the outside.  Of course there was reference to the Jewish persecution and the agony of that part of history and the monster that Hitler was.  It is a must read!
 As a teenager I read my first book by Markus Zusak, I Am The Messenger. The wording, the story, the characters, everything about that book drew me in and it has stayed with me for years. I recently stumbled across The Book Thief and I know it will stay with me forever. This novel wore me down with its beauty and sadness. The words drew me in. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that it was the same author who had previously haunted me that wrote this. Mr. Zusak is a master of words. He strings them together in ways that make you feel and taste them.<br/><br/>The Book Thief hurt my soul to read. I felt heavy after reading because of the sheer beauty in his words. Liesel, Rudy, Papa, Max. My heart ached for each and every one of them and I felt each and every single loss.<br/><br/>I have recommended this book to every one I know and this is one I will always go back to.
 My friend recommended this book to me and I was instantly intrigued. All I knew about the plot was that a girl steals books. This really struck a chord in me since I absolutely love books. So I ordered the book and when it arrived I dove in. Little did I know the emotional journey I was about to take part in because of this book. It is a beautiful and heart-warming story depicting what war looks like through the eyes of a child.<br/><br/>Liesel Meminger is taken to live with a foster family in Molching, Germany during World War II. On the way her brother dies and she is first tantalized with the thrill of stealing a book, The Gravedigger's Handbook. Then she arrives in Molching and is forced to face the realities of real life. These realities are interspersed with the same thrill of stealing more books and allowing the words to change her perspective on life and the world around her.<br/><br/>The best part about the book is that the story is written from the perspective of death; a very interesting twist that I was not initially expecting, but one that I came to really appreciate. Death has the ability to be objective in its analysis of mankind. The parting words say it all, "I am haunted by humans." This book truly shows the power that can come from words. As well as how the human spirit endures, even after so much tragedy and destruction. It is a must-read for everyone!
 Literally could not put it down. One of the best stories I've read in a long time. Highly recommend to anyone. The characters, the story, the narrator...fantastic!!! Original story told from a new perspective!
 Markus Zusak has written a beautiful story of compassion and love during a cruel and deplorable time in world history.  It is not a love story, but of the love of people for each other and the consequences of their actions.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to anyone and I would even suggest that they see the movie first because it doesn't take anything away from the book.  The book then goes into more depth and more detail of all that happens during these peoples lives.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book.
 This is one of my favorite books ever written. It tells a fascinating story, which is based on facts. We read it for book club and I didn't think I'd like it because it takes place in WWII Germany, but it's a wonderful book full of hope, love, forgiveness, understanding, trust, compassion, faith, and more. It's a rather short book, a quick read and well-worth the time.<br/>Cynthia Cooks/Author
 Wonderful story of love, family, the innocence of childhood, and the horrors of war. Markus Zusak takes care that the narrator, death, does not unnecessarily interfere with the story, but allows him enough involvement in the story to care deeply for the main character, Liesel. The relationship between Liesel and Rudy is the kind one can only hope every child has; a true friend to the end. Great YA read!
 What a beautiful, haunting story. This is a book I feel should be read by everyone. A required reading in schools. Told from an interesting perspective, just a wonderful read. Thank you Zusak.
 Took me a while to get into this particular style of writing---there is some definite confusion at first regarding the narrator. Although the content can be disturbing, once you get going, you don't want to put the book down. (I haven't seen the movie adaptation.)<br/>Some of the situations were not believable---things sometimes work out too positively for the characters. But overall, these are minor flaws to the story and outcomes.<br/>Comparisons from other reviewers to the Anne Frank diaries should not be made---this book is fiction-based and the story has a fantasy association.<br/>Recommended for book clubs and those wanting a perspective on growing up within Germany during WWII.
 This book made you feel like you were in Germany during the bombing by the British.  Not only does this book cover the daily deprivations (lack of food and heat), it also covered the terror of being bombed.  It also showed that not everyone thought the Natzis were right.  How terrifying to be afraid of being caught sheltering a friend, and doing it anyway.  Reading was an escape for the book thief.  Having death as the narrator was also a very imaginative approach.
 An incredible story which kept me (and left me) breathless and sobbing from its insight into human nature and poignancy.  I know it's a clutch-to-my-heart book when as soon as I reach the last page I turn to the first page to start over because the thought of leaving the characters is just too unbearable.  The emotional qualities of the narrator of the book is sheer genius.  I read a lot of books - this one is exceptional.
 The book, as many have already stated, is narrated by Death which gives it a different spin.  However some of the phrases and images are so haunting in the way that Death expresses them that it gives the book an unusual beauty.  The only downside of this is that (for me) it created a certain disconnect from the characters themselves which prevented what could have been an unbelievably emotional experience.  I liked it a lot though.
 Phenomenal book, one of the best fictional holocaust stories ever told. Heck, probably one of the most poignant holocaust stories ever told period, fiction or not. Zusak has a beautiful way with words - the book isn't graphic or full of gore, but it paints a very clear and harrowing picture all the same. This book is not a beach-read; you will cry. The entire last forty pages you'll be in the fetal position practically. But it's so worth it. The Book Thief is a classic.
 I thought the ending was a bit rushed.  Seems to me that a little more information about her life "after" would have been nice.  I don't want to give anything away for the person who wants to read it.  But, there was so much detail "before", that a just a tad more about the "after" would have been more satisfying.  The book was excellent otherwise.  Enjoy.
 This was an  amazing read.  It nuances the "the cost" that the children of the non-jewish residents paid for witnessing their government and often their families collaborating in the atrocities against the Jews.  It explores the pain and also the quiet heroism that some of the most vulnerable paid in taking a stand against their government's terrible injustice.  It is a story of how the youngest among us can witness how to be brave, authentic and survive with their humanity intact.  Well written, no sentimentalism, just raw powerful truth.
 Most wartime stories tell of soldiers.  The Book Thief tells of how children, families and individual civilians struggle to survive war. Despite a grim beginning (the death of a six-year-old boy) and the use of Death as a narrator, The Book Thief ultimately focuses less on loss and more on the gift of human connection.<br/><br/>It describes ordinary human beings coping with extraordinary times. Some do so with generosity, others with an eye to personal gain. Whether deserving or not, the privations and bombs of war fall on them all. Some survive. Some don't.<br/><br/>The lucky ones are those who have managed to steal a piece of each other's hearts.
 One of the books that I enjoyed reading because (1) Death unusually narrates the whole story, (2) plenty of adorable characters, (3) written by a man ( I am so tired of soap-opera stories, NY times best sellers, written by female writers, and there is no evil characters except Hitler. Though I like most of the characters,  i think mayor's wife would be more enigmatic if there were no direct communication with the book thief.
 I read The Book Thief for an upcoming book club meeting.  When I learned it was classified as young adult fiction, I wasn't sure I wanted to read it; however, I found it totally engrossing and emotionally affecting. The book certainly did not shy away from the horrors of the war, it made it more horrifying by drawing the characters so fully and describing daily life in exquisite detail. Using Death as an impartial narrator made the sadness and loss stand out even more. I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more by this author.
 This is a good look into the ordinary German citizen's life during WWII. They weren't all Nazi's. There were some good people living in impossibly sad situations. Although she had a tragic start, the Book Thief did find some normalcy and parental affection. Very worth reading.
 I will come back to a real review of this book.  I wanted to read it before we went to see the movie, so I am rushing it a bit.  Every piece I've read has been meaningful, insightful, instructional, developing the characters and the historical times.  Hard to get through.  Left me with tears as well as chuckles.  And a more meaningful picture of the rise of Hitler's regime and the effect it had on the people in surrounding towns and villages.  Especially from a child's poignant point-of-view.
 I almost don't know where to begin.  The story of Liesl is a study in strong heroines and stretches emotions to the limit.  Oh, to feel the power of a life so well spent.  Thank you Markus for such a unique style, rich characters and masterful craftsmanship.  Truly, this is one of the great novels of this century.  I read three or more books a week and this ranks right up there with my first love, Thomas Mann!
 This story was told from a unique point of view. There were the usual characters for a story about this time period but the addition of Death as a narrator made it much more interesting.  I found it easy to understand the characters and their motivations.  When I first heard about this book, I thought it would be another dark and depressing book about a very dark and depressing time but it turned out to be very entertaining and thought provoking.  I even learned a little German!
 Having grown up in post war Germany this book brought back many memories of the small streets ans houses of Himmel Street,  off the many war widows dressed in black and rarely smiling  This book gave me a clearer understanding of what the older generation was referring to when they whispered of sons and husbands having been lost in Russia, and the millions of Jews who went missing in the in the middle of the night without explanation.
 This is a story that I couldn't stop thinking about long after the last page. It's a long story with some chapters being a little dry. But it moved me to tears in many places. I've never read a book narrated by Death, which was very gripping. But I can't say enough about these characters. I felt like I knew them personally and could relate so well to them. I can't recommend this book enough.
 What was WWII like for a poor German family struggling to survive while hiding a youg Jew in their basement?<br/>This book tells the story of a young girl growing up in a time of war, poverty, and loss.  Through the love and the gentle care<br/>And patience of her foster-father, she learns the power of words and books.<br/>The book is narrated by Death, which is only fitting in this tale of war, hunger, and fear--but also friendship and love.<br/>Great book that will touch your heart.
 I think I'm not deep enough to "get" what the underlying theme is. Maybe had I watched the movie first, I would more fully understand. I kept waiting for "that aha moment". It didn't come. The German perspective on the war is something I'm very interested in, having heard so many people say "they didn't know what was happening at the time." From this writing, I'd say, maybe they didn't, because they were too caught up in their own demise.
 This is among my favorite books I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in a fictional German view during the course of WWII
 I rated The Book Thief highly because of its ordinary human perspective on World War II through the eyes of Death. Now that is different. How often do we see Death as narrator in a book that is so lively and human! The book begins with a ten year old girl losing her mother and brother because of the hardships caused by the war. The stolen books seem to connect her to her community and to the suffering Jewish man her adopted father rescues. First, though, she develops her relationship to her father through books; the others come later. Even though THhe Book Thief" is rated for young people, it can be enjoyed by adults as well.
 It took me a while to get through this book but my perseverance paid off. It is written from a very unique point of view. I feel like I better understand a period in history that I would have never felt connected to if it were not for the words in this book.  Take the time to read this and remember that although these characters are fictional, there were real live people that lived and died through this period in history.
 This book was unlike most of the books I usually read but I enjoyed its power and language.<br/>My only fault with the book was that the layout would change significantly and would be difficult to read on my Kindle.<br/>Still I found this a good book to read and enjoy.<br/>The characters had soul and were true to what humans can do.<br/>This book is worth the reading.<br/>As an aside the narrator reminds me of Terry Pratchett's Death in his discworld series.
 There are a few books in my 70+ years that have touched my heart and stayed with me. This is certainly one of them. This is an amazing work of art. The story, narrated by "death", caught my attention and imagination in the first few paragraphs. I could not put this book down. It is one of the rare few that I will read again. It is a must read, so please do so. You will not be disappointed.
 This story is probably what it was really like in Germany during the war.  It is so sad yet fascinating.  I have never read a book written by Death.  I didn't want to lay this one down.  Good job.
 I have read many books about the war and the history behind it. this author give a new style of writing to the story, it is a story of a<br/>young girl  and her journey through this period. It is different look about the German people that were fed information from a government who denied the truth from its  citizens. It also gives a different on living in Nazi  Germany. I would encourage people with an interest in this time in history to read this book.
 What a very rich story. The characters were deeply moving. This is truly a story with characters that will stay with you for a long time to come.
 I was very captivated by the story in The Book Thief. It is another visit to the rise of Hitler in Germany around 1933. Lately books on this time in history have been emphasizing events through the eyes of the German people who were not enthralled with what was happening. This is an excellent book for young adults who can learn about this time in history and the dilemmas the German people faced. Books like these illuminate the costs of war to all involved and help us to see how many victims there were.
 I found this book difficult to get into to but it was worth persevering because it evolved into a gripping story of a young girl's growing up in a small town in Nazi Germany before and during the Second World War, living with adopted parents. themselves existing in straightened circumstances. There is much of the milk of human kindness in this book. An unusual aspect of the book is the fact that the Author uses Death as the narrator but it is done in such a gentle way that one can more easily accept the horrors of reality. I greatly enjoyed this book.
 An intriguing read. It began rather hard to follow and seemed a bit chaotic, but it soon came together as the characters and setting developed. The piece is apt to draw the reader in with its 'story within a story' style and subtexts. The characters are painted in such a way that they seem more like acquaintances than characters. But the real cleverness of the story is that as a narrative, there is a slowly developing and subtle character play by the narrator himself, who is never named. By the story's end you are very much attached to the main Character, Liesel whose story this is and the narrator, who tells the story teller's story.<br/>Nicely done. I'd read another Zusak book. And I guess I should now see the movie for the fun of it.
 How can one adequately talk about a book narrated by death itself? Having just finished the book, I'm still feeling a mixture of sadness and happiness.  I will have to revisit this after I sort my emotions out.<br/><br/>The movie is out on November 27...one reviewer called it a five handkerchief movie.  Read the book before the movie comes out.<br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/The-Book-Thief-Enhanced-Movie-Tie-in-Edition/dp/B00GCE3TCE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Book Thief: Enhanced Movie Tie-in Edition</a>
 Many people today are in denial of the events that occurred in Germany before and during WW 2. A stark reminder of those days woven into a well written story.
 This was a wdonerfully written book that I could hardly put down, anxious to read further.  Very sad though a lot of truth as we know the history of their experiences.  I would recommend it as "needed" reading to those who need a history lesson as we know little today of what happened during those years.  Also, a wonderful lesson in the importance of books as well as the importance of history.
 To you that I am avid reader is putting it lightly. I absolutely love to read. The only reason I decided to read this book is because of how many great reviews. For me, it was hard at first to get into it. The way they present the story is very different. Once you get passed that, it reaches right into your soul. This will definitely will be a reread for me. My heart will carry this story forever.
 I took my time reading this novel as it was written so differently from any other book I've read of the era of Hitler's Germany . It wouldn't be good for a purest to read as their is some swearing in the story . The bounds of friendship and love that grow in Liesel's relationships are intriguing . The word pictures painted by this author will remain with me for years to come , I'm sure .
 I must admit, it took me a while to get used to reading the format of The Book Thief.  It is the first novel that I have ever read that is narrated by Death himself.  Quite the ambitious task I think to have Death your narrator but in this case, Zusak succeeds brilliantly.  This is the best book about the holocaust I have ever read.<br/><br/>Death is an important theme and character in the novel.  He tells us this story in a startlingly off hand, objective and unsympathetic way.  The novel goes from both sad to satirically humorous. The author took a big risk considering a weighty subject matter as vast and deep as the holocaust.  But it wisely does not focus on the holocaust itself, but rather how some German people were affected by it. So many books have been written about this event but The Book Thief puts its own unique spin on it.  It truly is unforgettable.<br/><br/>The prose is sustained, brilliant, and luminous and perhaps most of all haunting, page after page, sentence after sentence.<br/><br/>The way the story is told isn't designed to move one to tears, but I always felt something strong while reading The Book Thief, like a current of electricity moving through me as I devoured the pages.  Don't be fooled by the length of The Book Thief, it races by at an alarming pace.<br/><br/>The plot itself is rather simple, focusing more on thoughts and characters and not so much on events.  A young girl is abandoned by her mother and loses her brother tragically at the beginning of the story and goes to live with her new foster family.<br/><br/>Her foster dad is an accordion player and her foster mother is a ferocious and mean spirited maid in stark contrast to the kindness of the foster father.  She moves into this home at age 11 and the story unfolds over a three year period during World War II in Germany.  This really isn't a story focusing on the holocaust though, even though the family later hides a Jew in their basement for a stretch of time.<br/><br/>This is more of a story about how poorer Germans reacted to Hitler and what was going on around them at the time.  The novel focuses on a particular poor street in Germany and the neighbors and residents of that street.  This young girl is the centerpiece of the story and she begins to steal books during a time when books were banned and book burning was common.<br/><br/>Over time she will gather a modest collection of these books. She makes some close friends, two boys, on her street.  We get to know them quite well along with the Mayor's wife who develops a distant, interesting relationship with this girl.<br/><br/>Because the story is told by Death, you can't help but feel the impending gloom in the air especially during this fragile war time period.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is an important book, and one that flows much like poetry and has a calm melancholy confidence about it. It carries an ability to remain extraordinary despite on the surface a rather ordinary story. The story is all about the characters and I won't give anything away but when you remember who the storyteller is you can't expect a nice and rosy ending.  The characters are vivid and real.<br/><br/>The ideas and characters are what make this book a masterpiece not the story.  It is unlike anything you will ever read, a book flowing with both beauty and sadness and a haunting ending that will stay with you long after the last page is turned, a true quality of a great and memorable book.  The Book Thief is one of the best books I have ever read.<br/><br/>Grade: A
 i have just finished reading this book and I am left with a sense that somehow, I shared Liesel's hopes, dreams, and sorrows along the way.  As she discovered how to read through the giving heart of he Papa, she saw how much "the words" impacted others and herself. To me, words are like a beautiful painting into the soul, unveiling to others , the story to be told. As long as there are words and writers to share their stories , we can never be bored.. This is a beautiful read told in the person of Death himself. I am the daughter of an English child that lived through almost nightly bombings. I have heard similar stories from her so therefore I think the story, though fiction,  accurately represents an era gone by. The ending made the story worth the heartache.
 I thought this book was a wonderful read!  I liked the way the narration was introduced, the concept for the narration, and its continuation throughout the story.  The book is based on historical data, which keeps the reader focused on events during that time frame and didn't seem overly subjective either way.  The book is rated for young adults - I enjoyed it very much and it kept my interest until the end.  I'm way past being a "young adult".
 I will remember this book forever. It was confusing and exhilarating and was unexpectedly fresh. Took me the longest time to understand the narrator.
 I read this story because a friend told me the movie was coming out and I always want to read the "real" story before seeing a movie.  After reading this book, however, I have no desire to see the movie.  The movie could not possibly live up the beautiful story told in the pages of this book.  I haven't been so moved by a story or by the beauty of the prose with which the story was told in a long, long time.  The words on the page are like the brush strokes of an artist.  I had to read and re-read paragraphs just to soak them in.  And then there were pages I had to turn quickly because the story was gripping.  I want to read this book again.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good story and who appreciates the artistry of good writing.
 I learned of this book from the movie trailer and knew right away that I wanted to read it. I've never read a book written in the style as this one was written. I felt like I was right there with all of the characters - through the good, but unfortunately mostly the bad. As others have said - there are times you find yourself laughing, and yet this story is such a sad, tragic time in our world's history. Highly, highly recommend, and I will definitely see the movie.
 I adored this book. It made me laugh, cry, and think. Set during World War 2 in Germany, this is not your average Holocaust tale. The narrator is none other than Death himself, which fits the story nicely. It was beautifully written and the further you get into it, the harder it is to put down. The characters were great, Liesel is now one of my favorite protagonists plus her papa, Rosa, Rudy, and especially Max.<br/>Warning: This is one heartbreaking story but it is worth it.
 Just finished the book. I can't put into words how much I've enjoyed reading it. This book will have you smiling and crying at its sheer beauty and radiance. I'm just so choked up I cannot put into words how wonderful  this book is. The author did a fabulous job taking you on an emotional rollercoaster ride, filled with quiet smiles, tears, simple joys, laughter, despair that leaves you with a lump in the back of your throat. This book is a gem.
 I read this book in preparation for seeing the movie, but got caught up in the book itself.  The movie afterwards was OK, but nothing like the book.  A very enjoyable read.  I especially liked the narrator and his point of view and can understand why this seems to be a universally popular book, pulling on our heartstrings as it does.  I'm sure there are already thousands of reviews on The Book Thief, but just my 2 cents worth for a very worthy story.
 Wonderful and heart wrenching historical fiction told through a very interesting narrator. The author weaves a very beautiful story that lands in a place that leaves you feeling satisfied. I would fully recommend this book.
 What an amazing well-written book.  I won’t go into the story line as others have so not necessary.  I encourage everyone to read. This is one of the best books I have read.
 Used this book - both the paper and audio versions - when teaching WWII to my kids.  Fantastic story, very engaging.  Learned a lot about history, but also about the power of words, honor, friendship, love and sacrifice.  It prompted deep discussions.  One of the best books we have read in a long time.  The audio version is one of the best we have ever heard and we've heard a lot.<br/><br/>Loved it!  Loved it!  Loved it!  5 EXTRA BIG STARS!
 I wept at this soulful story of love and loss. Death's forays so poignantly told, the heroine's young struggles mesh with those of her families, friends, neighbors and the omnipresent enemies of humanity. I will read this again and again to revel in the majestic symbolism. Bravo!
 I saw the movie before I read the book (usually I do that the other way around) but this time I'm glad I saw the movie first, I may not have picked up on certain aspects had I not. That being said I love them both, the movie was so good I watched it twice, I've since bought it. The book is a lot longer than the movie, I'm about 3/4ths the way done and just as enthralled as I was originally.
 I’ll admit, I wasn’t able to immediately immerse myself in this book. With all the recommendations and high ratings I chose to continue, and I’m glad I did. While the story was gradually built up, it contained several heart-wrenching moments and the ending made me cry. While some parts of the book were difficult to maintain interest in, overall this was a fairly decent WWII fiction novel.
 At first I was very hesitant to read this book. In fact the only reason why I picked it up is because I had to for my English class. I just finished this book. It made me happy, made me laugh, made me think more about myself and my own life, and ultimately, it made me cry. I will not give anything away because that wouldn't be fair to you. You must read this book for yourself and draw your own conclusions from it. I will say that I have never appreciated a book more. I absolutely loved it. I will read it again and again. My children will read it. My children's children will read it. This book is timeless. Please I beg you to read it.
 I love to read, I read all the time and can't count how many books I've actually read. This particular book? Was absolutely amazing. The thing about this book was that there were no surprises really, the narrator (Death), told you exactly what and when things would happen. There was no typical climax, if you ask me, and yet, I loved everything about this book. The writing style took a little bit to get used to but after I got used to it, it became much easier. This was a page turner for me and made me smile, laugh and tear up a bit in the end. I really wish the maybe the two main characters could have ended up together but then again it probably wasn't realistic to hope that. This book FELT real, like I was watching everything play out before my eyes, like I could have been IN Nazi Germany while this was being written. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something different, something beautiful.
 It is, of course, a dark and disturbing subject -- but the point-of-view and the writing are incredible. Of course the movie doesn't do the story justice. It was a big book condensed into a movie script that had to be a quarter of the size. It is the little details of a child trying to live normally in times that were anything but normal. You want to take the little girl's innocence and protect it, but no one can. I read a lot of books. I like most of them and love only a few. I love this one.
 If I could give this book 10 stars I would!!!! Most amazingly beautiful book I have ever read and I am Old!! Could not put it down and now I can't find anything to come close to comparing....other books will be a disappointment.
 If this is considered YA, then this is incredible work.  This is a great read for anyone.
 The first several pages are hard to get through, and I almost gave up, but am glad I did not.<br/><br/>Zusak is a very gifted writer, although his style in this book is quite unconventional. He is quite the master of foreshadow and emotion based descriptives.<br/><br/>The story itself is captivating, but extremely sad - heart wrenching in fact. If you are looking for a feel good story, this is not it.<br/><br/>Overall, it is certainly worth reading.
 This book is extraordinary. The title refers to Leisel, the child whose life in Munich during WWII is depicted. Her life is described with empathy and I came to love this fictional child. The contrasts between her inner beauty and the horrors of life as the war gradually took over her existence are exquisitely told. The narrator of the story is the personification of Death. The effect is intense and devastating. A book that I will never forget.
 As you read it you think about the events of a war and how they touch lives.  I read this book with such earnest and couldn't finish it fast enough as I wanted to know what happened next with each character.  The author has the ability to take a tragic situation make you feel like you are right in the midst of all the chaos and beauty of humanity.  This is an excellent story that I highly recommend others to read.  It will stay with you for a long time.
 I cannot remember where I first heard about this book, but when I checked it out at the bookstore, I could not get past the first couple of pages.  When I saw the trailer for the upcoming movie, which intrigued me, I decided to give it another chance, and I am glad I did.  The author has a unique style, which I guess is not for everyone, but I liked it--could not wait to get back to it when I reluctantly had to eat or sleep.
 The story provided a totally different perspective of life in Germany during World War II.  It showed the humanness of Hans and Rosa despite the ugly selfishness and hatred of Hitler, their leader.  The contrast between the empathy of Hans for Liesel and the rough degrading treatment by Rosa made one wonder how an orphaned young girl could survive in this household.<br/><br/>The story of Rudy and his friendship with Liesel was both humorous and an example of true friendship between two youths without a romantic basis for that friendship.  The empathy of Liesel for Max demonstrated that humans can do good despite the political examples of the German leaders who were examples of the worst kind of treatment of fellow human beings.<br/><br/>The book made you recognize that even in the worst of circumstances good can prevail.<br/><br/>The one criticism of the book that I have is that is spent too much time on the stories of Liesel and Rudy's stealing food.
 This book is marketed for younger adults but I think it is appropriate for all ages.  The theme is strong, and the story line is very touching as it is written from the perspective of a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany.  Violence, hardship, and terror are all tactfully included in this book so the reader is neither offended nor frightened off.  There is also a generous dose of childhood humor and frolic, enough to remind the reader that good things did exist in such a notorious time and place.
 This book had me hooked as soon as I started reading.  I love that death is the narrator.  What an unusual point of view!  My favorite relationships were the ones between Leisel and Rudy and Leisel and Hans.  My book club all loved this book.  We also liked how it told us what happened to all the characters, even the minor characters.  I could picture the town and all the inhabitants in my mind.  Great book.  I highly recommend it.
 We just love the way Markus Zusak writes.  He has wonderful and surprising images that give a charming reality to his story, even though the topic is a grim one.  We saw the movie last year, and it was great, but the book surpasses that by far.  I was so sorry when it ended that I'm sure I'll read it again soon, and am also looking at his other books.  We enjoyed "I am the Messanger" very much and I gave it to friends as Xmas gifts.  Keep on writing, Markus!<br/>Donna Vaquer
 I couldn't put the book down. It was very interesting to find out how the Nazi's back in the 1930's and 1940's and how the war started out.<br/>How they thought Jews were bad people. I don't think of it that way but I guess back then they did.<br/>I read the book after watching the movie and the book had a lot more detail then the movie did and explained a lot about what was going on in the movie... I would recommend this book.
 Narrated by Death, in this beautiful told tale the Grim Reaper, has a gentle, thoughtful side. This story is lovingly and wonderfully told with fabulous, believable characters you root for, fall in love with, hold your breath for and when they die, you cry and cry and cry. A poignant tale of growing up under the iron fisted rein of Nazi Germany. A quirkily written story about compassion, the depth of the human heart, love, keeping promises, loss, and the immense power of words.
 Usually, I am skeptical when I hear that everyone else likes a book or movie. I can't help to feel that it's being blown out of proportion and that it just can't be that good. This book is quite the exception.<br/><br/>Narrated by Death, this unique book explores many deep themes including death and dying (no surprise), the power of words, and the beauty of a good friendship. Liesel is a very well developed, three dimensional character, and the supporting characters only add to the amazing story. This book is different from other World-War II era novels, as it takes the view point of a German child. Very little is mentioned about the horrors of the Holocaust, but the book instead focuses on the average German during the war and also brings up several good questions, such as 'Was it right for the Allies to bomb civilians?'<br/><br/>Zusak proves to be a master of symbolism and metaphors - even the cover of the book (falling dominoes) symbolizes something far more treacherous. I've read this book three times, and pick up on something new every time I read it. It is by far the best book I have ever read, and I recommend it to anyone.<br/><br/>Please don't skip over this book because it is labeled as 'young adult.' Just because the main character is a young girl doesn't mean only young girls can read this book. I think anyone, any age could enjoy this book; however, I think people over the age of 14 or 15 would get the most out of it.<br/><br/>Can't wait to see the movie!! (comes out in 2010)
 Zusak, an Australian writer who grew up hearing stories of the Nazi years from his parents, has crafted a tale that focuses on the experience of Liesel and Rudy from their pre-teen years through early adolescence.  He does this, however, without minimizing the horrors that are part of the history of the era.  Liesel steals her first book--a gravedigger's manual--on the day her younger brother dies while the two of them are being taken by their mother to stay with foster parents outside Munich. We get only tantalizing hints about the reasons for the transfer, but it apparently has to do with communist sympathies (clearly on the part of their father, and possibly on the part of their mother as well).  We forget about that quickly, however, as Liesel gradually becomes part of the life of the poorer side of Molching, and particularly Himmel Street, where she lives with Hans and Rosa Hubermann.  Rosa is a grumpy, harsh woman who is constantly bad-mouthing both Hans and Liesel, though in the end we find that she has a soft heart and is dedicated to her husband and foster daughter.  Hans is a kindly house painter who plays the accordion and teaches Liesel to read.  The girl's series of book thefts--from her brother's graveside, from a Nazi book-burning, and most frequently from the library of the mayor's wife (often with the latter's connivance)--form the skeleton of the story.  On this frame, Zusak builds a story that is rich with unexpected imagery which serves to accentuate the emotional impact of the events.  Much of the character of Hans and Rosa (and Liesel) is revealed when they take in Max Vandenburg, a Jew from Stuttgart whose father knew Hans when they were soldiers together in World War I.  They hide Max in their basement, where he and Liesel develop a relationship that both complements and differs from her relationships with her foster parents.  Events unfold toward a conclusion that is perhaps inevitable given the historical events, but is painful nevertheless.  Zusak uses Death as the narrator, allowing him an omniscience that allows the novel at times to take a philosophical approach unavailable to any of its characters.  Death itself, however, is more than just a voice telling the story.  He is a character himself, trying to understand humans even as he carries their souls away from their lifeless and often shattered bodies.  I enjoyed the book very much.  The story itself is engaging and powerful, and Zusak has a knack for using unexpected juxtapositions of words, finding unique images, and effectively deploying small details in memorable ways.  His writing style is unlike any I have read, and while in some authors an unusual style can be annoying, calling attention to the style itself rather than the story, here it worked to set a tone that was somehow fitting for both the somberness of the overarching events and the emotional intensity of the particular experiences of Liesel Meminger and those around her.
 Moving and beautifully told tale from the point of view of death himself...of a young girl caught up in the horror of Nazi Germany, and of the power of words
 I enjoyed finding the "third person" narrative was actually DEATH.  Death's perspective on war and his antipathy towards the lives he gathered was unique, and weirdly comforting.<br/>Also, the true to life resolution and non resolution was something I have often thought about when it comes to people missing from families, especially during wartime.<br/>Want to think about life and death?  Read this and take the time to ponder.
 Read this book.  Read it if you love words.  Read it if you love writing.  Read it if you want a special take on a topic where there are so many great works already.  Read it if you want to become a writer and want to learn how someone can still take a novel and break some traditional rules.  Read it.<br/><br/>I waited a long time to read it because it seemed trendy, and actually finished it on a train going through Germany....was worth every penny and every page, and I should have read it sooner.
 It's rare for me to find a book that can move me the way this one did. I wanted to read this book before seeing the film and I'm glad I did. A film cannot fully translate the writers intent, but if the film even comes close, it will be a good movie. Now I'll know what's coming so I can better control my emotions in the theater. A great read for any age and a great learning experience for younger people that may not be very familiar with the history of Nazi Germany.
 Having read a lot of holocaust literature I don't often read one from the point of view of the German citizens who were often victims as well. Hitler and the Nazi party destroyed so much in such a short time. Written from the point of view of Death, the book does not excuse or condone behavior during that horrific time, it simple records it. The reader is left to make the judgement.
 I finished this book just as the clock struck midnight, signalling the start of my birthday. I was left feeling a profound sense of loss, because 1) I couldn't believe the story has ended and I had to bid goodbye to Liesel, and 2) The ending chapters made me sad. Even though the narrator, Death, had already foreshadowed the ending earlier in the story, I'd always wanted to believe something different would happen for the characters.<br/><br/>A great story, in my opinion, is one that manages to touch you on an emotional level and provokes you into asking questions. The Book Thief is one such story. Set in Nazi Germany, there was never a sense of security given to you as a reader while you "watch" the life of Liesel unfolding. As Death narrates the story, you'll question the transience of life, of living the best life you can despite the circumstances, of warmth, of friendships and love, of the power of relationships, and what it means to be brave.
 Please do not be discouraged to read this book because it's labeled Young Adult.  It is a very great read, told from the perspective of Death during Nazi Germany.  It's interesting to read from the point of view of a "Nazi" family during this time in history.  Great character development - you grow to really care for these people and their relationships with each other (especially Papa and Rudy).  The author forshadows in such a way that tells what's going to happen, but doesn't take away or ruin the story.  This is a book that is hard to put down once it's started.
 The "Book Thief", once the reader understood and came to grips with who was telling the story, was a very unique depiction of this time and place in history.  I found it to be a very well written period piece with lovable characters to whom I made strong connections.  Some readers may find this book to be long and somewhat tedious.  I loved the book and suggest it to anyone who has a soft spot spot in their heart for the reality of the German poor and the Jews during World War II.
 This book was hard to read for the first few pages, but then you get caught up in the story and it is hard to put it down.  There is an amazing set of characters.  The story takes you into the heart of Germany and  World War Two.  You are left with a very personal view of war and its affect on those involved.  When you are finished reading, you feel that you know the horrors of war in a very personal way.
 This book...must read. You will fall in love with the characters and such a great way of telling Lisell’s story!
 I have never read a book where every word on every page is necessary to the whole story. Poignant, beautiful, devastatingly heart-wrenching, magnificently crafted; all words that attempt to describe this incredible book. Markus Susan is a most gifted writer. I was captivated by its depth and feeling. I don't often cry while reading a book, but I often found myself reading through tears. I will not forget this story and I will continue to be touched by both the humanity and inhumanity in all of us.
 The writing is spectacular, which is amazing given that it had to be translated into English. I often stopped at the metaphors to ponder how the author created them. Even though this book has been characterized as an "adolescent" book, I believe adults will enjoy it tremendously. Don't just watch the new movie out, which is good, but veers from some of the book's story lines.<br/>I have not rated a book with a 5 until now.
 This book is a definite page turner and keeps you engaged the whole time. While the subject is grim, and is especially depressing knowing it's based on history and these kinds of things really happened, it is somehow still optimistic and lighthearted in a way, through the eyes of this little girl. I saw the movie as well and of course was making comparisons in my head (the book is better), I was glad I had read the book first as I think it makes more sense. Definitely recommend for anyone wanting to see the movie. :)
 This book can be a real eye opener to many who read this book, particularly our younger generation. The kids who read this book will be able to see how extreme growing up under different circumstances can be. And at the same time understanding that happiness or satisfaction isn't necessarily based on expensive material things.
 I just finished The Book Thief 2 days ago. It took me FOREVER to finish it, and I really forced myself to get through to the end.<br/>I found the narrator (Death) far too removed from the story, far too indifferent. What may be an interesting literary technique, to me, made the book almost unpalatable. I resented the narrator and even more so when Death thought to make shocking comments about how humans died, etc... I found the narration grim and repulsive. And it was difficult to me to identify or even love any of the characters, because the narration kept me very distant from them.<br/>Besides the narration, even though I could see that the author was trying to write in a poetic manner (I did find a few good quotes to highlight), I couldn't appreciate this because the pace of the story was too slow (and the technique of foreshadowing what happens next ruined it even more). I think this is a book for people who like really slow unfolding books and who like to know the end before the beginning (I do know a few book lovers who actually like reading like this. But not me!)<br/>In general, I felt hugely disappointed. I had so looked forward to reading this book, after all the hype around it (and the rave reviews), and I found it to be written for literary critiques, rather than for normal readers. It's the first time I don't agree with the majority of reviewers on a book and it really confounds me! To people who want to read a good historical novel on World War 2, try All The Light We Cannot See instead. Now THAT is a brilliant book in many ways, and I couldn't put it down.<br/>Note: I'd just like to clarify that I read the normal Kindle version (not the enhanced one) which apparently is no longer available, though I doubt the enhanced version would have enhanced the experience enough to change my review.
 There are many stories within this one story and all of them are captivating.  From the persona of Death, the narrator, to the hidden kindness of those who people the book they are all more interesting than macabre.  I read Anne Frank when I was very young and it scarred me since - have never seen Titanic or other historic catastrophic movies since, but this book just captivated me. As an aged R.N., I have seen the soul leave the body many times and I will never look at Death the same way again.
 I am one of those "the book is always better" folks. To me, it's always more interesting to see the film after having read the book. The most interesting and unique aspect of this novel, aside from the wonderful character development and plot, is the point of view of the narrator. No spoiler alert here -- you'll have to read it for yourself and make up your own mind. The best book I've read this year, so far. Suitable for teen readers &amp; highly recommended for history buffs.
 What a wonderful read, such a deep feeling of humanity. It was a brilliant artifice to have a narrator, and what a narrator!  There are not many boos that reduce me to tears by the end, but this one did. My 10 year old granddaughter avows that it's the best book she has ever read. I wouldn't argue with her, it's a book written with deep understanding of the human condition. It has everything, a few laughs among the ashes of mans inhumanity.
 This book affected me deeply. It was a window into the horrible conditions the Nazis put their own countrymen. They tortured them too.Taking away books was the ultimate mind control.The young girl knew she must have books to survive.I was awed by  the courage she had to risk her life so she could read. I wish all our young people could read this book and imagine a life without books, tv, ipads  cell phones.I suffered with her. She had so little. I read this a while ago so I bought it for my sister to read.
 This is a book I read ages ago it seems, and bought for my kindle since I borrowed the other from the library (a what?).  This book is sweet, sad, hopeful and heartbreaking all in one.  You have war through the eyes of a child and "death" .  I know this sounds far fetched, but this is wonderfully written.  This book is about the human spirit in the most difficult times, and how beautiful that spirit can be- regardless of the horrors.
 For the first time in my life I fininshed a book and immediately started rereading it.  What a story Mr Zusak  has  shared with his audience.  Each character came to life with such clarity I felt like i was there with them all.  What a sad time in human history so many poeple misguided to torture innocent people .  But, there were some shinning examples of people who made their own path and refused to follow a leader they knew was wrong and risked their own lives to help.
 We all have read and watched and wondered about the people and events during the time of war with an inordinate amount of study and analysis done about the second world war. Never have I read such a masterpiece as this book is. A totally different and powerful perspective that captured my attention so,that I read it in one afternoon. The unique point of view of the narrator will take your breath away.
 Humanity. In the human animal the line between compassion and the final solution is thin as the thread that separates life from death. This novel holds a mirror before the reader and reflects back all that is humanity: Love and hate. Savagery and tenderness. Beauty and brutality. In Zusak's work, the human enigma collides like a cold whip upon a baby soft cheek. Saddening. Maddening. Courageous. Inspiring. A book that every human should be required to read...over and over and over until he or she gets it right.
 I read the book because I knew it had been turned into a movie.  When I started it, it was just after being in a car accident that I could have died in.  I am thankful to God for His protection and for this book.  It is about the Second World War, the atrocities of Hitler, death, and life.  It is a book I recommend every one to read. Words can bring life or death, healing or pain, sorrow or joy, love or hate.  That's what this book really is about.
 This was en excellent book, from the beginning to the end. The little girl you fall in love from the first page and then you life her life as if you were there with her. This is an excellent book of a book lover, that even though tough things are happening around her , the love she has for books, saves her from becoming a sad person. You will enjoy the book, it is so good.
 One of if not my favorite book. If you have seen the movie trust me it doesn't do the book justice. Beautifully written, well worded and wonderful imagery and metaphors. Be prepared to cry and not just once. It is one of those books where when you finish you will just sit there for a bit and reflect. Makes you really appreciate many things and get angry at others.
 I was disappointed with the quality of the book so he issued me a refund. It’s nice to see niceness today.<br/>Thank you
 An amazingly written novel of an amazingly horrific time in history.  Once the narrator's identity was determined, the depth of the author's words multiplied.  Highly recommended novel for teaching author's style, though the content would best serve students on a secondary level.
 This is a book that will take you inside of its pages and never let you go. You will shiver in the cold, ache from despair, smell the smoke, and stand in awe at the destruction.  Just when you are not sure if your gut can take anymore, you will find hope..hope in a person, a moment, a thought. This is true literature at its best.
 I finished this book yesterday afternoon while on a vacation; even gave up time walking on the beach to read this wonderful story!  There is no need to review ths story line, as it has been done sufficiently by previous commentary.  Although I probably wouldn't have picked up this book myself, it was a book club selection, and quite frankly, I was hooked after the first few pages.  The writing is beautiful, almost poetic, and the characters are well defined.  Who would think that a story narrated by Death, told in the time of Nazi Germany, would hold so much hope, bravery, and courage?  Yes, there is plenty of sadness, loss, grief, and destruction, but through it all, a tale of the beauty of the human spirit, goodness, and love.  I will recommend this book to everyone, and it is one of the few books I will reread.  It will haunt me for a long time....
 I bought this book mainly out of curiosity, because it had gotten a lot of publicity, what with the movie coming out and all.  The Soul<br/>Gatherer is the narrator, and that's kind of spooky - but in a way it's comforting too.  It's a time in history that was just awful, and it's told from the German side, which was a switch.  Well done, and very touching.  I recommend it.
 As I read through this book, I remembered my English professor, Sharon Sellers, talking about authors who wrote so that the words described perfectly the characters' actions. This is one of those writers, wielding lovely descriptive verbs and metaphors to tell the story. How else do you describe a tall lemon haired boy who colored himself black as black as coal... with coal... in Nazi Germany and ran track thinking of himself as Jessie Owens?
 I guess I was disappointed because I anticipated this would be a great book.  I finished it because I bought it but if I had borrowed this book from the library I would have quit reading after the first few chapters and took it back. Just a little too blah for me.
 I love this book. The POV is awesome and the story is different than most books set in this time period.
 My 16 year old daughter was reading this book for school and recommended I read it. Once I picked it up, I had trouble putting it down, often staying up much later than I should have. A very touching story.
 I first read this as a library book, and ended up buying a Kindle version to re-read because it was so good! I also recently watched the movie, which is a great adaptation. Initially I found this book a little difficult to get into. I thought the way the narrator and the story jumped back and forth was too confusing and I found it hard to read. However, once I got the hang of the book I couldn't put it down! Definitely worth hanging in there.
 I saw the movie before reading the book. I was worried that that might be a problem as usually I read the book first before seeing the movie. In this case I think that seeing the movie 1st was good and help me get more of the book. I would recommend this book to any serious student of the second World War.
 I've read many books about the Holocaust and actually already seen the movie made from this one, but was so rewarded by this read.  Not only are the characters richly drawn, the story one that will stay with you, but the author's choice in narration genius.  Having death itself tell the story of Liesel ironically gives us glimpses of the best of humanity in a time in our history full of the worst.  A surprise, and a book that will stay with me a long time.
 The Book Thief was a compelling read.  While certainly in a very sad time for our planet's history, Markus Zusak's descriptions were a feast for creating every flavor and texture of a scene and emotion.  At first a little difficult to adjust to the writer's style, but I so enjoyed it's the richness; it's creative and unusual wordsmith-ing, I couldn't put it down.<br/><br/>Others can handle the plot description... I highly recommend it!
 I had heard great things about this book but never read it. Finally I decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did. The writing in this book is u like anything I've read. It is vivid in the language and I feel like I lived through all of these experiences. The narrator is basically the grim reaper and it makes for a very unique perspective.<br/><br/>I HIGHLY recommend this book. I'm not going to lie- the last 30 pages had me sobbing. So heart touching and amazes me how relevant much of the underlying story is to today's world. Very very well written.
 I really enjoyed The Book Thief, especially the history in it. It really stuck out in my mind that not just the Jews were afraid. So many people were trapped basically in their own homes. They couldn't speak out against what was going g on around them.  It's a wonderfully written book, with characters that you will fall in love with. Rudy, Max and Papa are heros of the old fashioned kind, men with huge loving hearts. I couldn't help but fall in love with Mama, she's a no nonsense kind of person, but would have laid her life on the line for those she loved. The narrator was the biggest surprise. I will no longer think of him as dark and mysterious. Of course then there is Liesel. She will stay with you, even when you've put the book down. You will think of her during your working hours, while you are shopping, and even when you lay your head on your pillow to sleep. You will worry for her and want to make it better. She will be like your own child. The Book Thief is also a heart thief.
 This book is a definite must read. I had watched the movie before starting this book, but I was not disappointed in reading the book afterwards,  because there was so much to the story that movies don't always fit into their films. This was a great story and, I think, many would agree that watching the movie and then reading the book will not disappoint.
 A powerfully thoughtful book, written with eyes that look deeply into the human heart.  I was touched by the author's ability to tell this story with such insight into human emotions.  One phrase that especially gave me pause was, and I quote "Nazi Germany became a nation of farmed thoughts planted throughout the land."  When we wonder how a people could allow cruelty of this magnitude, we are reminded that it seeps slowly into the life of a nation.  This should be a must read for our younger generation, and a gratifying read for all who enter its pages.<br/>Jane Hanson
 Amazing stuff, I really loved this book!<br/><br/>The characters are unforgettable, a profoundly moving story for anyone to read!<br/><br/>This was the 1st novel of Markus Zusak that I have ever heard of or read, but it was well worth it.<br/><br/>Liesel is one character that I will never forget from a book!<br/><br/>Hans Hubermann, Max Vandenburg, Rudy Steiner all truly touching characters, brought to life vividly by Zusak.<br/><br/>The writing is amazing, the message about the power of words is absolutely true...<br/><br/>Highly recommended book!!
 A little girl and her love for remembrance come alive in this well written novel historically researched novel of WWII.
 The thing I lived most about this book was, in retrospect, the slow start and seemingly strange narrative point of view.  I haven't been told a story by death before and the idea seemed outlandish at first.  As time went on I began to enjoy that strait and honest voice and the intimate details only it could only l know.  Stories of the war are legion, however this one brought some newness and freshness to a topic very well covered.  The characters live and breathe, more vivid and colorful than one can imagine.  This is a great read.  Enjoy.  CW
 Given the world today this is an excellent read and an emotional one. The story will wrench even the coldest heart<br/>and make you yearn for a day when all would love their fellow man.
 I wanted to give it five stars then thought of other books I have read over the years. No books are so perfect that they receive five stars. This book deserves to be read by many now and in years to come. It relates pure emotion at the reader and breaks away any ideas you might have thought to change the story.<br/>I will read more of Markus Zusak's writings and see if his words continue creep under my skin, in my heart and<br/>remain lasting.
 A brilliant read. Iives up to the great reviews.  Poignant &amp; sad yet full of hope too. Incredibly original with Death as the narrator. You really find yourself connecting with him (Death) as well as with the characters about whom he is narrating. I am sure this Death is a him, even though I don't think it's ever said, but he reads like a 'him'.<br/><br/>Read this book; just not too close to reading another holocaust/WWII book. I have read 3 this year including The Lost Wife &amp; The Hare with Amber Eyes , and it really is a bit much.
 I posted this over a year ago...and for some reason, it came up a one star review! I tried to edit it, but one star was locked in. Thanks to a suggestion to delete the original review and repost another, I can give this book the rating it deserves.<br/><br/>One of our reading group members brought this book to a meeting as a possible selection for the month. It looked interesting...and since none of us had heard of it or knew the author, we thought what the heck, we'll give it a try. Every one of us loved it. It was the book I was waiting for.<br/><br/>We all questioned why it was classified a young adult book. Other than being a story about a young girl, and being a relatively "easy read", there was nothing childish about it. The content was so rich and the story line was often so intense we all felt young adults would not have enough of life's experiences to appreciate it the way we all did. I wonder how many adults will overlook this novel as a result, and miss out on the joy of reading such a wonderful book.<br/><br/>With the character Death narrating the story, it put a new perspective on a story we have all heard many times...Death's commentaries throughout the book were not only informative, but added nice rest breaks from the intensity of the story line.<br/><br/>I love reading a book whose characters are so well developed that I escape to a different time, a different place. Reading Zusak's novel, I truly felt a part of this intimate community. It was a marvelous book. One of my top ten life time reads...one of the few that I will read again one day.<br/><br/>Addendum: I have recommended this book to probably 25-30 people, and all but one have thanked me for it! Having read it well over a year ago, I truly realize what an unforgettable read it was.
 A group of ladies (all over 65) decided that even though we meet once a month, we needed at least once during the year to read and review a book.  Book thief was suggested, but acknowledged that it was during a depressing time of history.  I thought I would read the book and then get on to more pleasant reading.  I was surprised at what an excellent book this was.  I found the story, completely fascinating, and the point of view of the narrator to be excellent.  I couldn't put it down.  It was a depressing time in Nazi Germany, but a new look at the era.  Great book
 I bought this book because I ran into good reviews over and over again.  I also am interested in the subject matter though I prefer books written by people who actually were there.<br/>I have to admit that I had a very, very hard time getting into the book and was ready to give up on it after about 50 pages into it or so. The first thing which bothered me was the language. I speak German and I could not deal with the amount of swear words repeated over and over and over again.  I have never met a German person, who would talk that way.  And I have never heard that word " Saumensch".<br/>There may be people who swear so much but the social milieu these people lived in did not fit the picture of constantly swearing people without provocation and reason.  I do not like to listen to rap songs for the same reason, though I know that some segments of the population actually talk that way.)<br/>There were other things unbelievable for me:<br/>Only the son of Hans and Rosa Hubermann seems to be a willing Nazi, the rest of the characters just follow out of fear.<br/><br/> The little girl playing soccer with the boys. I am pretty sure that at that time only boys played soccer and would not have allowed a girl to participate.<br/> Also I found the story about Rudy wanting to kiss her at the tender age of nine dubious.  Nowadays kids are sexually more aware earlier, but in 1940?<br/>The foster father Hans was a little bit too perfect for my taste. I mention these two things because it is supposed to be a book for children or teenager.<br/><br/>Making death the narrator was an interesting choice considering the fact that over 50 million people got killed in this war. That guy must have been busy like hell; it is a miracle that he could keep track of the life of a little girl. And I would have preferred if he would have told a little bit more about the incredible amount of people killed.<br/>So far for the criticism.<br/>I did finish the book and the last part was moving and sad but the book left me completely dissatisfied because it gave me no answers. Of course there are always decent people  who will try to do the right thing, even if they endanger themselves or their loved-ones.. But why are there so many who don't???Not one character in this book explains the other side - the Nazi side.  Why is there always such a support for war? Why is it so easy to rally people against one group and completely alienate them from the rest of the population?  Why are we so easily ruled by fear? And why is it possible that some maniacs can run a country???<br/> Why do we not learn from history?  I hate living in a country which is constantly at war and still has the death penalty. But I feel about as helpless against it as the heroine of this book - over sixty years later.I wish there would be a book for children explaining the evil part of human nature.
 This book was recommended by a friend who is an author herself.  She said it was the best book she had ever read and I had to know why. I'm so glad I did.  As a person whose heritage is German, I have always read stories from WWII with tremendous feelings of sadness.  This book weaves a tale that is both heartwrenching and uplifting in the same sentence.  The format was a bit unusual, but added to the mesmerizing effect of the story line.  And the author's unusual use of verbs and adjectives shows his deep love for words.  I will definitely recommend this book to others, and look forward to re-reading it in the not-too-distant future.
 My 12 year old son and I listened to this book together.  We both found the story to be very well told.  The writing style is so different, but so genius.  I believe this book will be read by many for a long time.  It's destined to be a classic.<br/><br/>The characters are so well-developed.  I won't be forgetting them any time soon.  The author makes you want to wrap your arms around them all.
 This book ranks in the "absolutely wonderful" category with me.  It's one of the best books I've ever read, and I read a LOT!!!  It's brilliantly conceived, using "death" as the narrator, and the story is both funny and sad.  Amazing that Markus Zusak could make such a dark subject feel so charming.  I know that seems a contradiction, but I loved the characters!  They made me laugh out loud, and then cry.  It's really worth reading then reading again.
 The Book Thief is easily the best novel I've read this year.  I'm not very adept at writing reviews, and I hate reviews that are nothing more than a synopsis of the book.  I just wanted to say something about this story and how it moved me.  It is surprisingly easy to read despite the fact that the story and characters possess incredible depth.  It's just a really good, well written, emotional story.  The Narrator touched me in a profound way.
 This book is beautifully written. So much love and loss and just enough details to get you hooked. I would have loved to hear more about what happens to Leisel in her adult life but I'm satisfied with what was told to us. Thank you.
 The first time I picked up this book, I must admit that I put it back down. I wasn't so sure about reading  a story narrated by Death. Then I saw the movie, and was gripped by a desire to give it another shot. The atrocities of World War 2 have always caused me to wonder at how hatred could go so far. This book reminded me of human kindness and goodness in the midst of it all. Love always wins in the long run. It's the story of mankind. It's His story too - the story of God....a celebration of Love. And the tender relationships between Liesel and those she encounters make for a certain overriding sweetness. I will definitely pick this one up again!
 Written in plain but insightful language, this novel touches you with a deeply human spirit. You love, hate, hurt, and rejoice for the simple yet complicated life of a little German girl who lives through so much pain but finds humanity in the smallest things. Her story will inspire you to rise above the petty trials of life and see and feel true humanity in all that is around you.
 could hardly put the book down and looked forward to every reading. Liesel the main character, was delightful and perfect as the leading character. Her perceptions were so deeply felt by the reader. The characterization of Germany in World War 2 was frightening especially knowing that such a leader could emerge again. Human  life meant nothing to Hitler and it is so amazing that intelligent people elected and revered him. Excellent book.
 The story is a hard one about hard times.  I was intrigued about  each character.  I wanted to know what happend to whom and when as I met them.  Mr. Zusak made me care about each and everyone of them.  I expected to like the book thief and the father was an immediate lovable character.  However, I did not like the mother until the author slowly moved her from an angry hard woman to a person I understood to have great love for her family and an open loving mind towards the unfortunate. This was done in a meaningful fashion that softened my feelings for her as she unplugged her heart and set it free.  When I try to speak of the Book Thief and mention the subject matter many are put off.  My support lends itself to the story telling . . Markus Zusak's talent for how he represents each participant and style of selecting words to describe or state anything makes this book an amazing read.  I could not put it down.
 When reading the first chapters I almost gave up on The Book Thief. The imagery was unusual and the narrator being death personified was off-putting but I stayed with the book and I'm glad I did. The Book Thief shows great heart and colour in the grey and grim world of living in a poverty stricken area of Nazi Germany in WWII. The book has a lot to say and through the narration and the dialogue says it powerfully. I really wonder if the cinematographer can do justice to the book.
 I had alittle bit of a hard time with who the story was being told by, it was a different angle, but the basic story was well told. I liked hearing about the German home life during the war, and seeing the struggle for the people who just didn't go along with the Nazi way. How terrifying it must have been for the people who hid Jews during that time. I didn't want the story to end when it did. I wanted to hear how she came to have a good life after.
 Insight into what the general population of Germans must have experienced but the overall lack of horror for the treatment and attitudes towards Jews and what was happening around them is more endorsement of the fact that most citizens knew and did nothing. I found the story dark and depressing. Why it has had so much press puzzles me. I don't recommend it as an entertaining read.
 I loved this book! The writing style is unusual and fascinating.  Although the subject matter is heartbreaking, it is also an inspiring and uplifting read.
 This powerful story of the Germans who also suffered in WW II is told by a reliable narrator, Death. Although the structure of the plot is certainly unique, it seems appropriate for the uncertain events of war and for the voice of an eternal observer trying to understand what it means to be mortal. The reader may well wonder who the book thief truly may be. As my son observed, the thief could be Death stealing the pages of our lives.
 One of my all time favorite books.  Starts out slow, and you have to keep reading.  It gets better. Characters are people you connect to and fall in love with.
 A noble attempt to present World War II and the Holocaust to teens.  The writing is mediocre.  The book is overly long for what it is.  The story line isn't believable enough.  The device of making Death the narrator renders the book farcical and undermines its intention to educate a young generation for whom the events and horrors are ancient history.<br/><br/>An example of the ludicrousness to which the book descends when Death is speaking:  "On June 23, 1942, there was a group of French Jews in a German prison, on Polish soil.  …  Please believe me when I tell you that I picked up each soul that day as if it were newly born.  I even kissed a few weary, poisoned cheeks.  I listened to their last, gasping cries.  Their vanishing words.  I watched their love visions and freed them from their fear… They were French, they were Jews, and they were you."<br/><br/>Definitely not suitable for adults.
 I finished the book, and that's about it. The writing was confusing, and I kept on waiting for the plot to make sense. I felt like I read the same thing over and over, with nothing ever happening
 I loved this book. The point of view is interesting and unusual. The author's descriptions are awesome. The characters are multi-layered and very well developed. The book is heart breaking, funny at times and brought me so personally into the lives of these people and this time period that I actually miss them. The enhanced movie tie-in is an added bonus to help set the tone of the book.
 This book is one of the best I have read in a long time. Well written, poignant story that will have you thinking about it long after you have finished. I was recommending this book to friends before I was even half way through it. The point of view is very unique and the characters are well developed. Even with the narrator giving you spoilers of how it ends only adds to the heart wrenching finale. Everyone needs to read this book!
 What a wonderful story of human trials, morals and emotional triumphs set in war tarnished Germany.  The story was beautifully woven - so many inferences and wonderful descriptions.  Characters are well developed and so real...the author did a great job at creating a clever balance between enemies and allies with an underlying message that there are no victors in  war.  Truly a 'must read' masterpiece!
 This is a remarkable book..  Went to a grief counseling session - was sitting next to a librarian.  She and the Counselor begian taking about this book  -so of course had to secure it.  Was unfamiliar with this author, and have now requested all his books.  They were so  impressed, as am I.  It is a remakable book about WWII from the standpoint of  people living in Berlin and other parts of Germany during the war.  But is is not what you would expect.
 I have recommended this book to everyone i know who has a kind and sensitive heart. Most heartfelt book i have read in a long time about a foster girl living with a family who protects a Jew in their shallow basement. The narrator is Death and the writing is exquisite, simple, charming, moving, beautiful. The girl steals books from the Mayor's house, her best friend Rudy would do anything in the world for her for just a kiss. Her foster father is her life, her foster mother is a tyrant who deep inside loves her more than anything. How the force of words (from the Fuhrer) can control you...if you let them. You will not be able to put this book down.
 This book has been an amazing experience to read. Written in a most unique style, it's completely captivating, heartbreaking, endearing, frightening and has touched my heart more profoundly than any other book I've read in a very long time. I'd give it TEN stars if I could. When a book enables the reader to feel the complete spectrum of emotions, there's nothing else to give it but the highest praise. Well done and many thanks to author Marcus Zusak.
 An excellent reading of what the human race is like during WW2 in Nazi Germany. Rarely do we read about the people that lived in Germany during that time. Could you imagine, one minute your neighbor is a friend until the government says he/she is a scourge and needs to be punished?  Then you live in poverty, starving, and being bombed. A fantastic read . You will love it!
 An incredible  story from an unexpected perspective. Death roamed Germany during WWII, stealing souls from Jews and Germans without prejudice. All are equal at the point of death.
 I too was about this girls age at this time of the Second World War.  I too loved reading books and related with her .<br/>Fortunately we lived in the United States of America and I did not have to experience many of the awful things<br/>that she did.<br/>I was entranced with this book, and now would like very much to see the movie and see how they put it all<br/>together
 We had a chance to see the movie, The Book Thief.  It was a little different from the book, but I am at 85 percent of the book on the Kindle.  It is sort of an interesting book, but it is a surprise that Heil Hitler is in the book.  The interaction between Mama and Papa and Rudy and Max with Leisel Meminger.  At the end of the movie, Mama and Papa and Rudy are gone and then the movie ends with Leisel with Max. A big surprise!
 One of the all-time best books ever. One of the few that both my granddaughter and I enjoyed.
 I did not want this book to end and I purposefully delayed reading the ending.  No matter how well a book is written there will always be some sections that you want to skim over until you get to the good parts.  The Book Thief didn't have that.  The pace was just right for me.<br/>  I think every age of reader should know about the activities during World War II.  The Book Thief's narrator gave a different perspective, one that I did not initially understand.  The narrator was very much in the background until it came time to talk about his activities relevant to the story.  How could there be funny happenings during such a bleak time filled with air raids, rationing and pea soup?  Pea soup is funny in itself, which you will realize as you read the story.<br/>  This book is great!  I highly recommend it.
 ...and would suddenly remember and be surprised.  It took me several pages to get into the rhythm of the narration and figure out what was going on, but I soon got it and then couldn't put it down. It is an amazing look at Death as a character and as a player.  It was of course heartwrenchingly sad as are all novels of the holocaust but it is outstandingly lyrical and lovely as well.  I truly loved it.
 I was asked to choose a book to read for a book club in my high school English class, and as soon as I heard the description for this book, I knew I wanted to read it. However, after ordering this book I'd forgotten the premise, and as I started reading I was confused as to who the narrator was. The unusual choice of narrator created an intrigue and I wanted to keep reading. The story flowed pretty well, with just a little backtracking that wasn't annoying, just a little difficult to keep up with. The character development was great and made me feel like I actually knew each character (which made it that much harder to read the ending). I liked that the books gives a perspective on what it was like for both children and adults living in Nazi Germany, Jewish or not. The Book Thief is excellently written; it's a page-turner. I probably wouldn't re-read it, but I rarely do with any book. However, it does leave me wanting more! I really recommend this to anyone 13+ or younger advanced readers. Great read!
 I loved how well the characters developed in the story. Liesel was very shy and unwilling to do much but as she grew more accustomed to the life she became more brave. Hans was not very open at first but as time went by he became very open to Liesel.  Rosa was very mean and inconsiderate to Liesel at first but after a whole she started to love Liesel too. Max was a very amazing character he was shy at first but then became open to Liesel. Rudy was very amazing he was mean to Liesel at first but then became great friends with her and may have even married her if he hadn't of died. All the characters were axing and the storyline was great i loved it even if I could get confused at some parts of the story i wish I could give it a full 5 stars.
 At first glance, the subject matter of this book seems to heavy, too sad. However, the author's creative choice of making death the narrator makes WWII an oddly bearable subject. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of sadness in this book, but the story makes you think more than it makes you cry.<br/><br/>This book is the kind of book you'd want to read over and over again. Highly recommended to anyone interested in the era.
 This is a good test of a great book vs. a good book: remembering the story &amp; the characters long after you have finished reading the book. The Book Thief's author paints vivid pictures of the main characters including it's unusual narrator, 'Death'.<br/>Don't let the first few pages deter you. The opening pages are odd. But then the book launches into the life of a young girl named Liesel who living with foster (sort of) parents in pre-WW II Germany. This is a story written about people who hold onto humanity in spite of being in the midst of inhumane events. There is often dark humor and matter-of-fact telling of incidents that keeps the novel from being 'preachy'. I couldn't put the book down.
 I just can't believe how wonderful this book is. I had been wanting to read for some time now, and now that I have I  can say it is one of my favorite stories. I found myself reading and re-reading so many of the words that Death used to describe how things appeared in his memory to coincide with events in the book. Each character in this book possesses qualities that one can cherish. This is truly a story that touches the soul on so many levels. Highly recommend.
 This book well definitely stay in your memory for a long time, i tell all my friends about this book, people that never used to like to read before have fallen in love with this book and continue to share this book with theri friends, u totally fall in love with the character and u never want this book to end, thats pretty much all i will share, because this book is sooo awesome i dont wanna ruin any part for you.
 Death has a story to tell about something that happened in 1939 Nazi Germany. A story about newly orphaned Liesel Meminger and her new foster parents Hans and Rosa Hubermann. A story about Rudy Steiner, the boy who wants to steal a kiss from her, and Max Vandenburg, the Jew who lives in her basement.<br/><br/>This is one of those books that exceeds expectations by such a degree, I'm left awestruck. This is not what I expected from a book labeled YA. The language in this book is simple yes, which I suppose is for the benefit of the Young Adult, and about a child growing up in Nazi Germany, but the story is complex enough for the Old Adult, with a pile of emotional triggers (code for I cried...a lot).<br/><br/>The story itself, is narrated by Death. That Death would take notice of anything besides ferrying souls between worlds, lends the haunting narrative a hopeful touch. Death takes notice of Liesel Meminger, a nine year old girl and a survivor, who's traveling with her younger brother to meet their new parents. But Liesel's brother never finishes the journey, and so Death begins to haunt Liesel Meminger's footsteps.<br/><br/>Illiterate little Liesel, placed in a class with students much younger than she, covets books above all other things. She takes them when no one's looking, she learns to read them in the basement with her foster father's help. There are moments of happiness for Liesel, learning to read, finding Rudy, her partner in crime, and  sneaking a snowman through the house. Moments of youthful indiscretions and laughter followed by the horror of air raid sirens and bullies and starving men forcibly marched down the street. And while Liesel's fleeting moments of happiness encourage hope, Death never let's you forget how many people are dying while she's learning to read...<br/><br/>And that's the best and the worst part about this book. The happiness. The sadness. Liesel's a child who has  already experienced too much loss, so seeing her happy is a relief followed by page-turning-anxiety in the knowledge that more pain is headed her way. And when bad things start to happen, you can't help but cry at the helplessness of it all. That at the end of the day, Liesel can only keep surviving, keep living, keep trying. That no matter what happens, Death has more to do when the humans go to war...And that He will inevitably come for everyone.<br/><br/>As sad as this book was, and predicted itself to be, the ending was surprising. Liesel was granted some happiness at the end and that made the pain worth suffering.<br/><br/>Any book that can make me feel so much is worthy of 5 stars.
 this book is a must read it can catcher your eyes mind and most of all heart if I had read one book for the rest of my life this could likely be the book why because it's got every thing drama for the man checking for Jews romance for Rudy trouble for stealing relief for Hans sadness for everyone but with leslie there's a felling a felling no-one can explain nor know that felling.
 The Book Thief is an excellent book, filled with the hardships of the war in Germany. Each character is presented as a strong personality with his or her own mission. The thread of love in their relationships leads the reader on an interesting journey. I felt connected to their struggles and personally invested in their stories. It will stir emotions in the reader and leave the reader questioning the lengths people will go to find the truth.
 This is the most impactful book I have ever read. The words. How to sum it up in simple inadequate words? It can’t be done. One must experience it for themselves.
 My high school juniors read I Am the Messenger by Zusak this fall and really loved the book, as I did. It has a lot of meat for discussion, and I love that it is about a believable 19-year-old and his struggles in life, but he is not a victim. He is searching for meaning in his life and does not let life trample over him. He gradually recognizes that he can make a difference, even if he is one average"nobody" in an indifferent world. That recognition is ultimately life affirming and inspiring to him and to the reader, and the ending has an amazing twist. Its uplifting theme about the power of one is what made me come back for The Book Thief, which is an equally inspiring and suspenseful tale involving a young girl living in Nazi Germany just prior to WWII. Once again, Zusak gives the story a twist by making his narrator the voice of death...yes death as he draws the reader into the frightening world of Hitler's deepening threat to Europe and the free world. This is one talented young author.
 Amazing.  The author draws you in and makes you feel such strong emotions at every turn.  The story, the unique style of writing, the even more unique choice of narrator, everything was superb.  I can't believe this was written by someone so young, this is what you would expect of a many times over bestselling 50-60-something author.  I can't wait to read his other works, and excited for what the future holds for Mr. Zusak. What a talent.
 This is a great story. Love, lost and rebirth. Death is the narrator, which I love. The story is told with an eloquence of a master.  It is nice to possibly imagine what life was like from the German perspective during the Natiz reign. The characters come to life in the story and are truly lovable. You will think back on their lives many times after you read this story.
 The author said they are just words, made it sound so simple at that. Words change men.  Words inspire and words condemn.  Words make history. The Book Thief  is not just words.  It is not simple the way the author pulls the story from its pages. It is eloquent,  hopelessly sad, and yet immerses the reader so deeply that when he survives the reading, his first impulse is to read it again.
 This is the perfect read for anyone who loves a riveting story about the beauty &amp; the dark side of humanity. The characters are deeply developed, leaving you mourning, celebrating, &amp; trembling in their fear. Although fiction, the author paints a vivid picture of WW2 Germany that will leave you hopelessly absorbed. Must read for those who like historical fiction!
 Unexpected writer's perspective.  Chilling and stark yet full of hope.  Up and down, my heart leapt and cringed as the story unfolded.  Bless you all.
 The beginning of this novel is subtle and at times difficult to get involved . But as it rolls forwaed it becomes an express train that keeps you on board and captivated mile by mile. The characters are well drawn. throughout this novel there is sadness, joy, hatred and love.. Anyone interesred  in humanity would find this novel a worthwhile reading adventure.
 I thought the story was well written with very engaging characters. I believe the author realizes that readers will find it hard to have any sympathy for non-jewish german citizens during WWII and therefore doesn't try too hard. Max, the character most will sympathize with, is almost like a living ghost but offers the family the opportunity to begin to question what Germany is truly fighting for and the price that all its' people have had to pay. I liked the book very much and felt the story's message was strong enough that I passed it along to my 11 year old. It has a very powerful message for anyone of any age.
 I had trouble putting this book down. The story is very imaginative and the charscters truly interesting. A great inside look at what it was like inside Nazi Germany for one small town. Having Death tell the story gave an even more interesting perspective. When I finished the book I rented the movie and I highly recommend that also. They did a wonderful job of following the book and the casting was great.
 I have read tons of books about the horrible atrocities performed by the Nazis regime!  Every time I finish a book I am numb by the facts of the brutality and inhumanity.  Today I am fairly certain that I shouldn't be because of the Book Thief words and feelings. People on both sides of this equation are numb and inhuman.  It proves how easily such acts can be carried out because when we become inhuman anything could happen. The story is quite moving!
 This is such a well written book that anyone could enjoy. A good read about life and death and a helpful understanding of death. A good book for a young person of teen age and up.
 Awesome - I didn't want to read this book because I read some of NIGHT and couldn't finish it.  I finished this one and while I cried my eyes out I am still glad I read it - poignant.  In times like we are having now, this book restores your faith in humanity. When the dark envelopes you, take faith that humanity has a away of shining light! This book will demonstrate that!
 The Book Thief was written in a very interesting style, with a surprising narrator who's unique view on life gave a new perspective to an oft told tale of Nazi Germany. The book was brimming with emotion and despite the fact that the narrator, more or less, told you what was going to happen at the beginning of each chapter, it never took away from the story. You will laugh, cry, worry, cringe,get angry and finally be sorry that ithe story ended. I know it's a good read because I chose it repeatedly over my electronic games!
 The first time I read this i was 23 and unable to grasp the story. At almost 30 this story changed my heart and is now and forever a treasure!!!!
 This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is so poignant and beautifully written. I will never forget these characters.
 The view of a horrific era by a civilian foster child. The author pulls you in and suspends you in the age between innocence and adulthood; between experiencing the world and interpreting it. What I take from this book is a lesson of survival I have always inherently known, people, individually, can be most kind and brilliant. As a whole, when leadership casts it's ugly eyes towards greed and judgement, they are easily lead to their own destruction by inaction and the need to belong.
 This was a Bookclub selection and a book I probably would not have read because it was set in Nazi Germany.  That would have been a lose.  It was a beautifully written book that gave me a different look into the lives of ordinary Germans during the war.  Terror at being taken away because of a slip of the tongue, hunger, cold, bombs exploding around you or on top of you.  Yet, the children somehow managed to be children at least some of the time.  The human spirit against all odds endures.
 An unusual choice of narrator - using a personification and humanisation of "Death". I found the frequent references to future events and their consequences for characters in the story were distracting and diluted the impact of the narrative. It was akin the being told the identity of the perpetrator and the motive, two chapters into a murder mystery. The emotion that I might have felt had I not known the event was going to happen just wasn't there! I felt cheated to some extent.<br/><br/>However the story itself was gripping. Having been born In Germany, in the period the story was set in, and an avid reader myself, I found myself identifying with the Book Thief. I sat up into the wee hours to finish the book.
 My Grandson will read this as his first book of the New Year!
 Excellent book; kept my interest up to continue reading; story written from the eyes of a child; even though at the end of the book I learned the narrator was death. Germans were very cruel to the Jewish population as well as the German children when they interfered with what the soldiers were doing. German families left behind when their husbands and sons left for war  were left with little to eat (living on food rations). A must read.
 This is one of my favorite books of all time.  The formatting was what first drew me in and from there it was a book lovers book.  For any of us who cannot imagine a life without books, who delight in and cry over the stories presented to us by wordsmiths and who treasure the written word, this is a must have addition to a personal library.
 Well written novel about a German family during WWII living under the Hitler regime.  Opens your eyes to the plight of the average family in Germany during WWI and the terrible effect on their Jewish neighbors and friends.  Speaks to a girl's introduction and love affair with books (words) and how they distracted her from the reality of what was going on around her.  Sad ending but a good book.  Not the action thriller some people are looking for today but a solid read.
 Didn't know what to think when I picked up this novel, I had only read some interesting reviews.  This is one book I have fallen in love with.  It is really one that grabs your heart.  Great writing, very impressive story, leaves you dwelling on it for weeks.  I wanted to turn it back over and read it again right after I finished it.
 I attempted to read this several years ago, but just couldn't get into it. After the movie came out, I saw it and was ready to try to read the book again. Once you can accept that the narrator is Death, you can follow the story more easily. The book has a lot more substance than the movie - more details and additional stories - so I would recommend watching the movie and reading the book at the same time.
 Nazi Germany in miniature - seen through a snow-globe of a small girl’s heart.  Truth seeking and winnowing through the shells of life.  Highly recommended.
 Could not put this book down even though it is a bit depressing. Everyone should read this book so that history might not be repeated right here in the US.  Told from the perspective of the reaper of dead souls, the real horrors of war and especially the fear and oppression of an all-powerful government (Hitler and the Nazi party), become very real and personal.
 At first, having death as the narrator was disturbing, but this is an excellent book.  This is superbly written, although poignant.  Excellent character development and very relatable characters.
 The story showed a side of the war we rarely see.  A German family who has taken in an orphan girl who can't read but longs to.  A foster father who can't read well but is determined to teach his foster daughter what he knows, a grumpy foster mother trying to make do with nothing, and a neighbor boy who longs for a kiss and gets one in the end, boohoo.  And so much more.  All under the thumb of Hitler.  I've read it twice and will read it again.
 I had to read this for summer reading and ended up really enjoying it. I would totally recommend for people to read this book. - Brandy
 You can easily get wrapped up in the book thief. It's story is timeless and the narrator is hands down the most creative and creepy in the business. I'll let you scroll on over to Good Reads to hear synopsis and endless dribble about certain aspects of the book and leave you with this. I read while I travel and this was a great companion while it lasted.
 This book was so good! I loved that it was told from the voice of "Death" and the way it was told was so beautiful, so interesting, so moving, that it brought me to tears a time or two. The subject matter is hard to read-Hitler, his treatment of the Jews, the war, but the people in the story were magnificent! The book is powerful, emotional, and beautiful. I highly recommend it.
 A unique and brilliantly written book.  The author shows how light shines in the darkest of places; how life can be truly dark but because of this, also truly beautiful.
 This book was absolutely stunning. I had to force myself to stop reading at points just so that it could last longer! The narrator brings up some interesting points about humanity, and the characters are, though not always realistic nor relatable, enticing until the last page. You do not want this book to end, but alas it does, and I find its ending symbolic in ways that I can't describe without giving away spoilers.
 I enjoyed the way the book was written: using the narrator to tell the story. Infrequently, a book is written telling the story of Germans during World War II.  Having traveled to Munich, I wondered at the way ordinary Germans viewed the concentration camps.  It is difficult to conceive the Holocaust, and to understand how ordinary people stood by and saw it happening.  This story showed a humanitarian side of Germany. Nicely done.
 The book thief takes its story from Germany in WWII when a young girl is tasked with geowing up in a war torn country led by someone her family did not agree with. This story of grit, love, and persevwrance is one that everyone shouls take the time to read.
 I am 40 years old and have been a book worm since I could speak. This book is on my top 10 (or maybe even top 5) list of my all-time favorite books. I have never had such a strong emotional response to any other book I have ever read. It is so moving, uplifting, and tragic all at once. Having read a library's copy of the book, I purchased the hardback version for my own collection. I am looking forward to my children reading the book, and will likely reread it with them.
 Great story. Heartbreaking but uplifting at the same time. Writing was fantastic and it is written in a way that I think my 12 yer old could read it and not be totally shocked by horrific facts that happened during WWII, it's written from the girl's eyes, so it's fresh, sweet, innocent and overall an easy read.
 Being burned out on any WW2 books, I wasn't interested in reading this.  But on a whim I gave it a chance.  MAN, this BOOK should be required reading in schools.  I LOVED the perspective through death's narrative.  AN excellent story that anyone who may be burned out on anything WW2 would most likely enjoy reading this book.
 There are very few books I have read that leave an impact on me after I have completed it. I can honestly say this is one of few. It is narrated by Death, himself, whom alone is already interesting. But we get to grow up viewing life through an imaginative girl named Liesel who strives through life with the help of books and words. I won't summarize the book, but I just recommend you read it. You will fall in love with all of the characters. It is inevitable. They are written so beautifully and all have something to offer in the world of Liesel's. You will cry, laugh, and sympathize with them because they are wonderful. You will get to experience what life was like during World War II through ordinary German families. There is so much to take away from this book. It's beautiful.
 It's hard to find the words to describe this book...I truly admired the author's style and vivid descriptions and use of color throughout the book. This is one of those books that really fills you with emotion and connects you with the characters. I look forward to reading this book in the future; I feel like it is one of those books that you can always get more out of.
 At first, the writing style was so different that I was not sure I would like the book at all.  That the storyteller was "Death" was also strange for me.  But as the story unfolded and the characters became so real and special, I began to fall in love with the book.  As my title states, the Book Thief, is beautifully written.  This writer is gifted with a powerful command of words.  Lyrical words that thrust you into the story and make you really care about the characters.  This book stayed  with me for days.  It raised the bar for  future reads.
 A great narration by Death. WW II was such a disgrace of human nature. This book shows the Germans as human, flawed, but human. Most Nazi Germany stories will have a German hero or two, but rarely show the human side of the cooperating Nazis. How were average citizens able to 'buy in' in to the fuehrer? I think this book doesn't explain why, but it shows us what it looked like.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful story.
 I don't read a lot but this book captured me.  It's a well written story about a sad time.
 This book is lovely. It was a beautiful read, and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new book to start. Very well written and completely captivating.
 I have not read a story narrated in this way. I started slowly and almost didn't continue. I am glad I did and so will you be.
 I read this book from my local library and thoroughly enjoyed it so much I wanted to share it with my very special niece who is a social worker.  She enjoyed it as well and shared it with her mother.  She recently learned the book has been made into a movie and has extended an invitation to view it together. (We live 200 miles apart.) Nothing like a good book to bring family together.
 I had wanted to read it before I saw the movie but didn't. Wish I has been able to. Just like most movies based on a book much is left out because you can't get inside the character's head. This book, narrated by death takes you so many places in your heart. Read it. You'll love each character and finish the book wishing you got to be with them much longer. Just like people in your life. And feel lots more......
 When I started this book, I was very uncomfortable with the writing style, but, after the first couple chapters, I began to appreciate it and then enjoy it.  As a scrapbooker, it reminded me of how I use anecdotes, lists and pictures to tell the stories of my life. I became very involved with the characters and wanted to know what happened right up to the end.  Besides, how better to tell the story of war but from Death's point of view.
 It's hard to say you enjoy a book about the Holocaust, it just doesn't sound right.  But I did.  I wish I had not seen the promo's for the movie on television because that perfect little girl was in my head as I read it.  I like to imagine the characters myself.  Then when a movie comes out, get all pissed off because they "blew it" - no one looks like I imagined.  I flew thru this book and then at the end, cried like a baby.  I think the word "Sob" more describes what I did.  What I especially liked was the narrator and his perspective on his job and world.  I know a book has gotten to me when I think of it randomly during my day.  Asking myself questions, thinking big deep thoughts, puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so?
 i like the price of the book
 The message I take from this book is how people with so little in their lives and facing hardships endure and carry on.  They do more that just survive; they live their lives and find happiness in the most important thing: the beauty hidden in the people around them.<br/><br/>Yes, the introduction in the beginning of the book is a little odd.  But hang on because the gem of this book is what is found in between in the description of the daily rhythms of lives in wartime Germany.  It provides one with a different perspective on growing up in Germany during WWII.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book to teenagers and adults alike.
 A book club read. Also a wonderful movie. Worth the read.
 I have issues with his 'wordsmithing.'  Sentences have to 'work.'  For instance, "silence" is not a 'who,' and eyes are not "bullet-proof," they 'seem' to be bullet-proof.  Many other examples.  But the work as a whole, it is wonderful.  I highly recommend it.  You love Liesel, you love Papa, you love Rudy, you love them all...and the narrator...who knew Death has a heart?
 This story was beautifully narrated which captured your attention from page one and continued throughout the entire story.  I've ready many books from this time in history, however, this book captured the story from the heart and eyes of a child.  A touching story of a young girl and her love of her adopted family and her best friend Rudy.  I didn't want the book to end.
 All I can say is that it is great. Most other holocaust books show the perspective of the jew who was hidden but this book flips this and shows the perspective of the hider. Leisel, Max, Rudy and all the other characters seem so real, that I actually had to google to check this was really historical fiction. Death being the narrator works SO well. Basically I loved it and I think you will too.
 Written from the vantage point of Death. The horrors of Nazi Germany unfold through the young life of Leisel Meminger. The people of Himmel (Heaven) Street will live for a long time in your hearts after you are finished reading. This story touched my heart in so many ways, I can't even count them. It is the untold story of the worst behavior of those who call themselves human. It will haunt you; I guarantee it!
 The book, which I can't even remember where I read the original raves about it, should be required reading for every school in the country. As a knock your socks off companion piece to 'The Diary of Anne Frank', '...Thief' captures the German side of the war through the story of a young girl being raised by foster parents who end up hiding a Jewish man in their basement. The catch, or the device if you will, is that the compelling, and nearly not depressing (considering the subject) story is told by death himself. This is the book to read in those book clubs after you've all been looking for something like 'The Kite Runner'. It's human, personal, and wonderfully written, and hopefully won't get lost on the shelves of young adult fiction. This is something everyone should be reading.
 I found this book very interesting the way it was written was also very interesting. it reminded me of death in the Disk world series the reason I have only given it three stars is because on my kindle there is a part of the book I can,t read as the font is too small and it would not increase in size even when increasing font size. Other than that a great read and would recommend too all ages
 A wonderful book about a horrible time in history.<br/>The writer takes you by the hand and leads you into the world of the story. You feel the joy, the sadness and the grief.  I didn't want the story to end but when it did... I cried.  Actually, there were several times when the book made me cry.
 I decided to choose this book because I wanted to read it before I watched the movie.<br/>I loved it since page one<br/>loved the way it is written<br/>loved the characters and the story<br/><br/>I would totally recommend it
 Even though this is a book based in Germany during the Holocaust, it is a story of hope and love in the worst of times.  This book is full of insight into how average German citizens in WWII were swept up in propaganda, and why they were unable to take a stand against the horrors of the Nazi regime.  The book was not dark, surprisingly enough.  It was full of human kindness and rich, full characters that made for a page turning read!
 This old guy viewed the excellent movie in November in Colo Sps CO.  Read the book this last week in January after receiving my very first book with Amazon. One could emphathize with the starving German population in middle 1940's. Alot of Americans can not fathum the Jewish suffering and extermination prior &amp; during WW II.  The Book Thief was a snap shot of southern Germany. during the late 30's and middle 4o's.
 A wonderful read from the perspective of a young girl and the challenges she faced in a German family during the War.  It was beautifully written and the characters are wonderful. It's an emotionally charged book, but one that I think many should read, especially if you enjoy heroic stories of many common families living in war-torn Germany at that time.
 The author wrote this book from a very interesting perspective. It is narrated by Death. At first it is a bit disconcerting but as the story goes along it works really well. The characters in this book are well developed and you feel genuine empathy for them. It manages to tell the story of what went on with the Jews during the Holocaust without getting gory or maudlin. This is a really good book.
 Marvelous, glorious, moving, achingly sad. Possibly the best book I have ever read. Definitely the most beautifully written, with so many amazing metaphors. A great book about WWII that humanizes the difficulties and the wretchedness of living during, through and surviving a war on one's own land. A book that is humbling and uplifting, with my tears spilling throughout the last few pages.
 A wonderful group of stories, all interwoven.  This is a deeply-moving book.  Maybe have a few tissues handy.  From the first page, and meeting the unusual narrator, I knew this one would be different.  Meeting all the characters, all facets of the human race, was a joy.  This is the kind of book you hope to stumble onto, so often they're let-downs.  Not this one!  Thank God for the movie or I wouldn't have found it.
 A unique and in many ways,a thought provoking story. I have not seen the film, neither do I wish to now that I have read the book but on reflection I feel the film would perhaps prove an 'easier' read. Having taken a chapter or two to get into the story line I found myself overcoming my concern at having the Grim Reaper narrating and discovered a love of, and for, the characters...and the plights they found themselves in. Having been a child of the war myself...and my most cherished possession a book...I could well relate to The Book Thief and feel sure it will not be the last time I will turn it's pages
 Difficult to read at times because of the subject. But wonderfully written, especially the last quarter of the book.
 Having read many books about the Halocaust and the world during WW II, I found The Book Thief showed mamy aspecys in a diferent light.  I found the beginning a bit hard to follow but then it all cleared up. The characters became so real you felt like you were there observing everything.  I find that I am still thinking about the real statement of this book and how it affects the world, past and present.  Kudos!
 Amazing! When I first started reading the book, realizing that the narrator was Death, I was a bit apprehensive as to whether it would keep my interest. However, from the very opening to the last page, this book had me. It was touching how the author was able to write a story ( narrated by Death, set in the time of World War II and The Holocaust ),that was a reminder of both  the frailty and  strength of humanity, so easily overlooked or lost in that evil point in history.  If you plan on watching the movie as well, read the book first. I have a great respect for the adapted screenplay but the book is the real deal.
 This is a book I would recommend to youth and adults - everyone should read it to know what Germans and Jews went through during the years of WWII.<br/>This book shows that humans can be good and humans can be bad. What makes us one way or the other? Why was Hitler so successful with his Words of propaganda? Can words really be that persuasive? I think so ... even in the year 2014 this book makes us think about our leaders. Will we all dig deep into our own souls before we follow the Words of a persuasively delirious man? History has a way of repeating itself and I think now we need to stand up and pay attention!
 I didn't give it 5 stars because I felt there were times where it lost my interest. It took me a while to read it. I loved that it was narrated by death. This was the only book I've ever read that made me cry my eyes out! I've watched many movies that made me cry but never read a book that made me cry...this was my first. For it to pull that kind of emotion from me, the ending was written very well.
 Reluctant to read it at first (because of the unusual narrator), I became immersed in the world of Leisel Meminger and everyone else in this small town in Germany.  I soon realized that the narrator was sympathetic, the characters  believable and sometimes heart-rending, and the story was compelling and with all that, The Book Thief is one of those books you will always remember, it shows clearly that many of the German people were also victims of the Third Reich.
 Excellent book. The writing style was a little unusual, but the story itself moved forward at a nice rate. The characters were written very well and it was easy to really get into the story. Very sad yet moving story about a group of people living in Nazi Germany at one of the worst times in human history. The spirit of humanity is shown clearly.
 I loved  the story, this was a very difficulté Time for the whole world. Of course I hate hitler, and I am sure that some<br/>Germans didn't agree with what he did but were not strong enough to fight him openly. People were afraid... And for good reasons. Let young people read the book and realize that they should never let any body twist their conscience.
 The writing is poetic, yet communicates the horrors of war without gruesome. violent details.  Told from the perspective of death, the authors portrays death as sympathetic to its victims.  The story also narrates the plight of regular German citizens caught up in the consequences of a war they had no part in starting.  I put this book among some of the top ones I have read.
 Difficult at times to read &amp; understand but the overall story that is set in Germany in the 1939 - 1945 time frame is really interesting &amp; informative once you realize what's going on. At one point Markus shows a parallel between Adolph Hitler's strategy to get into power and Donald Trumps actions but in all fairness, I'm not sure if it was deliberate.
 Words. Well used and well chosen. What a unique way to tell a story set in WWII Germany. Different and compelling. I love that it feels so real and true, honest. None of the usual "feel good" so the audience won't be unhappy stuff that often is put in books and movies. On the reverse side, it's not overly horrible either, where it feels as if it's there for shock value, it's just real.<br/><br/>One of the best books I've read in recent years.
 The Book Thief stole my emotions right out of me!! Was such a different writing style it took a while to get into it. It quickly grabbed me and I was totally invested in it. Being a fictitious story, it was written so realistically that you forgot it wasn't something that could of very well happened. Markus Zusak is a master storyteller and had me crying in the latter part of the book. Great book and I highly recommend it. I can't imagine the movie being as good or better than the book but I am anxious to watch it now. Thank you. Sincerely Robert Y.
 The book is very interesting and descriptive of the time and place it took place.  From the descriptions of the places and people involved (including the "descriptive" language used between "friends") I could really "hear' the characters talking in this manner.  I am not too sure where the :"messenger" came in, but he was a very important part of the book.<br/><br/> I am not waiting to see the movie.  I will be able to compare my mind's vision of people and places from the book to the movie's view.
 I loved the characters so much that I felt as scared as they during the difficulties of living in Germany during these times.<br/><br/>The authors depiction of the ordinary people, the children living innocently, coping with lives made ever more difficult as their parents attempt to endure the ever more dehumanizing effects of Hitler's insanity is exquisite.  Painful to read, but so beautiful to believe in them.
 The only reason I read this book is because my wife told me to.  I'm glad she did.  A young German foundling adopted by a shrewish foster mother whose foil of a husband is all the kindness in the house.  The pair hide a Jew in the basement throughout the war.  The girl, Liesel, sees Jews being herded to Dachau.  She has friends and is something herself as a scamp. It's a good read and well worth the time.
 The writing was very well done, filled with amazing metaphors and similes.  And the narration done from Death's point of view was very interesting because it was so neutral, not at all gruesome.  However, the author created the story and environment so real and depressing that I didn't want to finish the book.  And that is sad because the story was interesting and the writing very nearly brilliant.
 I believe that this should be a required high school read.  It probes into the diverse lives; Jewish, Communistic values, and German citizens living everyday lives in a war torn country of varying political views.  It gives insight of the youth of the day and the people who instilled their values making what wasn't acceptable in the best of days but justifiable in food rations, survival and fate.
 This powerful story was woven in such a way that the reader is completely swept up in the emotions of the characters. The premise of the book, being written by "Death" seemed weird at first, but turned out to be a stroke of genius. I was totally engrossed and moved. Beautiful, sad, hopeful all at the same time. Not to be missed!
 The Book Thief is a story of a young girl and her life just before and during WWII while she lived in a small town in Germany.  The writing is truly amazing.  The author paints pictures with words.  The first half of the book held my attention as the story is being told by Death (yes as in the Angle of) but after that it started to become a bit long with little to make want to turn the next page.  It has now become one of those books that so many others say they enjoy so I feel I must at least finish it.
 This book is fantastic. Merging life, pain, survival during a very dark time in world history is beautifully written. The narrator of the book brings a different dimension. I'm hesitant to see the movie because I do not believe a two hour movie can capture the intricate human emotions and relationships.
 It sees things through the eyes of a child and her family.  It answered a lot of questions I had as to why Germans would even participate in the things that took place during the war.  It took a bit of getting used to the format of the narrator being death itself.  I was so looking forward to the movie as soon as I finished; and found myself disappointed because of the things that were changed and, especially, the things that were left out.
 Once you get intertwined in the characters you just have to know how their story ends.  It is a  little confusing in the beginning until you realize who is the narrator.  This is an endearing story set in a time in Germany that is still hard to understand how such depravity could happen to its own citizens.  Yet there are always heroes in such times and they give this story its high moments.  Enjoy!
 Oh the horrors of the holocaust and World War II.  Amazing tale.  LOVED IT!! If my mother were alive, she'd have eaten this one up, as she did all things about the evil that existed for the Jewish people. Congrats on the success of this book. I could so relate to Leisel for wanting those books so badly. In fact, I'm just admitting this out loud, and on the internet, but in my youth, I too stole a book or two. I HAD to have them. A very poignant, beautifully written tale. Thank you!
 I liked this book very much, the author shows great talent, just the right humor in a very serious and sad subject matter. The author's descriptions made the story come to life.  We are reading it in a book club and then plan to follow up with the movie.  It was a little hard to get started with, hard to understand who the narrator was, and then to learn that the narrator is death seemed a little spooky.  It helped to read about the author and why he chose death to be telling this.  One could not help loving Leisel and her step father.  Some of the language was a bit rough but I was thankful the story was not ruined with sexual encounters.
 The Book Thief is in a class of its own.  A poignant, heartbreaking portrayal of Nazi Germany. Apathetic people, passionate people..full of fear, love and hate. The war cut through the heart of Liesel ...the Saumench...who loses her brother and mother, loves again and loses again.  Death happily gathers souls in the dust. This book is a ten...but my tears cloud my judgement.
 The plot of this book is eloquently outlined in the notes.<br/><br/>Death himself is the narrator and we come to know him as well as we want to know him until...<br/><br/>He makes the mistake of getting personally involved with the sister of a boy who died enroute to foster parents in Hitler's Germany. Death follows the girl's progress in her life, whom he is fascinated by. Her love of books makes her a book thief in a time where books and outside thinking was not allowed.<br/><br/>Zusak's writing is amazing - poetic, flowing. This is not a child's book - it touches you on so many levels. During a time of horror that is remembered by those who had parents/grandparents involved in WWII, to those who haven't (somehow) been touched by that era, this book is magic from cover to cover.
 I'm not a movie person, but when I saw the ads for the movie "The Book Thief" it perked my interest so I got the book.  I was surprised to see this advertised for younger readers (13+); I find it more adult.  This book is narrated by "Death" which is interesting in itself.  I was swept up with the emotional content of the family, their neighbors and this time in history.  I highly recommend it.
 Great read! The story took a bit to catch me but once it did it was great! I would recommend this book to my friends looking for a good read.
 The Book Thief was a pretty easy read, despite the subject matter. The story was interesting, character development was good, the writing style was great and draws you into the story, and while it's a tough ending, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br/><br/>The writing stood out the most, not necessarily the style (written from the voice of Death) but the language. It is beautifully descriptive, and stood out to me throughout the book. Definitely worth the read for anyone in my opinion. Just expect sadness with a WWII setting, so if you're not surprised by that it makes it easier.
 I devoured this book in short order.  Couldn't lay the book down.  Be sure to read the book before seeing the movie or you will be quite disappointed.  I admire the characters strength of putting human dignity and respect for others first in their lives.  This story lends a true picture of how Hitler's power was able to be slowly absorbed into everyday life.
 Telling you about the colors and things before each chapter  was weird.  Too many German words. Also never explaining why Max never came out of the basement besides being Jewish.
 Great story.  Amazing characters. It takes you right into the homes of those who suffered in the war and shows their bravery and determination to survive.  Yet it is not a graphic war story.  Loved every minute of it and will probably read it again.  Not many books I wall say that about.  "The Dog Lived and So Will I" is another one I may read a second time.
 Initially I avoided The Book Thief. I was afraid...afraid of the sadness, afraid of feeling the anger about what I knew would  happen. However, once I started reading, I became engrossed in the tale. For it is, after all, the story of life. We all experience loss, love, anger, fear and happiness all balled up together  ion our journey. While the magnitude of the horrific reality of these gruesome acts is surely catastrophic, The Book Thief explores and offers up these events from the other side of the looking glass, one by one...through the power of words. A must read!
 Amazing narrative about  the days in Germany as Hitler came to power which focuses on one small town and the effects of Nazism on it. In addition, the choice of Death as the narrator, while initially not  clearly apparent, becomes another layer of fascination as  the source through which the story is revealed, at almost a page by page rate.
 This was a truly fascinating book.  The author writes differently from any I've read, and the descriptive words he chooses are quite entertaining, as well as the identity of the story teller.  It was easy to love the main characters, and the setting in time is heart-wrenching.  I had heard it was a good book, and it took me a few pages to get drawn in, but then I didn't want to put it down.
 Hard read, couldn't keep my self reading it, but had to finish it as it was picked for a book club reading.
 I haven't read this book yet but I went ahead and bought this version of it. The cover is beautiful and I love it so much!
 An incredibly beautiful book!<br/><br/>This is a story of a young German girl abandoned in the late 1930's and her ordeal of survival over the war years in Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>The story is told by the personified spirit of Death; a sympathetic Death who is so worn out and so tired from the countless millenniums of collecting souls. A Death so discouraged  by man's inhumanity to man that when is sees something special in our heroine (the book thief) he decides to follow her story over the next few years.<br/><br/>Deeply, deeply moving, insightful and, as is often the case in periods of dire circumstance, occasionally humorous. There were moments of profound revelation, moments of quiet discovery that took my breath away; moments when it was difficult not to stop reading and reflect on what one has just read.<br/><br/>Reading this book reminded me somewhat of  "The Diary of Anne Franck" and although the stories were completely different there was a connection because of the era involved and the wonderful, emotional impact of the written word on the page.<br/><br/>All in all, a beautiful, compelling story.  Highly recommended!  5 Stars,  more if  I could.<br/><br/>P.S. surprisingly enough this book is found in the young adult section of  most book stores; this I feel is a inappropriate classification. This novel really is an adult book and should  be placed as such.
 I really enjoy historical fiction. This was a really creative and well written story about a little German girl, during WW2. It seems a little strange at first, when you realize who the narrator is, but just keep reading and it's a beautifully descriptive story with a redemptive ending.
 This was such a wonderfully poignant story that I was sorry for it to come to an end. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I intend to so I can see if it's as good as the book......but then movies are never as good as the books. I think when reading, your imagination makes the story more lush and vivid than a movie ever could, especially when the book is as well written as this.
 Great story. Sad story but somewhat predictable
 Incredible and very moving story. I also read the book, which is terrible, very scattered, and has no plot. Its rare that the movie exceeds the book, but this is one you movie you should not miss. You will love the characters, the pacing,  and the rise and fall of the Nazi era told from the viewpoint of a simple non military population, and the terrible effect it had on them all.
 I purchased this book on my Kindle two months ago.  In that time I have read this The Book Thief three times and have presented it to my book club for others to enjoy.  I recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the happenings during World War II and the amazing ability of people to overcome trials when faced with adversity, demonstrate support and loyalty for strangers, and keep promises given to loved ones. A touching story told from a very different perspective.  A must read!
 The story is told from Death's perspective of the war. At first I struggled with the approach the author took to telling the story about a book thief who lived in Germany during WWII.  Then as the book progressed I understood and enjoyed reading death's perspective.  I even found it a little humorous  when death would jump ahead of himself and share tidbits of the story before events happened.  A good read - I would highly recommend it.
 This book needs to be in a special category where we can give a book of this caliber a whole constellation of stars. I'm not into giving away the plot of a book...other's do that so well. This book is so inventive, so beautifully written, so lovingly narrated (by Death! who is a most compassionate character) it is a joy to behold. For YA readers (and I'm glad I didn't know that it was for that audience because I may have skipped it) the book has some drawings and lots of white space so they feel like they are reading a very long (over 500 page) book, when, in reality, with different typesetting and formatting it could easily fit into 250 pages. The characters will stay with you forever and all I can really say is read it, read it, read it and then buy 5 copies and give it to everyone you love. I did get to hear Markus Zusak speak at a bookstore and he said it is the story of his grandmother. It is amazing what people can live through. He is a really great speaker and a fantastic writer. Treat yourself to one of the best books you will ever love.
 I have to say that when I first started reading The Book Thief I wasn't very happy with the the format the writer was using. Also, I was very confused as to what was happening. As I read on and firgured out who was narrating the beginning of the book I came to understand what the story was all about. I did get used to the format the author was using and actually came to enjoy it. I won't tell you who was narrating the beginning and because you'll figure it out. All in all in was a good story and I enjoyed reading it. I would recommend it to most readers.
 Really loved reading this book.  The best way for me to describe it is to say it's "splendid literature"!  It really depicts what World War II was like during that time period for even the German everyday citizens who not only didn't choose the war; but felt it morally wrong;  It goes into their daily struggles to survive it as well; the writer does a beautiful and poignant job with the characters.
 Beautiful story, great writing, and memorable characters. You will not regret this read.
 Unlike other looks inside of Hitler's Germany, this book shows what WWII was like for average German citizens who were not Nazis, didn't want to persecute Jews, and simply wanted to live a normal life. A normal life, of course, was not possible with Nazis dominating every aspect of their lives, and then allied bombs falling. An eye-opener.
 It is a very entertaining novel that documents how the people lived their everyday lives and tribulations in a poor neighborhood in Germany during Hitler's government and how they coped with it. The story is narrated by  an impersonation of 'Death' itself, as an onlooker of the activities and events ln which the neighbors participate. The author uses a little girl's (then a preteen) experiences while living here, as a means to describe  the content of book.
 Recover your humanity in this tail of joy and woe.  Given a moment I  could not read on through death.
 I saw the trailers for the movie, and thought it was interesting, but given the typical types of books I gravitate toward, didn't make a move to purchase this one.<br/><br/>I bought it for my Kindle on a whim.  And boy am I happy with that whim!  It took me a bit to really get into it, but once I did, I had trouble putting it down.  I truly enjoyed the perspective of the narrator, and the descriptions used were a breath of fresh air.  Of course this book isn't the most lighthearted novel - I wouldn't expect any novel set in World War II Germany to be fluff.  But, while it made me think, and made me feel for the characters, it wasn't overbearing.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the book so much that I've been suggesting it to nearly all of my friends and family!
 I love this wonderful and imaginative novel. It was almost experimental - and extremely informative at the same time
 I heard they were making a movie of this book, so I ordered it.  Beautifully written, and so interesting.  I enjoyed the movie afterwards, and oddly enough, I was not disappointed like I usually am after expecting more from the movie.  Very few things were different.  The book draws you in from the beginning, much like the movie.  I thought both were beautifully done, even though it's about the holocaust.
 I'm always afraid to read anything that is remotely to do with the holocaust.  I don't need to torture myself with the horror of that event.  But this was done very well and was more about the girl and the German People's point of view during the war.  I enjoyed it very much and would certainly recommend this book.  We don't often get the perspective of the German People and World War II.
 I am Alan's wife &amp; am the one reviewing this book.  This was one of the most powerful and riveting books that I have ever read.  Such an unusual way of narrating a story filled with history, depth of character &amp; even humor.  Tears filled my eyes as the tale came to an end.  The power of words was brought to life in a number of ways both good &amp; bad.  I have recommended this book to both family &amp; friends.
 Years ago I bought this book for my granddaughter and read it before I gave it to her.  Flash forward to now and my book group has decided to buy it.  I decided to buy a used book and was pleasantly surprised to find it in almost new condition.  I end of the cover had a crease in it.  That's it!  No markings inside, etc.  Meanwhile the book was great and our group had an excellent discussion.
 The viewpoint of the narrator was interesting. The book started slow and got much better. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy reading and are willing to get past the boring parts (the first say 175 pages) to discover the rest of the book. Liesel always kept hope even when times were horrible. This book deals with the constant battle between good and evil and love and war on Himmel street during the holocaust and World War II.
 I admit this style of writing threw me off at first but I ultimately was engrossed in this story. I loved this book, it gave me a new perspective on a time in history I have read a lot about but gave me a thought provoking glimpse into another side to this history, a human element, an everyday person in Hitler's Germany, and narrated by Death, an I intriguing view to say the least....do not pass this book up it is a great read
 I love this book.  Other folks did and made a movie.  Nazi Germany, a young girl dealing with a lot of stuff, including living in Nazi Germany.  Expressed from the resilience and strength of a child.  Not graphic violence, but definitely the realities of life.  If a kid is old enough to read this, I say let them, and definitely a powerful read for an adult also.
 I finished The Book Thief on Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. How appropriate.  On this day G-d decides who shall live and who shall die. The author, the narrator, is almost like G-d but he doesn't decide; he only picks up the souls of those who passed away. And so many souls to pick up in Germany during WWII. This book should be must reading for everyone.
 My granddaughter suggested I read "The Book Thief" and I had trouble in the beginning. It wasn't making sense nor was it easy to follow. I realized at some point I couldn't put it down and Liesel became so very real to me. It was as if I was living her life. My heart ached for her, her family, Max, Rudy and her community. This book will not be forgotten.
 A beautiful skillful and artistic book. I also learned a lot about WWII Germany in the process. The book gives a much more sympathetic description of what life was like in Germany for civilians. Using the grim reaper to tie it altogether was a brilliant trick. Excellent book!
 A beautiful story about the Holocaust without the usual storyline.  It took a few chapters to understand the writing style and the fact that the narrator is "Death".  The other characters are very well developed and you will fall in love with the main character.  I can see why it has been made into a movie.  The movie could not possibly surpass the quality of writing that Markus has achieved.
 After visiting the Holocaust museum and hearing from one of its survivors this book really helped to illuminate a part of the events not told that of the German citizens. The genocide of the Jews and the horrors of the concentration camps are not meant to be minimized, and could never be, but the war took its toll across the entirety of the population. This story puts in to perspective the frailty and limit of ones life and existence and the depth and variety of the human soul and condition.
 Skip the reviews, read the book Saukerl.  Genius viewpoint and main character choice, beautiful metaphors and great prose.  Want to spend some time thinking about a novel?  First on list.
 I read a lot of Hollacaust books. not that I like the subject, but because one must remember. and there are times when I just have had too much. like I feel I can't read another one...at least for now. but when this one came my way I reluctantly took it up and was great surprised. the write was one of the most original I have ever read on the subject and pace was amazing. Even when some phrases are reiterated they never slowed the good. It was an incredible wow of a read!
 I was so captured by the story, it’s characters and the historical storyline that I seemed to be a participant in the story. I have read many novels but none have engulfed me more than The Book Thief.
 Told by Death...so interesting from that angle. Germans on the edges of the war, civilians attempting to survive. As the reader, I understood , without approving, the German civilian's daily battle to stay alive, stay human, stay sane. Not all of the characters were able to find a way through the war. I felt just a bit more empathy for them.
 Very deep book! If you like sad endings, this book is for you. 550 pages to read, but definitely worth it! Such a good story, and I would absolutely read it again! I'm going to recommend my friends to read this book! Love it very much!
 Death narrates this book. Yet there are bright shards of light and possibly enlightenment in the pages. Author Marcus Zusak writes from the unusual POV of what it was like to be caught up in Hitler's nightmare - from inside Germany and for the Germans of all backgrounds. Liesel, Rudy, Max, the mayor's wife and the other characters will haunt you long after the final verse. Words are imperfect tools and yet the fabric of this story is beautiful to behold. If you get the chance, read it.
 I didn't enjoy this story as much as I thought I would.  I didn't care for the writing style. I don't like lists or mother interruptions with in the paragraphs. I also feel it's a sad story throughout and I prefer some happiness . There was way too much loss though I am sure that is reflective of the setting .
 It was hard for me to get in to... the concept of the story being written by death is an awesome idea, but it wasn't executed well, and I just wanted him to shut up about himself and tell the story. It got better once he followed my advice, and I eventually began to care about what was happening. I was bawling by the end. If you can get through the beginning, you won't be disappointed by the end.
 From beginning to end this book captured my undivided attention.  It was not just hard to put it down everynight, but to finish it.  It left me wanting for more.  Excellent writing, and I liked the idea of having death as the narrator in the book.  Also, I had never read a book from a young German girl's point of view of World War II.  Very enlightening.  I recommend this book!
 I'm an avid reader and LOVE finding books like this. I couldn't put it down. It was touching and sad, but altogether brave! The writer was excellent in giving you details without going overboard, and for having you feel like you know the characters as well as your own family. I don't usually reread books, but this one is going to be read many times. Everything about this book is excellent.
 This book turned out less predictable than I originally thought, taking you by surprise at every corner.<br/><br/>Although the story overall was a little drawn out, I enjoyed the narrative style chosen for this book. It is told from the perspective of Death, giving the story a unique angle.<br/><br/>I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in WWII literature. But beware to be confronted with all the horrors of this time in history. This book does a nice job of addressing them that is at once utterly saddening yet digestible.
 This was a rich book, and I'm sure I will re-read it multiple times.  I enjoyed the humor of the surprising narrator, the format of the text, and the authenticity of a family's approach to caring for Jews during WWII.  It is a coming-of-age novel about a young girl and her love of books, her journey to discover herself, and her developing maturity as she learns about compassion and friendship.
 Loved this book and so glad I read it instead of just seeing the movie (which I haven't yet). Liesel is a great character. I enjoyed reading about the war from the daily, German point of view in a town walking distance from Dachau. While central to the story, the holocaust was also somehow on the periphery so that the human interactions shown through - including the craziness, prejudices, fear, and passions. A wonderful read.
 A beautifully written and poignant story. It takes you to Nazi Germany and you feel the fear that can grip a whole society. It also tells a beautiful story of friendship and love that can survive in the worst of conditions. From the beginning you see that the narrator is death itself. Very fitting for the heartbreak of genocide of a people forged from ignorance and racist fear. I will recommend it to my book club.
 best book eva created it has deaths and young love weird parts but I think it's a must-read book for the future of children telling historical fiction sorta death is the narrator and liesil meminger is the protagonist of the story her "boyfriend" is Rudy Steiner and is adorable... I want to see da movie and divergent too soooo bad !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!# I love that book thief movie!!!!!!!:-) ;-) ()()()()()()()()()()()()()()().
 I bought this book after it was recommended by a book blogger, and I love it! It gives a more realistic look to what life was like in the days of Nazi Germany. The tale is told by an interesting character, to say the least....but I won't ruin the surprise for all of you! The story is of a little girl who deals with the trials and hardships of Nazi Germany, and uses books as her escape from the ugly reality of things. I definitely recommend this book for anyone who loves a good read!
 The storyline here was a bit different than I was expecting. I actually found it to be somewhat boring.
 It did.  My grandson who is a sophomore was assigned this book for his reading in his honors English course for summer reading.  I personally read it a number of years ago.
 Such a well-crafted story populated with unforgetable characters and a narrator whose voice echoes in my mind long after I stop reading, this is an incredible book!  I had no idea, going into this read, of the topic or anything about the book, and what a gem it was to discover--better late than never!!  I understand it's been made into a movie, yet I have no desire to see it--I saw it all so clearly as I read, and fear that any attempt to portray the narrator and his characters, other than as was so masterfully done by the author, would be a disappointment.  It's been done in the pages of the book to the point that this story will live in my mind vividly forever!
 The presentation of the dialogue was different to any I have experienced in the past--it took a little getting used too but that was not to say it was unpleasant--just 'different! The story was at first hard to come to grips with and certainly gave me an insight into another side of the German and Jewish  peoples lives. I found the book capturing my attention at any time I set out to read --hence I read it quickly!. A good attention grabber and one I would have no hesitation in recommending to my family and friends.
 I have read several books concerning Nazi Germany. This was the most real and horrific series of events concerning this time period artfully explained and captivating. It truly gives the reader the view point from within. I may need to read it again. I too do that with my favorite books.  I especially loved the narration. With out spoiling the book for you this was an unusual and creative concept that improved with each narration.  I enjoyed the little bits of commentary, the examples, then the explanation as the plot grew slowly and fate intervened. I enjoyed reading this book very much.
 This was my second copy purchased--I read this three years ago (during a difficult time) and wanted to reread it when the movie was released. Found my first copy in a book store under "young adult fiction," and it's so universal and so important a message that I beg to differ! I recommend it most highly to any thoughtful reader of teenage upward.
 I went back and forth between a four and five star rating for this book. Star ratings are just so inadequate. You cannot convey the value of a book through a 1 to 5 rating.<br/><br/>This book had quite a few flaws for me. It tried very hard in places to be something it wasn't. Efforts were made for presenting flowery prose that didn't quite get there. But the ideas of this book... they are rumbling. Not just new or original, but profound. This is a book to challenge preconceived ideas from youth. I am so jealous of Zusak's storytelling capability. While the language might not be there for me, andhis structure a little confusing at times—he knows how to spin a tale and conjure character. Five stars are given for making me think.
 It started out a little weird, but I stuck with it and read the rest in one day! I have trouble wanting to read a book if I don’t get it on the first page. I found if I just give it a little bit more time it becomes one of my favorites. I loved this book and the characters, but the subject is so disturbing, you need to read a comedy (like one of Stefani's Plum ) right after.
 An elegantly written if depressing novel. Depressing because of its setting--a village outside Munich during WWII. We know that not much good is going to happen during that time and in that place. Elegant because the characters are so engaging--especially the kids whose story this is and, of course, the narrator. I have no wish to see the movie since I'm afraid it would be a kind of watered-down version of a very tough narrative. Read the book instead.
 I know.  This is a book that you will either love or hate. No middle road it seems.  I love this.  The imagery, the language and the ease of the read.  I have been surprised that people do not like this but that is what makes the human race interesting.  Marcus has written for an age group and this book possibly is for that age group, so call e adolescent ... I do not care.  The people I know who have read it are from 23 to 67...they all love it.
 Liesl Meminger and her story are now a part of me, as if I'd been on Himmel Street. It's a story about the best in humans and the fuzzy edges between best and worst.  It explores the unique moral code of those whose lives make less sense than they should.  And, as a bonus, it frames Death as compassionate, not fearsome. Superbly and ingeniously conceived and executed. A very compelling read!
 Excellent book, loved the perspective of the grim reaper talking. This provided a perspective of the German people during WWII that said we really did not want this and there was a lot of pain for some very good people. On the side of the foster parents I want to nominate them for a foster parent award. Really in the middle of their pain and no food they took on this other person to feed and loved her totally. These are rare characteristics in a foster parent in good times.
 The book is based on WWII and the struggles of people living in Germany.  There was religious persecution of Jews.  It told about this young girl who wins the hearts of those around her and struggled with hard times and with parents (especially papa) who adopted her &amp; who she eventually grew to love.<br/>This book is a reminder about what can happen to a country whose government takes control over the people and these people fear the new ruler.  They don't always believe in what the government decides to do (the persecution of the Jews).<br/>It is a reminder of the past and how people are affected by circumstances beyond their control.
 This was an excellent book. Zusak cleverly cast Death himself as the narrator and at first I thought the story might be  morbid and dark but it was not at all, instead compassionate and understanding. We should all remember that not all German people were Nazis but were themselves victims of Hitler and pretty powerless to do anything about it.  I see it will be a movie and I'm sure they will ruin the story, as usual.
 i joined a senior book chat &amp; glad i did; i would have never downloaded this book otherwise the reading for the next month; a good read &amp; describes life in germany before &amp; during WWII; picked up a lot in the second half of the book; like the way the grim reaper or whoever he was describes the deaths of mortals on earth; i liked the book although i would not say it was best i ever have read
 I feel exclamation points in this review would be pointless. As I finished this story and stared blankly at my bedroom wall, I was not thinking in exclamation points. Only in colors. In beautiful colors and in utter awe at what I had just read. Told from the point of view of Death, this story reads like nothing else I have experienced.<br/>The story of a  little German girl named Liesel, lovingly called the Book Thief by one of her closest friends, is a tale full of unimaginable sorrow. And wisdom. And fear, mischief, determination, love, anger, more love, and hope. Especially hope. Stick with her to the end, and I promise you won't be disappointed.
 Best read ever.  It one of those books ou are sad to see it is coming to an end.
 It is a very sad story, even more shocking when we realize that many such episodes have indeed happened during the war. The book makes us wonder if wars are ever, ever justified. The book is very well written. The suffering is immense (as very well portrayed in The Book Thief), less so for the politicians (who are the ones who ultimately declare their wars) than for the overall population, the greatest sufferers. I would definitely recommend the book in the hope that more people can fully understand the exact meaning and the dire consequences of "going to war".
 Great POV narration for a heart wrenching tale. The author weaves a tale that can surely be any child's formative years that grew up in Nazi Germany during WWII. Heart breaking moments, which reminded me a lot of Les Miserables (orphaned girl, growing up poor in politically dangerous times)<br/>Highly recommended, with the warning; You will cry, and feel for Liesel as she survives day to day with her family and friends on Himmel street.
 Actually, I just wanted to see what reading material my 16 year old granddaughter was finding interesting.  I enjoyed the book more than I expected.  The response of young people to war is on a different level than adults.  Perspectives are formed and framed in context to themselves more so than the world view.  I would say this is a good thought provoking book for teenagers and adults alike.
 I found the book to be interesting and very moving.  The characters were real to me throughout the book.  It brought the awful story of Germany's role in WW II, and how ordinary people reached beyond themselves to help the helpless.  It also protrayed the misery of those ordinary people during the war, whether deserved or not.  War doesn't pick and choose who is rightous.  Everyone suffers.
 I enjoyed this book, as I have been reading several books in the past few months that center around Europe during WWII. It is told from a different perspective and it was hard to put down. I felt sad at the end and wish Liesel's life could have been followed at least for a few more years. I definitely will share this book with others.
 I started reading this, because of the recommendation of a friend, and at first was put off somewhat by the structure of the beginning chapter or two.  However, the book and characters drew me in and I could not put it down.  Just a wonderful book!  Memorable, even though it has been awhile since I read it.  I will reread this book with enjoyment.
 I first of this because of the movie that was recently made.  After reading the description I decided to read the book instead of seeing the movie.  I'm glad I did.  This book was excellent.  Rarely have I given a book 5 out of 5 stars.  The storytelling was amazing.  The descriptions made it so easy to visualize what was happening.  It was, at times, beautiful, sad, funny, tragic.  It was amazing.
 Awesome book that I was asked to read before I saw the movie.  So glad I did because I loved it and hope to read it again soon.  I have thought of some of the main characters almost every day since I read the book, (in a very positive manner!)  Did not know anything about it before I read the book, but was it suggested by someone of which I .have great respect.  I think it was beautifully written and very meaningful to me personally.
 This was a very well written story about a hard topic. I was immediately drawn into it and became quite attached to the characters...even the narrator! It was told from a good mixture of perspectives...from flashbacks to the future. Most loose ends were very well tied up at the end, except maybe I'd like to know exactly how the book thief wound up where she did.  A very deep and thought provoking book. Not an easy read by any means, but a very good one.
 My son had to read this for 7th grade so I read it along with him.  It's told from Death's point of view of a girl in Germany during the Nazi's.  The story is well told and a great piece for middle schoolers to read.
 I do enjoy reading this book.  The author has a different style of writing then I am used to but he keeps me wanting more. I am not quite done with the book yet but that is okay.  It is the first book I am reading on my Kindle, yes I have almost crossed over from paper books.. almost.  Anyway, I am very happy with the quality of the book, the story of Lisel and all of the other folks in this book.
 A totally compelling story, very well written.  the author communicated the hardships and horrors we associate with Nazi Germany in a readable, believable way.  You feel for the characters, and  I came to appreciate both the strengths and flaws in each.  I bought this book because I had heard a review of the movie and I like to read books before seeing movies.  I was truly not disappointed. Bravo Mr. Zusak!
 This is the third book I have read recently where they jump all over the place in the story with chapters of past situations of the characters.<br/>Why can't authors keep a nice fluid move through the story?<br/>This story line is great, but isn't easy to stay involved with.<br/>Also, many of the German words are not explained for defined; even when using the kindle for definitions.
 This is a book that is intense, suspenseful, and sad. The fact that is based on a true story keeps a reader fascinated to see the final outcome of this set of experiences that are truly gut wrenching. It was very heartwarming of the two people at the end of the story to see one another again. This part gives the reader hope after a time of war.
 I ordered this for my 13 year old daughter's kindle. She didn't want to read it at first she said it was a little too hard and was being lazy, I made her keep on going with it and if she got stuck she could look up definitions. She can't put it down now. Now I have to tell her it's time for bed and she has to put the book away!
 I'm not a literary genius, but this book is friggin' great. All kids should read this book. A couple friends and I discovered the book when an English teacher Senior year in high school (2010) recommended it to us to read. I got to read it first and I will say I do not regret reading this. The way the book is told from Death's perspective is really, really something and really unique. Buy it! You will not regret it.
 My daughter who is in 5th grade and has a 12th grade reading level is reading this book. She noted to me that it does have some swearing words in it. She says the book is told by death and how it's describing a young girls life ( again told by death) . She also says the book is taking place in the time of World War Two and is in Germany. " one of the best" she quotes! I should read the book myself!
 A beautiful story about the power of words, compassion and love in a violent time. The stories of simple decent people in a totalitarian state are rarely told,<br/>particularly in Nazi Germany.  We know about the victims and survivors of the holocaust, and of the evils of the German perpetrators of unspeakable horror upon over 12 million dead and millions of survivors. This is the story of a few people of dignity and humility who did not lose their humanity but reached out and helped some of those who suffered most. They also paid a terrible, and sometimes ultimate price of war, which does not discriminate among its victims. I could not put this book down and the story and the characters will always be with me. Thank you Markus Zusak for this beautiful book.
 This may be labeled as a 'teen fiction', but it's so well worth the read. Finally saw the movie this weekend and the book is still better. It's an unusual twist on an often-told story taking place during Nazi Germany. No matter how many stories like this you may read, this one holds it's own at the top. Well worth your time, no matter your age.
 I just finished reading "The Book Thief."  It's a long time since reading a book made me cry, but this one did.  It's like nothing I've every read before, narrated by Death, who is a surprisingly sympathetic character.  The writing is so beautiful and poetic.  This is just one of the best books I've ever read and I can't wait to see the movie.
 It has been too long since I've found a book such as this whose characters linger with me even after the last page is read. Even more impressive is that my middle school students recommended this book to me. We had just finished a Holocaust unit just before the movie premiered, so the suggestion was a natural next step. I loved the author' s surprising figurative language and use of first-person narrator.
 I wanted to read thebook again before I saw the film, but after a couple of pages, I couldn't stand the curiosity and went to the cinea. as soon as the film started I recalled most of the book ( it had been several years since I'd read it ) and I can say it's one of the best stories I'd read about WWII. I'm glad I have it in my kindle, but I have toread it over again, and again, and again...
 It was "too" popular?  Too many book club recommendations? what was I thinking?  This was beautiful, touching, personal, heartbreaking, musical,  triumphant, emotional and simply extraordinary.  Brush away any preconceived notions and just READ.
 I have never read a book written quite like this with its color-brightening phrases and sorrow-laden beauty. This story highlights the grief of the life of one small girl and the freedom of words. The viewpoint of WWII Germany is a different one and seen through the eyes of Death is even more unusual.  Leisel's story is gripping. I feel that I have become a different person by reading this book. It touched my soul.
 A book set in in Nazi Germany that was not centered on someone Jewish?  Never read one before this.<br/><br/>There are two things that I think made this enjoyable for me:  first, I really liked the main character and wanted to know what would happen to her.  Second, sometimes Death would actually tell you what was going to happen, long before it actually happened.  When you know the ending in advance, you aren't so concerned with what ultimately happens, but instead with everything in between, so it keeps you reading.  At least, it did for me.
 The Book Thief was a book club selection which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Some have said it was "dark" but I thought it was most probably exactly how things were in Germany during the war.  I am of German decent so I have always had a fascination with the history of that era. I could hardly put this book down and somewhere near the middle of the book I knew (with great sadness) how it was likely to end.  There were times when I was brought to tears but also there were times when I had to laugh out loud.  Liesel and Rudy were quite a pair!  Loved the book!
 At first I didn't think I would like this book.  After I got into it, I finally began to understand what it was about and found it to be quite interesting.  Now, I can watch the movie that I've had taped on my DVR but did not want to watch until I finished the book.  I do recommend the book, but be prepared to be a little confused at first.
 This is such an interestingly written book. I don't think I've ever read a book that is written from this perspective or with the same writing style. The author's mixing of senses in his descriptions gives a true richness to the story. I also love how this book makes a horrific, tragic period of history approachable and touchable at a human level, through interpersonal stories and description, without explicitly describing the violence and hatred of the time. Remarkably well written and engaging.
 Remarkably well written book, a joy to read. However the enhanced version ends up, in my opinion, being distracting.<br/>My favorite quote from the whole book: *SPOILERS*<br/>"The Germans in basements were pitiable, surely, but at least they had a chance. They were not sent for a shower. For these people, life was still achievale."
 This story was everything I'd hoped it would be and more. It was beautifully written with such delicate,delightful and tastefully raw details that you can't help but fall in love and feel as one with the characters and their stories. I liked that Death was the narrator-it was an "out-of-the-box" point of view, it was told in a tasteful and sweet manner and the progression of the story flowed so nicely. While the plot is based on a tragic time in history, the way the story comes full circle is bittersweet, real and heartwarming. I thoroughly loved this book and hope others find it just as wonderful.
 I bought this book as a gift and didn't read it myself. Nevertheless, the person to whom I gifted it, loved The Book Thief and insisted that I rate it with five stars.
 I don't know what I can say about The Book Thief that hasn't already been said. This is the best book I have ever purchased. I have purchased over four hundred audio books over the past ten years. The Book Thief is well written with wonderful character development. The story captures the spirit of the time in a way that is respectful and insightful. This is a classic I will keep in my library forever.
 However, it is so well done. I recommend everyone read it.
 Arrived in great condition, as advertised
 This book was excellent! I could not wait to see the movie after I read it. The characters were unique, the story line was captivating and the subject was great. I like that this story was about non-Jewish Germans in Germany during the world war 2. We don't get many stories about that side. It showed  not all Germans were hateful and discriminative. The story touched my heart.
 ...Can explain the feeling I have after reading this book. After reading it in one day, I can honestly say that this is one of the best books that I have ever read, so far, in my life. Thank you Markus Zusak for writing such an amazing book. I completely and totally recommend this book to every single person out there who would  Like a book that keeps you completely engaged and enthralled until the end of the book
 I THOUGHT IT VERY INTERESTING WHAT A FAMILY WILL GO THROUGH FOR ANOTHER FAMILY REGARDLESS OF THEIR ETHNIC BACKGROUND.  THE AUTHOR WAS VERY DETAILED ABOUT HOW THEY LIVED AND WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN THAT ERA.  WHAT I DIDNT CARE FOR WAS THE WAY HE JUMPED FROM ONE TIME IN THEIR LIFE TO THE NEXT AND BACK.  IF ON IS SITTING AND READING CONSTANTLY, THEN YOU WOULD PROBABLY BE ABLE TO FOLLOW EASIER.  I MY SELF, READ FOR A BIT AND THEN LEAVE AND COME BACK A DAY OR LONGER.  THIS IS WHEN YOU SOMETIMES HAVE TO GO BACK AND SEE WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TALKING ABOUT.  ALL IN ALL, A VERY GOOD BOOK AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE MOVIE.
 I'm going to give this book two stars instead of one only because it's about an important time in history.  I hated this book.  I got 60% of the way through and couldn't stomach finishing it.  I'm usually the type that will finish a book no matter how much I dislike it.  The author's style is supremely annoying.  "Death" narrates some of the book and speaks in allegories about colors of the sky and colors of people's spirits, blah blah blah.  I found any section where Death spoke as being horribly contrived.  The author painfully attempts to use unconventionally original descriptions of things like, "He ran weedily."  Really?  And if I hear one more description of the father's "eyes of silver" I'm going to puke.
 Finally a great book from the perspective of a German citizen. Having family members there and here in the USA it sheds light on how they truly survived. The main character could have been my aunt who lived in that general area of Germany. Their home was bombed and her sister perished but she survived. When she came to the USA she rarely spoke of that time of her life. I think most Germans were ashamed that that actually happened. But this book is able to shed light on how normal everyday life went on,the sun still shone and lives went on. This book is a keeper , i will read it again and again.
 It's nearly impossible to review something so filled with heart and insight.  I only know that the years that I've lived have a new color and compassion..a new vision of life because of this book. Somehow the gifts it gives to its reader are beyond anything one could hope could come from words.  Thank you so much Mr. Zusack. Life has a glow to it now that carries on past  breathing.
 A story of a time never to be forgotten and an insight into how the people involved lived.  An apparent lack of awareness as to what was really taking place in Germany under Hitler and yet this family knew the consequences of hiding a Jewish person, but they did it anyway.  The story does bring to life the hardships endured by the German people for a war that seemed secondary to them until the bombs started to fall on them. At last the realization of what was happening as they saw the many Jewish people being marched off to a final destination.  This was a good read but not one of my favorites.<br/>+
 I got so involved in The Book Thief.  I rate it as one of the best, eye-opening books I have ever read.  Every night after reading the book and going to bed, I would cry.  Imagining someone wanting to read so bad having to steal to do it.  I have always had books available to me and have been an avid reader.  The evilness of Hitler and the bleakness of the lives of the poor German people who suffered under him is just mind-wrenching.  I came to love Liesl, Rudy, Hans, and especially Max.  How uplifting to see the good side of people like Hans and the mayor's wife.  Such an outrage what Hitler did to the Jewish people!  It is amazing that people do not appreciate good literature or movies that make you think.  I was very surprised that The Book Thief was overlooked at the Golden Globe awards.
 This is probably a young adult book, but being a not-so-young adult, I really enjoyed it.  Great characters, and even though I read it a couple months ago, I still think about it.  The movie has been out and I have been reluctant to see it, but think that I will just think of them as two different things and go see the movie.  Loved the book and was glad I read it and would definitely recommend it to others.  Thx.
 The Book Thief is the story of Liesel Meminger, a nine-year-old illiterate girl who loses her family during World War II. Liesel's story is one of struggle, friendship, love, and courage. However, it's her biographer that makes the story unique. The Book Thief is narrated by Death himself.<br/><br/>Death is an uneasy narrator. He's a skittish personality who fears humans, perhaps as much as humans fear him. Death is an unlikely sympathetic character because he doesn't relish his work. He laughs at the human notion that he wears a cloak and carries a scythe. Instead, Death is an overworked laborer driven by a cruel boss--War. Throughout the story, Death interjects sparse nuggets of helpful information for the reader. He seems to be uneasy with his reading audience as much as he is with his characters.<br/><br/>In spite of his reluctance to get involved with humans, Death finds himself drawn into Liesel's story. The Nazi's imprisoned her father for being a communist and her mother gave her to foster parents before the Nazi's came for her as well. Liesel thus finds herself in the care of a rough but not unkind family, the Hubermans.<br/><br/>It's at the Hubermans that Liesel learns to read and discover the power of words. Hans Huberman becomes a grandfather figure to her and gives her 2 AM reading lessons when Liesel awakes from her nightly nightmares. Rosa is a gruff, cursing matron who eventually reveals a softer side. Liesel also meets some wonderful characters from around the neighborhood. There's Rudy, a young sprinter and fellow thief, who idolizes Jesse Owens. Rudy's obsession with the African-American sprinter doesn't win him favor with the Nazi Youth Party, but he is undeterred.  There's also Max, a young Jew whom the Hubermans hide in their basement. Liesel makes fast friends with each of these youthful men and learns lessons about loyalty, friendship, and love.<br/><br/>In The Book Thief, Markus Zusak captures Liesel's childlike perspective showing that she is somehow able to hold onto while living on Himmel (Heaven) Street - until Allied bombers bring the weight of the war and death to her neighborhood. Zusak is generous with humor and tales of the heroes' thieving mischief. These elements keep the atrocities of Nazi Germany from overwhelming the reader.<br/><br/>The Book Thief ultimately is the story about the power of words. Words provide Liesel escape from her nightmares. Her relationship with Max centers on storytelling. Liesel also comes to the terrible realization that Hitler's Third Reich wasn't built with tanks, but first with words. Teen readers will leave this book with an acute understanding of the power of ideas.<br/><br/>It's hard to find flaws with the Book Thief. The book is dark and tragic. A story involving Nazi oppression narrated by Death seems like a hard sell to the average teen. However, Zusak writes about Liesel's exploits with a gentleness that softens the weight of the book. Parents might want to be aware that there a few curse words sprinkled in over the course of 550 pages. This reviewer doesn't see them as a reason to keep a mature teen from being exposed to the powerful message of the book.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is a worthwhile read. Consider giving this novel to your Senior High School student, and even discussing it together. There are conversations to be had about prejudice, courage, love, and the power of words
 Seldom do you read a book that is as captivating as this one!<br/><br/>Usually World War II novels show the pain and suffering the Germans inflicted on other countries but this one went to great lengths to show how their own people were starved and beaten physically and mentally.<br/><br/>I could not put my IPAD Kindle down, often times reading to the wee hours of dawn.<br/><br/>The book was as moving as the Literary Potato Society......never can get that title right!<br/><br/>I can't wait to see the movie.
 Many books are interesting but these story lines were presented  in totally new very multilayered way. Surely this book won awards for its originality.
 I am an avid reader and have thousands of beloved books in my home.  My top five list had remained intact for at least 25 years until TBT came along!  I have been on flights where this masterpiece has come up in conversation, in a book store in Barcelona, hiking in The Hebrides, a train in Switzerland.  The common thread, THE BOOK THIEF!!!
 This was one of the most beautifully written books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Also fascinating to read through death's perspective. This is easily one of my favorite books of all time.<br/><br/>Kind of wish I read it as a real book though and not on the kindle. Seemed wrong to read a book about how books changed a girl's life on a kindle...
 The perspective of the narrator is disconcerting at first and many people would not feel comfortable as a result. It is also different seeing Nazi Germany from the German villagers' side.<br/>Brilliantly written and totally absorbing. I have purchased three paper copies for family members as gifts so they can also experience the brilliance of this novel.<br/>I would rate it as possibly the best book I have ever read.
 I am writing this through my tears. I am a voracious reader and love most of them, but there are those that live in me.  This is one of them. The style is very different, but the story captures you. Many have been told about that time in history, but this one really accentuates "man's inhumanity to man".<br/><br/>If I had my "druthers", I would make this a must read for all high school age children.  It is a history lesson, a political statement but mostly a call to remember to "love one another as you love yourself". This terrible blight of a time seems destined to repeat itself. How many apocalypses can we withstand?
 Really enjoyed it. Found Death as the narrator interesting. Liked how he is very present at the beginning then he kind of slips in to the background until the end. Quite cleverly done. Liked the style of writing which kind of reminded me of reading a play in parts, complete with list of characters and props! Overall a very enjoyable story. Just saw the film this weekend and as usual, once you've read the book the film just doesn't compare.
 Just finished reviewing this and suddenly my review disappeared! Briefly, this is a book that was not as good as the movie.  I was influenced too, by the fact that I had just finished Anthony Doerr's "All The Light we Cannot See" a true classic covering the same historical period of WW2.<br/>I had also not realized that it was written for "Young Readers" which may have accounted for its writing style. a style that  I found simplistic and un subtle. There were lovely parts to be sure, but all in all I found the format of using Death as a narrator, irritating and at times trite.
 I bought this for my Granddaughter. The book camequicker than promised and in good condition. My Granddaughter likes the story very much as I had.
 Some authors just floor me. What an amazing way to narrate a story and an amazing approach to story telling. I won't tell you who it is  that narrates the story, you have to work it out. Once you have it is just a fantastic read. ( It makes the first couple of chapters tricky ) Amazing insight into events of the times and how people coped, lived, survived. The complexity of the relationships  that develop through out the story make it a dynamic read.<br/>The characters are so well developed and believable, I was sad to leave them at the end of the book.<br/>Just loved it.<br/>I would recommend it to anyone who really love character driven plots.
 I loved this book. It reminded me of Diary of Ann Frank which I read in high school. We even did a drama presentation of the book.<br/>We need to remember how terrifying those days were for the innocent people who were victimized by a sadistic horrible leader and those who were poisoned by his beliefs.
 I don't think I can add anything to my review that people haven't already said, but if you like a good historical fiction about World War II, this is a book I very strongly recommend checking out. Markus Zusak's writing style is some of the best writing I have ever read, and the story is told from the perspective of a very unique and interesting character. Without giving much away, I would say please check it out, you will not be disappointed.
 The quirky style , with the author relating the story from the point of view of "the grim reaper", makes this book highly entertaining. A look inside the lives of Germans under Hitler's jackboot gives a whole new perspective on the WW2 dialogue more commonly portraying this era.Having already seen the movie, I didn't find it riveting as I knew what was to come. However the entertaining writing style and the extra depth in both story and characters made it well worth the effort.
 As a former school media specialist, I love stumbling onto a good book that would have been a treat for my students.  Fortunately, I didn't have to stumble onto this book....the movie lead me there.  The narrator's perspective on the story was a unique and enjoyable twist.  The interspersed historical tidbits were a great addition to the novel, along with the romantic tension created between Rudy and Liesel.  The mystery of when "the kiss" would finally happen kept each scene between the two friends fresh and full of potential.  A thoroughly enjoyable book with enough literary mix for most readers.
 I felt as if the people in this novel were people I knew--suffering people who were neither totally admirable nor totally reprehensible when acting under extreme stress.  I was especially touched by the unexpected scenes of loving heroism from sometimes unlovable characters and by the protagonist's love of books--a passion I can easily understand.  I was unable to access the enhancements offered on my Kindle, but consider the book a total experience rather than just a good read.
 Fantastic book! Loved all the characters - they are so well developed, and the story has so much depth. Everyone tells stories revolving around the holocaust, but this one is told on the fringes, about ordinary people and their struggles, and how they react to an unfortunate man, singled out for his religion.
 The movie stuck very close to the book; and I enjoyed reading it seeing the faces of the actors in their roles. There were a few discrepancies; but not many. I enjoyed the way the book was narrated throughout by "Death" - what an interesting perspective. I would highly recommend and it doesn't matter if you read the book before or after the movie. It did not spoil the book for me at all.
 This is a fantastic book for adolescents.  Not only can it be used in a literary class but also in history classes.  This book is about a German family, the Holocaust, befriending &amp; helping a Jew, death, Hitler, and so on...<br/><br/>The odd thing is that the story's narrator is death.  At first it seems rather odd but it is interesting how the author created this story.<br/><br/>It is well worth reading and will be beneficial in any of the courses that I will be teaching.
 The poetry.  The imagery.  Amazing story - one that those crazy, crap-for-brains neo-Nazis should be forced to read.  You know the ones:  they deny the Holocaust ever happened.  Actually, this book should be on every high school reading list so that war on any scale, but especially the scale of WWII, can never happen again.  I cannot wait to see the movie!
 Loved this! I think it is absolutely worth the read. A very different perspective, from Death's POV. I really enjoyed how he used color to describe emotion, settings, feelings and scenery. I am a painter, and I found this to be incredibly descriptive.  It is an interesting way to perceive the world around you, in color.<br/><br/>I saw the movie first, and so I had pretty high expectations, but it served to be better than the film, as books usually are. I loved the characters, the setting, the writing style, the whole sha-bang.<br/><br/>Worth every penny!
 I loved EVERYTHING about this book - the arc of the story, the development of the characters, the writing, the imagery...EVERYTHING.<br/>At first I was a bit uncomfortable with Death as the narrator but in time I got accustomed to it and later enjoyed Death's perception of the events.<br/>I know many books have been written about the Holocaust, but this one was so different and so moving.  It should not be missed by those of us who love Words.
 I was unsure about this book when I purchased it.  I had not seen the movie so I had no preconceived notions about the story.  As it turns out it was one of the best books I have read lately.  The story is sad/romantic/funny/tragic all in one.  It really made me want to see the movie so I can see how it measures up to the book.  I have already recommended this book to several people and will continue to do so.
 I could not put the book down. Brought back many memories from my childhood in a war torn country. Watched neighbors taken away who were Jewish or gypsies. My mother and I were also taken away but let go since we we just lived in a Jewish neighborhood. Found out I am 50% Jewish in the end as a 63 year old when my mother was dying. She never revealed my fathers identity. I was given another family name by the man she married.
 I actually cried in my dentist's office as I was reading this. That tells you something. I also had a hard time at first getting into this book. It was the voice of Death as narrator that caused my sputter, but once I submitted to the author's vision, I was absolutely hooked. This is a beautiful story of love, family, war, friendship and moral dilemmas. I can't wait for my son to read this.
 A grown up book with a 9 year old main character.  This is a beautifully written novel set in Germany during WW2 illustrating the ugliness of Hitler and his propaganda. The story describes the life of a young girl at the age of 9 through 14 and her experiences with life, friendship, death and war. Read it. You won't be sorry you did.
 This isn't a negative book review just advice you not to spend money on this extra feature.Its not worth it. Just watch the movie after you read it because the movie doesn't do this book justices.<br/>The actual story is so beautifully written and wonderfully detailed. The relationships the book thief forms also touch the reader. The unexpected &amp; insightful narrator is the perfect 3rd person for this job.
 This book is incredible. It's narrated by Death, but has heart and soul. I saw an ad for a movie release of this book. After finishing this novel today, I can't see any way a movie can do this work justice. When I was young I read "The Diary of Anne Frank." It has stayed with me my whole life. I expect this exceptional novel to do the same. Deeply moving.
 This is a long book but a good one. Reading about the Holocaust is not always enjoyable or easy but it did happen and there are so many aspects of it. This is a good one. A good German family trying to live their life take in a girl who needs a family. And a Jew needs protection. They were kind people whose lives are woven together.  You won't regret reading this book.
 At the surface, this book is a simple story of survival in Nazi Germany, but the Words and Language used to convey the story make this a brilliant, extraordinary, and poignant novel showcasing the power and transformative nature of language.  Making this book into a movie is just wrong. READ IT and use your mind to take you on a journey that images on a screen will never be able to match.
 Well...I had to read The Book Their for the summer because it was part of my summer reading list. I am going into 9th grade and let me just say this book was beautiful. I have to admit...I wasnt all that into it at forest. Its not the type of book I would read but I am VERY happy that I read it. It takes place during World War II in Germany in the little town of Moulching. I found the character Liesel to be very unique. She was independent but reliant.<br/><br/>This book was very good. It is a long book. Being 550 pages long...but if you read 100 pages a day you'll love it. I give this book 5 stars. Just<br/>..WOW.
 I am drawn to books about the Holocaust, strangely. This is a book unlike the others. Narrated by Death, l glimpsed insights into the human condition in new ways.  I fell in love with Leisle, Rudy, and most especially with Papa.  The characters are revealed in such a way that it seems sure I  knew them. Highest praise for an unusual, emotionally written story. It speaks true from the heart.
 Finally, a story that touches the true grey area of war....ordinary folks caught up in the rhetoric and nonsense of WWII.  Not everything was black and white....or was it?  It is a story that touched me and stayed with me for awhile.  In amidst of all that horror there was life and it worked very hard to resemble humanity.<br/>I seldom read a book twice....This was one of those times.
 It was for my freshman daughter to read in her AP English. The teacher loved the special edition so much she gave extra credit.
 Great book for teenagers and adults!
 This little gem is written in a unique way. At first you think WOW what is this book about, just push through and you will eventually get it. I never re- read a book but this one I did! As soon as I finished I went straight back to the start and started to read it again, Must admit I got a lot more out of it the second time around. It's a must read for everyone and I feel it should be a text that should be studied in school as it has so much in it. It is now doing the rounds of the family
 Love this book!  I haven't finished it yet (reason for only the 4 stars)  I am from Germany originally and understand exactly how this child is feeling.  I was born after the war but I lost some of my family during the war and have lost my brother and sister because my mother couldn't afford to feed all of us after the war.  Am still looking for my siblings.
 I listened to this book twice and am rereading portions because the prose is so wonderfully poetic. The characters are so well developed that I was completely invested in their lives and cried when they hurt and cheered with each small victory.
 Felt a strong need to read before seeing movie. SO MANY emotions expressed in this book. Far too many to count. Have read many from this time period, many true, and not. This now stands out as my favorite. Would recommend for others!! SO well written and like how narrated. Completely differently done than any other book I've read. PLEASE, READ!!!
 I loved this book.  Being British and born just as world war 2 was ending I heard a lot about the devastation of the London blitz. This book is about ordinary people trying to live their lives in Germany during the war. Although it is set during a brutal time and is about the plight of the jews, it is also a book about love.  I really wanted Liesel and Max to be together at the end but this was not made clear.  A wonderful book that stays with you.
 Recommended by a coworker a couple of years ago, I immediately bought it for my Kindle. I was not disappointed. I couldn't stop reading this enchanting, disturbing book. Since then, I've told everyone I know about The Book Thief, and I think all of those people have loved it. I want to wait awhile before watching the movie. I'm afraid of being let down.
 This is by far my favorite book that I've read in the last few years.  I chose it carefully after previewing it; even so, I almost wondered why when I read the first page after buying it. I'm so grateful that I read on.  I quickly became absorbed. The main character is a young teen named Liesel who is essentially abandoned by her parents, deposited near a small German town around 1939, and told to go to a particular address.  There she is taken in by foster parents in their 50's:  unassuming Hans, a part-time house painter and accordion player with whom she quickly becomes comfortable around and his more surly wife in a very poor family. A few more important characters, particularly the unseen narrator who gathers the souls of the dead and who is especially busy during this period when Hitler is head of Germany in the early 1940's. The grim reaper makes a variety of comments throughout the book - some sad, some even humorous, many almost poetic.<br/><br/>I loved this book because it has everything that I could ask for: a great story line and plot, wonderful writing that is often poetic, often unusual presentation that for me added to the book rather than taking away from it, and a range of characters that added interest but not so many that I couldn't keep track of them.  Let me explain a little about the unusual presentation.  Each chapter heading announced what was coming for the chapter.  Every once in awhile, large, bold letters would appear announcing something out of the ordinary.  That always peaked my interest. Also, because the setting occurred in Germany, German words were sprinkled around, with translations. A few sketches and so many wonderful phrases and sentences occurred - too many for me to quote that lent a very visual field to this novel.  Here are a few quotes: "They rustled up their thoughts"; "a rumor of sunshine stood behind the clouds"; "Ruined cases of buildings were piled up in mounds".<br/><br/>This is a story of Liesel, a young woman who initially could not read, yet loved books and stole them one at a time. She learned to read from Papa Hans who himself had had little schooling.  This story of her love of reading, some of the people who touched her and those whom she touched and influenced without even meaning to was very moving at times.  I fell in love with Liesel's innocence and tenderness.  By the end, I also felt much more compassion for what it would have been like to live in a country that was under siege that had nothing to do with many of its ordinary citizenry. And that could happen anywhere, including where I or any of us live. This can also be a story of all of us and want we want to do with our lives.
 The book is about a small German street near Munich and people living in it during world war II. But it's not any ordinary book telling the story from a German perspective and their sufferings during the end of the war. this book is narrated by Death itself and when you start reading it, it will probably run down chills down your spine. The heroine of the story however is a little girl who keeps escaping death and yes stealing books. Her love of books is not only ironical but most endearing and brings forth so many emotions, ideas and perspective into people's lives and human nature that it should be a study in itself.<br/><br/>All in all, it is one of the must-reads not only for young adults but for every person who values life, thinks war is a waste and wants to read something refreshing.
 I din't see the movie as often find the book so much better.  A young lady I could relate to as developed a love of ready at an early age thanks to a Mother who read to my brother and me from an early age.  The high point of the week was the arrival of the Book Mobile - another new world!  The terrible period of our world history was not the focus, but how this child learned to love the good that existed in spite of them.
 If one has never experienced a war, it is difficult to know the myriad of feelings and fears one would experience. The author of this book had that rare ability  to place the reader in an experience is such a way that one could carry the memories of the character's experiences as ones own. I doubt I will ever forget this book. It was deeply moving.
 I have never read a book that was written from the perspective of Death as a persona!.  This book was imaginative, informative, thought provoking, beautiful and awful at the same time, inspiring, and any other adverb one can think of to describe the particulars.  I highly recommend it for any age from upper elementary age on to elderly.  I cannot wait to read future books by this author.
 The story is compelling from the opening and grabs your imagination. I would say run  to your nearest bookstore and purchase but...Imagine enduring just one of the losses portrayed in this tale and overcoming. While a work of fiction, The Book Thief, puts a face to the suffering of untold persons who risked their lives to  stand apart from the tyranny of Nazi Germany. well done!
 A great book. You will not be disappointed. Especially the last parts, making emotions a rolling stone. Read and enjoy!
 A friend recommended I read this. I was not disappointed. Such an interesting narrator. I may read again as it was so engaging I read very quickly!
 I enjoyed the book and wanted to read it since did not get a chance to see the movie. The trailer in the theater looked interesting.  It might have been accurate to events in that time period but did not like the situations of course. I did admire the characters very much. Based on their circumstances, they were great in their actions and outlooks at the time and what they had to overcome.
 This book really captured me.  I loved  the concept the author used by having "death" narrate the story.  This is not a  “fast read” kind of book, even though I couldn’t put it down (and I’m typically a fast reader).  I took my time with this book because I wanted to savor the characters and writing style.  I have added this book to my absolute favorite list and it’s a pretty short list compared to the amount of books I read.
 So many emotions run through you as you read this amazing, horrific story of Nazi Germany. You fall in love with the characters and laugh and cry next to them as this story unfolds.<br/><br/>Not in a long time has a book made me leave behind everything else until I reached the end.  It will take a lot for another book to cause so much emotions and thoughts as "The Book Thief" has.
 One of the best books of any year. It's billed as a 'youth' read, but don't let that put you off. Especially if you're a reader, you'll fall in love with this book. Imagine being deprived of reading material! You also learn some things {obliquely} about WWII--and a lot about human nature. Besides that, it's a good read.
 As an avid lifelong reader of books, including work usually referred to as "youth fiction", all I can do is encourage all mature readers to try this book. Its narration by Death is one of its unique points, but rest assured this is not just some writer's gimmick. Its harsh power is so gripping I actually wonder at its recommendation for teens- they'd have to be pretty mature to take some of the depictions in this tale. I would highly recommend the book as a fictional counterpoint to Anne Frank's diary for mature teens reading about WWII and the Holocaust, driving home the idea that brave hearts and strong consciences were found even in Nazi Germany. The character of Liesel jumps off the page with the same life and vivacity as Anne. While there can be no direct comparison between a real person and fictional character, both  books convey the horrors of WWII through the eyes of the young. The Book Thief can also serve as a reminder as to how easily society can push us to overlook individual conscience for personal and financial comfort. The character of Liesel will live long in my memory as few characters have. This book is a real gem.
 the world needs to know that no good can come of war.  for all sides.  it also needs to realize the suffering for everyone. the people we considered our enemies are just as loving and hating as all humans are.  this book should be read by our children and grandchildren.  we need to remember the hollicost, but this book opens one's eyes to the suffering of all during war.  beautifully written.
 having been in the Dachau area and the interment camp it self as a tourist, it really brought home what they went through. Such a beautifully written book. I had delayed reading it as I was told it was for youth. It is for all ages. No one should ever have to go through what they went through and yet they found love and caring.
 I was required to read this book for my English 9 pre-ap class...and I wasn't very happy about it. I looked at the number of pages and thought', what a waste of my summer.' But it turns out that reading this book was not a waste at all. After each page I felt like I was really connecting with the characters. The pages pulled me in and told me to read more. The Book Thief is a beautifully written piece of art filled with romance, adventure, thrill, education, and more as you read through the main characters story and life and how she grew up as a foster child in the middle of World War II. I couldn't put this book down and I most definitely don't regret finishing this school book assignment. I loved it.
 WOW!  Not sure what I expected from this book, but what a good read.  Even in the very sad and depressing era the story was set in, Liesel Meminger was a breath of hope and determination.  The narrator was a surprise.  Really enjoyed this book.  Hope to see the movie and NOT be disappointed.
 I really enjoyed this book. It was so sad, but I loved the characters and loved getting to know them.
 I really enjoyed this book.  Granted, it was sad because of the time it was set in, but the characters were so likeable and so real.  Don't judge it by the first chapter or two.  It took me that long to get used to "death" being the narrator, but it really was a very different and unique way of writing the story.  It was one of those books I hated to see end.  Great book, a classic I think.
 I have been in Germany for several years now and I have often wondered how the things that happened during WWII could have been allowed to happen.  This story of one girl lays out the path and how some Germans quietly tried to do something.<br/><br/>Words left unchallenged can make nations into prisons with people blindly being led down a dark, dark path.
 I didn't think I liked historical novels, but this one blew me away.  If you ever wondered what it was like to live in Germany during the holocaust for the majority of the poor population... this is your book.  This book is narrated by death, which sounds gimmicky, but it works.  This book is heart-breaking and thought provoking, but not depressing.  It gives hope and explores love.
 This is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE book of all time!!! I've read it three times (which is unusual for me). Even though I know what's going to happen, I never fail to shed more than a few tears at the end. The characters and their relationships to each other are rich and realistic. You get a sense of their daily lives, sameness day after day, dreariness, poverty, fear, hopelessness. And yet the author adds details (the shape of a cloud, the feel of a book, a snowman in the basement) that become shining rays of hope, reminding you that life is worth living, even in the midst of evil, cruelty, and the worst that humans are capable of. Hope remains.
 We take words for granted but words have changed the world, inspired the world and saved the word. This book demonstrates the power of the word.<br/>I also liked the fact that "death" narrated the story. It gave a different perspective to the gathering of souls. I realized that bombs took numerous lives but the realization of 55,000 souls at once was amazing. A smile came to my face when "death" complained. "Death" has such an evil facade that the thought of "death" complaining made me smile. This book left me with thought provoking insight into WWII and its affects.
 I guessed early on in the prologue who was authoring the book, but prologue felt slow to us (I read aloud to my husband while he drives) and wasn't spiking our interest much. We kept wanting something to happen. When things started to happen, interest grew and now we're eager to get back to it - left in Chapter 2. I'm curious how the movie handled the perspective. Plan to watch it.
 This is an impossible book not to like. It features an orphaned girl, a love of books, a kindly stepfather, good Germans hiding Jews from the evil Nazis, and a budding boy-girl romance. The book is sad in places, depressing in others but it always comes back to an indomitable human spirit. Plus it utilizes one of the most unique narrators in modern literature. Don't miss it.
 This book is very interesting in which whom the writer has telling it. The realization of why he is telling this story to this day, still haunts the world in one way or another. This is not just about a book thief, a papa, a mama, a boy or a town. It is about life. Life and the way we live it. The paths we chose and those that chose us.
 The tone, voice, constant narration point keeps characters flowing. This book is going on the list among my most loved.<br/><br/>With so many book, movies, stories, historic text books documenting this horrendous time in human nature, this pulls at the heart strings. I watched the movie first, and was amazed. After finishing the book, they are similar but there is no denying how well told this story is.<br/><br/>Coming from an avid reader of all categories, this is over the moon recommended.
 Although this book is marketed as "young adult," older readers will find it very engaging and a worthwhile read. It isn't your typical World War II story. What I found most interesting is the voice of the child growing up in Nazi Germany and trying to understand what is going on around her and the hatred that is exhibited by some as well as the unexpected kindnesses by others.
 I almost put this book down after I started reading. It was unlike anything I usually read. I am so so glad I was intrigued and continued. I love the characters. They all have heart. The friendships developed have such meaning. Everyone can learn from the experiences of these people. Helps you to appreciate your life even more and empathize for those in tough life situations. Once I realized who the narrator was, my perspective of the story took on a whole new understanding. THIS is a well written and so descriptive story. It's hard to put it down.
 This book is an outstanding young adult introduction to the Holocaust and the evils of NAZI Germany. By centering on the destruction of books rather then people it allowed the reader to slowly adept ones sensibilities to the overwhelming loss of individual rights and and finally the humanity between people. The main characters jeopardy becomes more overwhelming and sinister as the story unfolds. Markus has created a well written page turner.
 Read this book and you won't be disappointed. In my opinion, this isn't a feel good book, but it's not all depressing either. It is sad, don't get me wrong, but it's set during WWII in Germany. What's not sad about that?<br/>It was hard to get the style of writing at first, but once I did, I couldn't put the book down. I love when an author can make me feel what the character feels. It's the power of words. This book book has it.
 I wasn't sure I'd like this book when I started reading it. But it soon caught me and I could not stop reading. The choice of the narrator was so much a part of the story. I also believe this is the first book I've read that chronicled the lives of ordinary Germans in WW2. Excellent book. I'd highly recommend it for readers who can deal with the reality of death.
 At my age (62) there are few books I go back to read again but this one is a must-read!
 The Book Thief was a page turner. Its simplistic language allows you time to feel the incredible pain and loss that Leisel endures throughout her journey into adulthood in Nazi Germany. I loved the juxtaposition of her foster parent's tough and oh-so-gentle love. In the end. though loss prevails throughout, the message of hope and survival makes the reader feel good.<br/>It was a charming book and I am recommending it to everyone.
 This book was a great read--a page turner with well developed characters in well drawn circumstances.  Even though it deals with unbelievable loss, it manages to convey hope.
 Every adolescent child should read this book. Extremely well written.  A very different style.  Great read BEFORE viewing the superb movie.<br/>Highly recommended. Probably would be a good idea to brief your young reader about the history and environment of pre-W W II Germany. A great adult read, too. No regrets here.
 An inspiring and difficult tale,<br/>With excellent character development and vivid language. However I found the choice of narrator awkward..
 Wonderful book in a unique style of writing. Thoroughly enjoyed. You come to love the characters and their shared experiences,  while learning more about the history of that time.  Highly recommend.
 I truly enjoyed this book. I won't give too much away but it is narrated by "death" and takes place in Nazi Germany, he is a pretty busy guy. You fall in love with the main character Liesel immediately upon meeting her and she draws you in closer for the entire story. There is so much heartache but so much more human strength, love and resilience in this story.
 This book was very well written and the author managed to keep it very interesting! It is a great story about Nazi Germany without getting too graphic.
 Bought this audio recording for my son. He had been assigned the book for sophomore summer reading--unfortunately it was the end of August before he attempted to read the book. I thought the "book on tape" would help him make good time finishing the story, and it did!  He did read along while listening to the CD's. I listened while we were driving together in the car. The narrator was incredible. He managed to convey the personalities of the myriad characters with subtle changes in his voice. Excellent story that deserves to be HEARD.
 At first I wasn't sure I would finish the book, but persevered and by the end I was very glad I hadn't given it up.  Clear picture of the life in Nazi Germany.
 I was recommended this book by a close friend and decided to give it a try.  For a while, I've been looking for a book that would take my breath away and with which I would feel something bigger than myself.  It took a lot of tries most recently but this book finally brought me what I needed.  The point of view from Death is the best way to tell this story from Nazi Germany.  You fall in love with the characters and see from the inside out of a horrible period of history.<br/><br/>I was reading that this is a "young adult" novel and, while it may be valuable to a younger audience, you cannot truly feel what comes through in this book unless you are a bit older.  I'm disappointed that some who are older might see this as a book below them, but it isn't and the message contained can sometimes only be felt by a more mature audience.<br/><br/>This book made me hope, it made me cry.  It made me feel something inside that only gets stirred by something this great.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to feel something and connect with something bigger, to feel meaning in a sometimes crazy world.  It shows the horrors of war and the power of individual human compassion in the face of evil.  It is the best book I've read this year.
 It's an intense story as you can expect because it takes place in Germany during World War Two at a time when the Nazi's came to power and were persecuting Jews and forcing young Germans to join the Hitler Youth Movement.  It's very unique because DEATH is the narrator and  the  book explores relationships among people.in a very poor neighborhood on outskirts of Munich.
 The spectre of Death loomed over WWII Germany, and no city or town was immune to the implacable gathering of souls.  "Death" is the narrator of this honest, objective description of the horrors of wartime starvation, destitution and inexplicable mind-twisting.  Yet the human spirit maintains humor, love of art, compassion and competitive gamesmanship through the characters Zusak has invented.  And though a bomb destroys Himmel Street and its residents, we are confident that Max and the "book thief" will be reunited when the war ends.  Finely nuanced, the novel is both a page-turner and a philosophical musing on the personalities that come to life on each page.
 The Book Thief was one of the BEST BOOKS I have ever read. When I first picked it up, I thought 500 something pages. Then I couldn't put it down and hated when I read the last page.  The Book Thief is a book that is well written. A masterpiece of literature.
 A friend raved about "The Book Thief" so I decided to read it myself. I was quite surprised to see that it was part of "Random House Children's Books," as the material is quite harsh in parts. However, I feel that my 15-year-old granddaughter would be able to assimilate its lessons on "man's inhumanity to man" as well as enjoy a good read. Most books present the facts from the point of view of the Jewish victims of the Nazis in WWII, but this quirky, compelling book gives voice to the suffering of Germans who did not agree with Nazism and were persecuted as well. (As a person of 3/4 German heritage, I appreciated this viewpoint. Not all Germans were "bad people" in WWII.) This book will help to keep the knowledge of the Holocaust alive in the next generation.
 Captivating enough to "feel" the lives of these characters... I love Liesel and Rudy. I  love the gentle accordianist yet i love mama who DID have a heart... Being Jewish  myself, Max is my favourite character - strong and bold in the end, undefeated!  Equalling  his life's lesson taught to the world, i admire this novel.
 I enjoyed reading this book. It took me a little while to warm to the theme but it was worth persevering.. Overall it gave a great insight into the characters who suffered through living through the Nazi regime of WW2 . The author has a different style of writing but he is successful with his particular way of writing. I ordered another book by this author as I thought he wrote a good story which held my interest throughout.
 I am an avid reader, and this is one of only a handful of books that was able to make me cry as much as I laughed; it took me on an emotional roller coaster. I recommend this to anyone who loves to read; old and young alike will love the journey on which the author takes the reader. Perhaps it is not appropriate for young children, as the war and death might be a little over their heads; however, anyone who reads will be able to see the beauty of this book.
 This book surprised me from the beginning as death, the narrator, began to weave a tale that I will always remember. The characters were as real as your own family members, but, as the book took place in Nazi Germany, during the most despicable and sad times in the history of mankind, I found myself mesmerized by the tragic ness of their lives. Amist the despair, was the sweet , beautiful story of this determined girl. The ending brought out emotions that even surprised me. This is definitely one of the best books I've ever read.
 Death, our narrator, is a conscientious worker, and we didn't know until reading this book that it was kind.  Kind, thoughtful, and extremely tired.  The characters construct themselves in our minds as if from smoke and sky into tendons, hair, bone, and life's fragile breath.  We don't fall in love with them while reading.  It's as though we always knew and loved them.<br/><br/>Each day we close the book once more, we suddenly notice the skies over us.  Why didn't we ever before notice all the colors of the sky?  Why has no other author painted the skies for us like this, ever, throughout human history?<br/><br/>I am a child of a Holocaust survivor.  I've been there, in life, in history, in heavily accented stories, in countless books of fiction and truth.  And yet this book brought me to a different Hitler's Germany, one that was fresh, equally ugly, but brand new to me.<br/><br/>I read a lot of good books.  There are many good books, and I enjoy them.  This one moved me like a disease into a state of synesthesia, beyond my senses into my emotions.  All my emotions fused, became one, and the secrets of life became known to me like they will the day I eventually die.<br/><br/>You might think, after reading this review, that you won't want to handle reading this book, but you will.  You will enjoy it very much.
 This book will haunt you and change you. It will tear your heart out, and yet feed your soul. A most worthwhile read.  Unforgettable.
 I liked the story very much!  As told by death,  I will never underestimate the power of the human condition.  Liesel will live in my memory for a very long time.
 "The Book Thief" is a story about a German girl during the bombings in her town in World War II. She and her friends learn how to get around, how to find food when the whole city was cut off from food supplies, and how to avoid the Nazis. It was an eye opening look into the non-Jewish world of ordinary working class people during war.
 Good book. Got a bit tired of the same part of the story repeating over and over. Could we just be done with the description about the little brother dying with one eye open and one eye closed. Creepy! I'm a tough critic and prefer classic literature. This was a fun, fluffy read. Not a lot of depth, interesting story, but won't be a classic.
 This book is one of the best stories I have ever read - there are so many things taking place and there are so many lessons to be learned.  The awful things that happened to the Jews - makes the hiding of one in a Germans home in their basement gives hope that there were many Germans that did not believe in what Hitler was doing.  A really GREAT READ.
 I thought the book was excellent. It took me some time to adapt to the writing style, and there were many tragic parts--as you would expect in a book set in Nazi Germany--but it was lyrical and had an original perspective. The "enhanced" version left something to be desired, specifically sound. I downloaded the Kindle version for IPad and the sound didn't work for the movie clips included.
 I have long been pulled to read fiction and non-fiction that told the stories of lives impacted by the horror of hate and war.  The Book Thief is one of the best!  Written through the eyes of death and a child, one feels all the emotions of joy and sorrow.  This book should be read by many, not just those interested in World War II; but by those open to seeing the mystery of life.  In all human situations, as ugly as they appear on the outside, one finds examples of love and kindness.  I highly recommend you read this book.
 You will think about everything differently after reading this. The world will never be the same and you will be forced to admit the truth : there is a fine line between all opposing forces; good and evil, beauty and ugly, kindness and brutality, strength and frailty. These pages force you not only to admit to this truth but submit yourself to it!
 Perhaps the best read of the year for me.  Everything works - character, plot, narrator, story, everything.<br/><br/>Do read it.  It's beautiful, wrenching, sad, exciting, terrifying, touching - you name it.  May be of special interest to readers with an interest in and connections with the Holocaust.  Zusak is a modern Dickens.
 I have read many books on the Holocaust but never one like this. It made me realize just how many Germans were treated if they let it be known they didn't like what Hitler was doing. So much sorrow and yet so much compassion as well. So many people in this world and we share so much. Can't we just treat each other with love and compassion. What a wonderful world it would be.
 There were times when I thought I would never finish this book. The narrator being "Death" bothered me greatly and still does a bit because it spoils many parts in many ways;however, the last 50 pages of this book are well, like Leisel, I struggle to find the words. It's like reading a story you know but seeing its soul for the first time. You feel everything Leisel feels and see the world as only she can. It's hauntingly beautiful. This is a story that I will not soon forget and I hope to pass it on to those people who love and hate words as much as I (and Leisel) do.
 I avoided this book for a long time, because I knew it was narrated by Death, and that sounded like a depressingly morbid proposition to me. I couldn't have been more wrong. Zusak's rendering of Death is one of the most likable narrators it has ever been my pleasure to encounter. In THE BOOK THIEF, Death is no black-hooded figure wielding a vicious scythe, he (it?) is a thoroughly decent chap. While he might affect a professional distance from the human beings with whom he comes into contact, the truth is that he is not immune to emotion. He tries to maintain a healthy lack of interest in what he calls "... the contradictory human being. So much good, so much evil. Just add water." He is pithy, sarcastic, and ironic at the expense of humans, attempting to caricature them to save his own sanity. But once in a very long while, a special person will break through Death's defenses and focus his attention on the curious creatures whose souls he escorts, sooner or later, from this mortal coil. One such special person is a little German girl named Liesel Meminger.<br/><br/>Death first encounters Liesel when her little brother dies on a train journey on which the children's mother has taken them to deliver them to their new foster parents. Liesel thus loses her brother as well as her mother, but after her brother's funeral, she finds something half-buried in the snow - a gravedigger's handbook. Not really knowing why, she steals the book and takes it with her to her new foster home. When she first opens it, a little bit of everyday magic occurs: "Amplified by the still of night, the book opened - a gust of wind." This begins a tangled web whose common thread is the redemptive power of the written word. You who are reading this, are you not a book lover like Liesel, like me? And if so, have you never been saved by books, like Liesel, like me? Then be kind to yourself, make Liesel's acquaintance, read THE BOOK THIEF.<br/><br/>Many other reviews have recounted THE BOOK THIEF's general storyline, so I will only say, briefly, that it is the story of a little girl growing up in Hitler's Germany during the Second World War, cared for by her foster parents, soft-hearted Hans Hubermann and his gruff but ultimately kind wife, Rosa. It is the story of Liesel's friendships with Rudy, the boy next door, and with Max, the young Jewish man hiding in the Hubermanns' basement. It is the story of the books Liesel steals - from graveyards, from Nazi book burnings, from the library of the mayor's wife - and the comfort they bring to Liesel and, occasionally, to her friends and neighbors. THE BOOK THIEF covers many important themes, most notably death in all its forms - from dead brothers to dead sons to dead letters - as well as the struggle for survival, survivors' guilt, secrets and lies, sanity and madness.<br/><br/>The content of THE BOOK THIEF's plot makes it a profoundly moving tale, and if anyone manages to make it to the end of the book without at least some spontaneous moistening of the eyes, they should immediately check themselves for a pulse. But THE BOOK THIEF is more than just a profoundly moving tale, it is an extraordinary work of twenty-first century art. What is it that tips the balance? What makes THE BOOK THIEF not just a great book but a masterpiece? It is everything that the book does differently. It is the narrator, it is the language, it is even the layout. But above all, it is the very different perspectives it offers of Hitler's Germany. And if this all sounds very serious, it's not - except for when it is. What sets THE BOOK THIEF apart is its playfulness ... And in the end, what turns it into a masterpiece is the juxtaposition of this playfulness against events of the utmost solemnity.<br/><br/>As THE BOOK THIEF's narrator, Death is, as I have said, unique in the true sense of the word, and in the best sense of the word. The reader's first encounter with his sense of humor elicits first jaw-dropping astonishment and then a growing sense of delicious wonder that eventually settles into an eager camaraderie. Early in the book, I found myself completely disarmed by such offhand but, to put it mildly, droll sentences as: "A bathrobe answered the door." As mentioned, even the layout plays a major role in the uniqueness of this book. The most important information throughout the book, whether it be the truth about the nature of Death as a supernatural being, the choices Liesel faces at crucial points in the story, or the meanings of derogatory German epithets, is presented in bold-type, center-aligned, compact, omniscient form (virtually dot points without the dots), which frees the rest of the narrative up to skip along and relate only the most poignant or most whimsical or most humorous events.<br/><br/>As I have suggested, the most important thing about THE BOOK THIEF is its unusual perspectives. By and large, we are used to reading stories from a human adult perspective. What makes THE BOOK THIEF initially so unsettling and then so enchanting is that this point of view is never offered. Instead, the story is told mostly from the non-human perspective of Death, who also takes into account the child's perspective of the main protagonist, Liesel. Liesel is, after all, the special human child who managed to break through the narrator's emotional barriers and inspire him to want to tell her story. So it is only fitting that much of the book is turned over to the perspective of a child's wisdom. The plot of THE BOOK THIEF is, in fact, quite reminiscent of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. It is told, more or less, from a child's perspective; it involves a close friendship with the kid next door; Liesel is a plucky fist fighter like Scout; treasures are left for Liesel in a specific place (an open window); Liesel's "papa" fights a righteous but hopeless fight for a man condemned by the prejudice of the era; and Liesel is even made to read to an elderly neighbor. And just as Jean-Louise Finch gave us a child's-eye view of the unjust trial of a black man in America's Deep South in the 1930s, Liesel Meminger gives us a child's-eye view of Nazi Germany in the Second World War. But don't mistake a "child's-eye view" for a childish view - Liesel is even more canny and worldly than Scout is. Certainly, she reminds us that children have their own concerns, desires, failures, and triumphs, no matter what their political surroundings, so even at the height of wartime atrocities, when everything goes right for Liesel, "The day had been a great one, and Nazi Germany was a wondrous place." But at the same time, she knows full well what her beloved foster parents and her friend Max, the Jew hiding in their basement, are up against, and she knows: "You hide a Jew. You pay. Somehow or other, you must."<br/><br/>As well as making way for the story of a wise child named Liesel Meminger, the chunks of information scattered throughout THE BOOK THIEF are basically the narrator's way of saying: "I know what you want to know and are expecting to hear, so here it is. And now that we've got that out of the way, I can tell the story as I see it." And in making way for this story as Death sees it, we are given not just an excellent, moving plot but something literally extraordinary. One of the perks of being an immortal being, for example, is that you have a much more elastic sense of time, and Death uses this to great effect in telling Liesel's story. The constant stopping and starting of the story in the beginning is unsettling, but in a way, it matches how unsettled and fragmented Liesel is. As the story progresses and focuses, the narrative style settles and intensifies, too. In what we might see as Death's most audacious narrative act, but which he treats with calm nonchalance, he reveals, well before the event, when one of the story's central characters will die. While he says he realizes that readers may feel like he's spoiled the ending, that's not the important part, it's everything that happens in between that matters. Yes, the book comes complete with its own spoilers! But it is a sign of the author's brilliance that rather than, as the term suggests, spoiling the story, these revelations actually make it so very much more poignant.<br/><br/>Markus Zusak has done something exceptional with THE BOOK THIEF, something that has justly earned him accolades from one end of the world to the other, from critics and ordinary readers, from teenagers and octogenarians. In using such previously under-utilized and unusual narrative perspectives, he has allowed himself the scope to really play with language, with narrative, and with story. And in creating such a unique narrator, he has been able to share with us whole new concepts of life and death. Yes, Death displays a razor-sharp wit, a finely honed sense of irony, and an always-surprising sense of humor, but in the end, it is his moments of stunning solemnity that I will never forget. As Liesel is watching a group of Jews being force-marched along the road to Dachau, Death quietly mentions: "They watched the Jews come down the road ... many of them would die. They would each greet me like their last true friend, with bones like smoke and their souls trailing behind." And when Death can no longer evade the question of what he really thinks of human beings, he says simply: "... I'm always finding humans at their best and worst. I see their ugly and their beauty, and I wonder how the same thing can be both. Still, they have one thing I envy. Humans, if nothing else, have the good sense to die." I wonder if anyone will disagree with me when I say that writing like that is only found in a masterpiece.
 Beautiful writing. Not an easy read
 I had started the book once before and wasn't immediately captivated; I then decided to try again and was reading it voraciously, the second try. It is a quite interesting book with the narrator being whom he is. I would encourage readers to pursue it with a little patience, initially. BTW--upon completion, I immediately rented the movie and per usual--it was not as good as the book---but I did enjoy the movie, also. It was well done.
 Historical Fiction at it's finest!  What an intense book.  This book will forever be at the top of my "favorites" list.  The characters, the plot, the conclusion....so many great aspects to this story!!!!!!  If you love historical fiction you will love this book!  If you don't love historical fiction but love a great story, you will love this book!
 A master piece. Time and time again I have fallen in love with the book thief. No matter how many times I read it, I manage to find things and understand them more than before.
 Unusual start but wonderful story and some history, too!
 It's been a while since I have read a book that I could not put down . "The Book Thief" kept me glued to the pages and when it was finished I thought about it for days after. The characters were so real that I missed them and still have thoughts of them. I rarely reread a book but I will definitely read this one again.
 This book explores the complexities of human nature using "Death" as a narrator. It is beautifully written and touched me deeply. It shows the ravages of war on everyday lives and the complex way people respond to their stress and fear. It shows that loves crosses boundaries and fear and hate can bury our humanity. I loved this book and highly recommend it.
 If you are deadened to the stories of the Holocaust, this book will take you to a different perspective and a personally haunting narrative of war, loss, suffering and human endurance and hope. Read it and weep with joy for the beauty of humanity and a writer whose prose shape a world of suffering in a new and radiant light.
 My god, where to begin? This may go down as one of my favorite books of all time. I am very surprised it's considered a YA novel as I believe it lessens the brilliance of this book. My all means, do not let the YA category stop you from reading this. It is a dark novel for sure, but it has a beautiful story of family, friendship, love, growing up, and finding yourself all interwoven into a WWII background. It is so hard to find books like these any more. I highly recommend it for all readers, young or old.
 I liked the book overall.  It did drag a bit in the middle. The ending was ok. Probably won't be a very memorable book for me. However, in all fairness, when i read the book, i didn't realize the book was for young readers. I'm 50ish. Maybe that is why it was just ok for me.
 Excellent book!!  A novel approach to the story.  I have read many books concerning the holocaust and that time in Germany but never one with that perspective.  When I realized who was narrating the story it made it more pleasurable.  Such a steady unbending perspective on human-kind surely points to the fact that death has no favorites and, in the end, can't be altered.
 Being from Europe and knowing my German, I realize that a translation of the German words are necessary. It's well done! The book flows well, and one just wants to keep turning the pages. I enjoyed reading the book, but will not see the movie because I think it's too emotional. The scenes are depicted with so much detail, that I can picture it in my head. A very good read.
 This story wS hard to put down!  Death as the narrator was intriguing.....wanted to know what he would reveal and where we would go next.  So wanted Liesel to Kiss Rudy!  Such sweetness amidst the horror and tragedy. Poignant....I will definitely recommend.
 Wow. What people go through and how to survive both physically and mentally during dire times . It's haunting
 I just read this for the book club I am in.  I thought this book was absolutely fantastic.  It was a little slow getting into it, but after a few chapters, when I figured out what was going on (narrator/plot/writing style), I just flew through it.  I ended up loving the point of view and way it was written.  Very powerful!  The message, the story, the historical significance.  I would say this is a must read for pretty much anyone!
 Because I love to read and this book kept me interested to the very last page!  At times I had to stop long enough to let my mind absorb all the Book Thief was trying to share with the reader.  I also liked that this was set in another time period and because I have a friend who survived the German invasion into the Netherlands, I was prepared for the emotions this family lived.
 Sentimental rubbish with obvious characters, most of which were stolen from Great Expectations.
 I was looking fo a relaxed read with some Excitment this did not disappoint. I read it with my granddaughter we had good discussions.
 The Book Thief is so well written with a gripping story of deep love, loss and sorrow.
 I did not know what to expect with this book. My wife read it all the way through and I read probably about three quarters of it before I put it down. It at times was very depressing talking about war and it's ravages on different societies. Especially on the little girl.
 An incredibly fascinating and beautifully executed POV turns a great story into something so far beyond that. W-O-W. Also, that is probably one of the best last lines of a book I have ever read. Wow. Just wow. Phenomenal stuff.
 Was able to see the movie of "The Book Thief"  and so wanted to also read the book which had been recommended to me. Love that I can pick it up at anytime and the Kindle Fire has my place ready to continue reading the story. I can see why it was a Times Best Seller and I am not even finished reading it all as yet. Very cleverly written from a different perspective and it still holds ones interest in each chapter. Very insightful information about a family during the hard times of WWII in Germany. Makes one very thankful that we live in this free country and have the rights and choices we do today. Excellent reading!  Am recommending the book to all my friends.
 I was profoundly affected by this book in two ways--the reality of the story and the amazing beauty of its language. If you write, you must read this book. If you read, you must read this book. I read passages of this book out loud to friends for the sheer poetry of it. Liesel's story underscores the tenacity and fragility of life during war. From the common place to the absurd, you will get to know each character and be sucked into this world until you can't stop reading--wanting to know what happens next. Have patience with the beginning--the convention of Death as narrator seems odd at first. You will also, most assuredly, need a box of tissues in some parts--Liesel's losses will bring out the echo of any losses you may have had in your life. Excellent read. I highly recommend it.
 One of the best books I have ever read; both in writing style and story.  Thought-provoking, to read perspective of ordinary German people caught in Hitler's horrendous war.  Sad but not depressing; a book that will remain with you long after you have finished it.  Recommend it highly.
 The narration was so good.  I constantly found myself forgetting who was actually narrating, and for this book that was a good thing because it drew you into the story more and more.  The first half of the book started of a little slow, but once it got going I found it hard to stop reading.  Now, I can not wait to see the movie!
 This is almost an historical novel as the background of the holocaust takes center stage. It's very interesting because it shows how the Germans suffered during that time. Obviously they didn't suffer like the Jews did but it shows their humanity. Not everyone was going to Hitler rallies like the movies show.
 A wonderful story of love and devotion set in Germany during the Holocaust. Although set amid the destruction and death of that time in history, unforgettable characters and a deep love of their fellow man and books will make this a classic for our generation. Although a knowledge of german is not necessary, there is rich symbolism in the names that adds to the tale.
 I am in awe of every single word,every single line and every single story in this book. A true story teller, Markus Zusak`s deserves all the praise he has received for this and so much more.<br/>A true reminder of the horrors of the holocaust and the hope that one small person can do for another in the darkest of hours.
 I enjoyed this book from the first sentence.  I normally don't read books about the Holocaust period because I find the subject matter hard to deal with.  This one was, as one might expect, a bit depressing at times.  It reads like a foreign film - slow, but filled with twists and turns that lead to an existential ending.  Being a book lover like the main character, I identified with the main character.  Books take us to amazing places and this one was no exception.
 At first I had trouble reading it, but after the first two  chapters I was hooked. It is beautifully written with so much love. I found it warm, funny and heartbreaking and also it somehow gave a perspective to the second world war in all it's horror but also fragility, love and compassion. The narrative  by death is also, though sometimes harsh, very profound and gentle. Amazing! I can truly say I fell in love with this book.
 Now, this is what good literature is about. Heartbreaking, tender, funny, and surprising. I couldn't put it down and wanted it to on forever. A completely different look at what WW II was like, from a completely new perspective. Highly recommend!
 The best book I have ever read.  I could not put it down though many times I reread the chapter I had just finished.  I didn't reread for clarification but because I was simply unable to continue without living awhile longer in that chapter.  All readers should read this book.  I do not believe you will read it only once and I do not believe you will forget this book.
 We take our books for granted, but not Liesel.  This book, though a bit slow in places, was so beautifully written that I have a new appreciation for the words that make up this story and many others.  Until recently, I could not call myself a reader, but with this and many other recent readings, I am among the blessed.
 So well done , sharing the heart ache and the good and bad of the hard times in WW2.<br/>So well fine fell in love with the characters , wish it could have gone on!<br/>I felt sorry for those who only saw the movie the missed so much! What a shame this book is so beautifully written<br/>Hats off  to Mr. Zusak
 Plot builds slowly
 I will never forget the story of Liesel who wanted to read books so badly she stole them and how her reading kept people calm in a bomb shelter and how words ultimately saved her. It was inspiring for me to read about Germans who did not agree with Hitler and who were brave enough to do something different.
 This was one of the best written books I have read.  The simplicity of the story and the intricate sub stories were amazingly beautiful in their meaning.  The moral decisions and the Evil Minds and actions of others were all done so well.  I am going to recommend this to our 8th grade reading teacher,  as she does a unit on the holocaust. Wonderful.
 At first, while reading "The Book Thief", it made me too sad to really enjoy it.  It was a stark reminder of how horrible human beings can be to each other.  The realities of what war can do to the hearts and souls of the living was devastating.<br/><br/>But then we discussed the story at my book club and I was transported to a different feeling.  The glory of the human spirit in the midst of adversity, the ability of words to transport even the most desperate of situations to another place, the power of love to transform a broken heart, all came to the forefront.  What a gift!  I would recommend this book and would encourage the reader to discuss with others!
 Still reading but this book is written in the most interesting way.<br/>I've never read a book like this one.<br/>I'm really enjoying it, it's sad, its funny and written from a childs perspective.<br/>Had I known it was about the second world war from the German perspective, I probably wouldn't have bought it.<br/>But it's actually very good.
 At first it was hard to understand the story line, but after about 50 pages I really started to get into the book and it was hard to put it down.  I really liked the descriptions the author gave to each scene.  I did not like the fact that death was the narrator of the story.  Although, it did give a certain depth to the story line.
 I really liked this book.  At the beginning I was thinking that it would be a long 550 pages.  But somewhere around page 100, I got cause up in the story and spent several afternoons just reading the book.  Death, the narrator, was quite interesting.  In fact there were two places where he said something so spot-on that I marked the pages (something that rarely happens.)
 The work is fraught with disturbing images and towering vignettes. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a fuller understanding of Germany during the holocaust. The book is written from the point of view of a young girl whose innocence brings an interesting narrative scope to this work of fiction. She is so wrapped up in the books that she steals that she can't see society crumbling around her. The only reason this work doesn't get five stars is that the ending was a bit predictable. Overall, however, this work is a tour de force which should tingle the spine of any enterprising reader. Andy.j.lamb@gmail
 The book was slow and a little difficult to get into but was good.  Lots of pain and strength of character.  Very real. Beautifully written.
 This has been reviewed well enough in these pages that I will not go too deeply into it.<br/><br/>It is a very good book.  The language is beautiful, the use of foreshadowing and introduction of characters and themes are very expertly done.  Use of death as the narrator extremely novel and interesting and it works.  It deals with a very difficult and much mined territory very effectively in an absolutely new and interesting way - it is humorous, and profoundly moving.  My only gripe is with its being marketed as a book for kids.  I think it is a book for everyone older than say thirteen.
 Who knew that Death could be considerate, insightful, and compassionate?  A unique perspective of German life during WWII.  This book is sometimes hilarious, sometimes sad,sometimes angry, but enjoyable throughout.  One of the best books I have read in a while.  I laughed and I cried.  This is a beautiful book appropriate for everyone.
 This should be a must read for all higth schoolers.  It certainly gives you an up close view of what it was like, especially for Jews, in World War II.
 I highly recommend this book. I concur with so many of the five star reviewers comments that I have nothing to add.
 Great experience with this seller.<br/>I have been so influenced as a history buff by this period and the stories of human greatness that inspired these wonderful works of historical value that I felt it was important to have and read this book.  Then pass it on so that younger generations understand that these things must never happen again.
 Very unique set up to this historical fiction story. At first I wasn't sure about the narrator's 'voice' but I was won over and then didn't want the book to end. Wonderful story, so glad that I read it!
 This book has a style all it's own.  At first, the different style was distracting, but it wasn't long before I caught the charm of it.  WWII Germany is not an easy subject to write on or read about but Zusak accomplishes this with much grace. It is a beautiful and compelling read.  The characters within the story are dynamic and their development throughout the story is defined in a real and tangible way.  One could feel, smell, and see them as if they existed in the real world. This has classic written all throughout it.
 Loved this book.  My daughter purchased it and suggested I read it as well.  It was written in a way that one chapter flowed into the next and I didn't want to put it down.  Historical content that sheds new light and surprisingly pulls you in to the story.
 this was recommended to me by a colleague. I found it hard to get into in the beginning, although it has a great visual story telling style. By the second chapter I was hooked. Finished the book on a plane, cried for the last few pages. I have a few highlighted passages that still give me goosebumps
 Loved this book.  I read it before watching the movie, and I probably wouldn't have understood the movie if I hadn't.  The movie was very good, too.  I had seen the preview and pictured Leisel like the actress that played her, and all the other actors in the movie were similar to what I thought they'd be.
 Good story. Well written. Very emotional about terrible times
 I join the myriad of fans of this book and the novelist. A brilliant book. It won me from the start with its original concept of having Death as a character, the narrator. Look, what can I add to the accolade already deservedly poured on this book? This book has claimed a place amongst the great classics of literature. Read it. Gift it. Share it. It is brilliant.
 This book caught my attention by the way Zusak choose the "Narrator" of the story to tell the story.  I appreciated the Narrator's personality, if you will, and worldview.  The story is completely believable, the characters grow as the story moves forward, and seeing the probable ways of staying alive in German occupied countries gave more insight into the times.
 I loved this book - which was read for my book club.  I saw the movie before I read the book.  Typically not a good idea. It followed the story line fairly well and I could picture the characters as I read the book.  I loved the main characters - Papa, Mama, Liesel, Rudy &amp; Max.  The perspective - from the narrator, the Grim Reaper -  was from inside Nazi Germany and how people opposed to Hitler had to hide those views or suffer for it.  These characters suffered anyway, yet had so much love for one another. Liesel's love of books started with her brother's death, but grew with her father's help and Max's appearance.  I would recommend to anyone!
 There have been a lot of interesting books about living through WWII.  The Book Thief is another one.  It is an easy read and although tragic in parts, it is very interesting to read about life in Europe during WWII.  Those of us living in the United States during this war, cannot imagine the life Jews and other Europeans led during the war.  This book tells the story of some of these people.
 It was strange at first because you don't know if you'll like the Death character narrating this story, but you soon become dependent on him for every morsel you find yourself craving about the others within theses pages!  You get to know them well and find this book one you can't put down.  Death speaks poetically and yet human-like.  Kudos to the author!
 If you looked at my bookcase, you'd see dozens of books that have one commonality: the Holocaust. The majority are from the same perspective of a camp victim, but this one opens your eyes to a German family in opposition of the war. Death's role in the book really took it to the next level, using colors to portray emotion.<br/><br/>Words can't really explain how this book will make you feel, but it's one you should experience, without question.
 It's a tragically beautiful story. It starts beautifully tragical, with the silent death of a boy on a train and nightmares. It becomes beautiful, with the silver eyes of a man who played the accordion and a boy with hair the color of lemons. A snowman, a sketchbook, words painted on the basement walls. It goes tragic, the melody of bombs, a kiss, goodbyes. It ends tragically beautiful, with a soul, reading the little black book she left behind so many years ago.<br/>It's a story of fear, of courage; of love, of hatred; of war, of peace; of words, of silence; of death, of life.<br/>It will shake your heart.
 After reading this book, it took me two weeks to fully digest what I had read.  What is this book about?  Is it a book about war?  Is it a historical book?  Perhaps.  But ultimately the book is about choices.  When evil assails a family from every side, its members are forced to decide whether to conform or resist.  The Hubermans are not a perfect family, but when faced with the choice to accept a foster child whose mother is in prison, or to honor a promise to a friend, or give a crust of bread to a starving prisoner, they always find themselves making the unpopular choices, the choices that seem to bring them ever closer to their demise.<br/>Death, who narrates this tale, notices Leisl (foster child of Hans Huberman) and records the story of her struggles and those of her foster family and friends.  This is a well-written and thought-provoking book.  It is one of the best in holocaust literature for young adults.
 I read this book and it was a great read!  The more I read the more into it I got.  It didn't take long for me to finish this book as I couldn't stop reading it, wondering what was next. I have now purchased the movie as well.  I am NOT disappointed in this book at all. Infact I homeschool my children and my oldest one is reading this as well.  Very well written book!
 A very complex but enjoyable novel, giving the reader an inside look at World War II Germany the through the eyes of a poor family and a little girl fostered by that family. There were many emotions but the overshadowing thought for me was if the Nazis realized what they were doing to their own people.  I was thoroughly entranced and would high recommend this novel!
 The Book Thief was an amazing book because it was thrilling, shocking, confusing, and sad. This book was thrilling because there's a lot of excitement and pleasure in this book like when the bombing happened in Himmel Street and when Liesel stole books. This book is shocking because there are a lot of unknown things that happened unexpectedly. There are very surprising to the reader. This book is confusing because there is changing settings, different topics, also there are things that are hard to understand, but it makes you want to keep reading. Finally this book is sad because people get killed; there is a lot of bombings and death. This book was the best book I ever read, this is a book recommended for everyone and a must read for all!!!!  Review by,  Jayline, 6th grade
 The writer did a wonderful job of introducing each character and their connection to the main story. In some books you have to go back to review to remind yourself of who someone is; in this book I did not do that even once and I really felt like I connected with several of the characters personally. It is written dieting the war but it's not really about the war as much as it is about this little German town and it's residents during the war.  The book kept me engaged throughout, and did not disappoint at the end.
 I could have done without all the cursing. The beginning was plodding and slow; the characters were flat. Deeper character development would have added layers to this story and made it much more interesting. The only one I really empathized with was the narrator, "Death".
 Death is the narrator of "The Book Thief" by Markus Zusak.  Death makes a running commentary as he/she (yes, both)  picks up souls all over the world but returns again and again to a small town outside Munich during WW II.  He's especially interested in Leisle, a foster child, who's placed with an accordian playing father and a mother who replaces talk with cursing. Liesle plays street soccer, scraps with the boys to establish her place in the rough neighborhood outside Munich and finds strange solace in stealing books as she learns to read after the death of her brother.  Her life is impacted more profoundly when her foster father hides Max, the Jewish son of a WW I friend, in their basement.  Max stays sane by painting over the pages of "Mein Kamph" and painting his own story.  Leisle too begins her own book and her love affair with words. Death kindly gives us bold print synopses of what's to be.  This amazing book chronicles the strange loves that keep people sane during insane times.  (Does anyone proof this for spelling?  Please do)
 When I first started this book, I thought I would not be able to get into it; but next thing I knew I couldn't put it down.  Beyond my expectation.
 I wasn't sure I wanted to read a book about Nazi Germany, but I was surprised from the start when "death" turned out to be the narrator - but instead of being dark and evil, he was a pleasant (even gentle) character. This was a very interesting and thought-provoking book and was constantly surprising me with unexpected insights. There was so much life and hope even in such a dark period of our history.
 Perfect gift to add to my 12 year old daughter's personal library. One of her favorite books marked by its 10 year anniversary edition. Crisp and intact white hard cover copy.  Ready to wrap!
 This is one of the most interesting accounts of what war was like for the poor people caught up in it ... Regardless of which side you were on, it makes you realize that even the enemy people had a terrible time during the war.  The way it was written was strange at first, but once I realized who was narrating the story, I could wait for his next 'one liner' to come out.  Wonderful wonderful book.  Thank you for writing it, it's one I will never forget .. Right up there with The Kite Runner.<br/>Alison Young
 I loved this book, it was amazing! I think I have never cried as much with any book or smiled so much for that matter. I really connected with the characters and now I feel like I know them personally, I believe that is one of the most important things in a book... Of course, it is sad, but it is wonderful and, in my opinion, the tragic tint just makes it more beautiful.<br/>I recommend this book to EVERYBODY, even if you watched the film: the book is so much better (please notice how Arthur Berg is ignored in the movie...)
 I have witnessed Death taking  persons near and dear to me. I still see them in my dreams at night, and their souls remain in my heart. I have met Death myself, face to face, but for reasons beyond my understanding, he/she has decided to return for me at a later time. Perhaps it is because I have unfinished business in this world -  a thirteen year old daughter who still needs me and her mother to help her to grow and understand the complexity, and beauty, of the human existence. I hope that some  day she will be as wise and loving as Leisel Meminger. This book, more than any other, has given meaning to my life.
 I've realized that there are three things that make me love a book...I definitely need all three, but there is a clear hierarchy of importance: characters, plot, writing style. And Markus Zusak displayed a wonderful use of all three in The Book Thief.<br/><br/>Characterwise, Zusak made an interesting choice when he decided to use Death as the narrator of this book. He did a great job of making it seem like Death was just carrying on a conversation - almost like we were old friends. I also really loved the male-female relationships throughout the book. The main character's relationship with her foster father is absolutely heart-wrenching. I can't even really put into words how I felt when reading about their interactions. Just overall amazing-ness.<br/><br/>The plot was also very interesting. There were several unexpected twists and turns, which kept The Book Thief from becoming just another fictional WWII story. I find that I'm often drawn to these types of books (another goody is Sarah's Key), so it fit right up my alley.<br/><br/>In addition to all this, I really liked Zusak's writing style! He displayed an amazing sense of the power of adjectives, especially in using color to describe typically non-colorful things, such as emotions and words. For the most part, his writing style was what I would describe as "casual". I think Zusak understood that he had an great novel on his hands and didn't let unnecessarily fancy writing get in the way of the story.
 This story probably needs another title. I was disappointed that the movie version did not play well in theaters. It is a great book which lends another ray of light to life in Nazi Germany and how Hitler's madness affected ordinary people, how they coped, what they thought and felt, and how a young girl survived - one out of many who didn't - and lived to an old age.
 This book is a "must" read because it opens up the human spirit in all of us.  We know what is right and wrong, but are less likely to act upon our intuition.  This book brings out more about the holocaust than just a Jewish perspective, but more of from the average people that had to deal with the Nazi invasion...all through the eyes of a little girl.
 *The Book Thief* is narrated from the point of view of Death, and follows the life of Liesel Meminger, a young girl in pre-WWII Germany who has been taken in by a couple after her mother can no longer afford to take care of her. Sorrow, poverty, and abuse form much of young Liesel's life, but even with all the tragedy, there are amazing moments of love and beauty and the resilience of the human spirit. Zusak's writing is gorgeous and visceral. I just wanted to drown in the prose. The story is told in an unconventional, often nonlinear fashion, and it's fresh and original.<br/><br/>The subject matter can be bleak, but Zusak manages to imbue the bleakness with beauty and hope. This is a book about the grittiness and fragility of life, so precious even in its mundaneness, about how one person's bravery and selflessness in the face of evil and corruption can change an entire life.<br/><br/>I was incredibly moved by the book and sobbed through the last chapter. I was left feeling drained yet so lucky to be alive, grateful to have let this book into my soul. This is easily one of the ten best books I have ever read.
 Did not grip me, but I did finish it. I like books about WWII and the holocaust, but this one is overrated in my opinion. Might watch the movie, but I do not have great expectations. Very fragmented, somehow did not convey the utter horror of the situation. Death narrating it is a very good idea, but still it is not 'mauling your soul' as other books do with similar topic.
 I send books to a relative incarcerated in one of the nation's toughest prisons.  When he finishes reading them, he passes them on to others in his block.  Previously, the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, et al. kept them guessing as to each book's conclusion.  This week, though,  I learned that it is The Book Thief which is having a startling effect.  My relative writes that his two fellow readers have finished the book also, and one confessed "that certain spots made him 'emotional"".  This inmate had also discussed it with the second one, "who confirmed that he had to set the book down a few times because he felt the same."  !!!  I read this book on a weeklong backpacking trip this summer, and tore it in half (sorry, book) when I got partway so my son could start reading the book.  He hates fiction, but enjoyed this.  So, whether you are a regular mom, a teenage boy, or a supposedly hardened criminal, you can be moved by this book.  I have sent many books to my relative, but this is the first one with such a reaction reported from his co-readers.  I hope I will "hit it right" again--everyone needs these experiences.
 A tale from Death's point of view, of love and dying and survival. You seldom read stories of civilians doing their best to just survive in the chaos of war, but this one illustrates the struggle with insight and compassion. It was definitely worth a movie, one for young people to experience with their parents.
 This is a poetic, heart wrenching, heart breaking, and heart lifting tale expertly told by an unexpected narrator.  The stark reality of Hitler's Nazi Germany is told from the point of view of a young German girl in a story so well told that it had as much of an impact on me as Wiesel's Night and Anne Frank's diary.  Now to find another great book to read...
 I wanted to read this book before seeing the movie.  The book is set in Germany during WWII.  A girl goes to live with a foster family after her mother is no longer able to take care of her.  She has a very special bond with the husband who teaches her to read.  She has a secret she has to keep in order to keep herself and her family safe.
 A must read! This book was very moving and leaves a lingering shadow even after it's over. Much, much better than the movie. I was Very happy with this purchase!!
 Sometimes I think that I don’t really want to read another WWII book, but there are so many good ones, so many perspectives. This is a great one.
 I loved The Book Thief! I was easily drawn into her life and those around her. It took a dark period in history and brought it to life through the eyes of several characters.  It showed just how sad life can be when division is allowed due to race, economics and religion. However, it gives hope that there are those that stand against the flow and love from the heart and not through the tainted glasses of prejudice!
 The author is an artist with words.  Descriptive phrases were astounding.  This novel looked into the lives of the common people in Nazi Germany.  There were those who did not accept Hilter's philosophy, but were fearful of the Nazi revenge.  The author took one into the lives of people who could not accept the Nazi wy of life, lbut to exist they had to pretend.  However, their pathos for humans was displayed by Hans as he laid the dry bread for the Jewish prisoners.  He realized what he had done and worried not for himself but for the ones he loved.  We, who lived in America, did not experience the falling of bombs on our homes.  This novel gave one insight to what the common people endured.  Mary P. Hallick, Ed.D
 I've almost finished the book and have enjoyed reading about Liesel and Rudy (and their families); 2 children growing up in 1940's Nazi Germany.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in reading about Holocaust history and this period of time.  I would like to comment on the picture of Liesel on this book cover as it doesn't fit my mind's vision of her.  This picture is a healthy, beautiful girl with plump cheeks.  Liesel was always hungry and not only was she a book thief, but a food thief at times.  They did what they needed to do during those hard years to survive.  Soup was all they had for evening meals and if they were lucky, bread with the soup.  (I'm thinking this picture is for the movie that has been released and Hollywood has "branded" this image for sales.)<br/><br/>I enjoyed this book very much and would like to read more of this author.
 An amazing book...from a fabulous choice for the narrator to characters that are worth caring about and a setting as dramatic as it gets. This book definitely ranks as one of my all time favorites.
 Purchased this book for my daughter's 7th grade English class. They spent an entire semester reading and reviewing it. She loved it and still has the book to read again eventually. What a great story!
 I finished reading The Book Thief a couple weeks ago, and am still haunted daily by passages and scenes from this story. It is a masterpiece of wordplay, and prose so elegantly arranged it is nearly poetic.<br/><br/>The story brings the reader very intimately into the lives of people living in Germany during WWII, most especially the life of a small impoverished girl, the likes of whom is unimportant to historians, undramatic to Hollywood, but one of a type who lived through the nightmare and survived it.<br/><br/>It is narrated by Death, who slows down in this very busy time for him to wonder at the small scrappy girl who's fondest desire was to learn to read and write. She tries in her innocent way to understand her world to the best of her ability, to make sense of the Nazi propaganda she is subjected to, and yet still find pleasure in her world, her friends, her family, and what's in the basement.<br/><br/>Much thanks to the author for this unique and wonderful perspective. I love these characters, and the story moved my soul in such a way that few other books ever have.
 Wow. This story of a book stealing girl in a poor German town during WWII will take a lot out of you. This is not a beach read. This is not a book to be taken lightly. But its one of the best books I've read this year. Zusak's writing is beautiful and smart, making this story a literally masterpiece. A must read for anyone who has the ability.
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The only reason it only got four stars from me is because it's a hard topic and so part of me was sad the entire time I read it. It couldn't be any other way really. The charming narrator, sometimes humorous, other times poignant, saves the story from becoming too heart-breaking. A must read.<br/><br/>I would like to make a note to whoever is responsible for making books available to Kindle - this note is obviously only for the Kindle version. The punctuation is atrocious! The Kindle version is obviously an OCR scan of the book, but there are so many full stops and opening and closing quotation marks left out it appears that no one proof read the scan before publishing it. I initially thought the author had some deep love of exclamation points, but it seems that often a full stop followed by a closing quotation mark (.') has been turned into an exclamation point (!). I am a bit of a stickler for this kind of thing, and it would be lovely if someone could put a bit of proofreading effort into the Kindle edition, but even this couldn't dampen this beautiful story for me.
 Stepson had to read it for school and even though he thought the story was dimm and dad at times he learned about the things that people went through during the world war and those through the Jewish persecution of the time.
 Loved this book. It was unique in that it wouldn't let go of me. While I was reading another book, The Book Thief was pulling me back to it. So do yourself a favor and read The Book Thief right now.
 Very different perspective of the lives of working class Germans under Hitler during extreme scarcity, Hitler youth, the destruction of the Jews and war.  A girls  prospective.  Ripped away from her mother and brother, traumatized, yet principled she is  thrown  Into a life with a volatile foster mother and incredible warm hearted papa in drastic times,
 What can I say about this book that hasn't been said. It is a modern  classic, just beautiful, well written and engrossing. It is a book that will stay with you.  I wanted to read this for a long time and finally did get a copy and could not put the book down and was sorry when it ended.  Others have discussed the plot.  I can only say, read it. Great literature.
 This fictional book was required reading for my grandson at his school. He pestered me until I bought it and read it for myself. My husband also read it. Then we discussed it with our grandson. This book was his first exposure to the Holocaust. It gave my husband and me a chance to discuss the greater historical issues contained in the Holocaust and how we can understand them today. It became a stepping stone to in-depth discussions. The schools do not teach enough modern history (from WWI forward) and this book became the impetus for us to teach our grandson much-needed lessons on history.
 Loved this book when I read it, and I was thrilled that my 16 year old granddaughter requested it for her birthday.
 Excellent book! So sad that it's not just a work of fiction!  We must Never Forget what happened to the Jewish people, so that it can Never happen again to them or any other Race or Religious population!
 I very much enjoyed The Book Thief. I had a very short time to read the 550 page book to complete it before my bookclub meeting. It was not a problem....it is a very quick read!<br/><br/>At our meeting we discussed the book and watched the movie. We all pretty much agreed the movie did not do the book justice at all. If we hadn't read the book first, we never would've understood the relationships, how they evolved and how deep they went.<br/><br/>Highly recommend the book, the move....not so much.
 The book grows on you, than after you have finished it grows on. A well told tale of  war time Germany with the characters you grow to enjoy and others... . The bombing raids, the false alarms and the real thing, children, teenagers and adults all have to endure their horror. Then their is a risk a kind soul makes, a risk to him, his family and the Jew he conceals. Read it.
 This book is amazing! I read it before the movie came out, so I was not tainted by the Hollywood version. It is one of the best books I have ever read. If you read one book this year, read this one.
 Captivating and told in a series of poetic metaphors that alleviates the need to describe the dreariness of the landscape and the hearts. And yet this black and white story does have its colorful moments to give it enough hope for humanity. There is one additional twist that makes this book even more interesting: Death is the narrator.<br/>Paule-Audrey
 I read a lot. This book is wonderful. The story of a young girl in Germany during world war 2. Both sad and uplifting at the same time. I like how the author uses death as narrator. Definitely a book you should read. Worth the time and money. Very different from anything I've read in a while. You'll be missing out if you like to read and don't read this.
 I really enjoyed this book. Using Death as the narrator, Zusak tells the story of a young girl (Liesel) in wartime Germany. She lives with foster parents, whose characters are richly described. Her Papa, the accordionist, dominates the story with his love and humanity. At great risk to himself and his family, he harbours a young Jewish man. Through this young man and the encouragement of her Papa, Liesel acquires a taste for reading. However, books are scarce. So she gets hold of them in various ways, as the title suggests. The tragedy of war fills her everyday life. One grows to love the characters.
 This book is charming.  The writing style is a bit unusual with Death being the story teller.  Patience required for the first couple of chapters.  Tells of a terrible time in Nazi Germany in the late 30's, but the story is told gently.  The truth is there, but author does a beautiful job of portraying  in sepia tones rather than under bright lights.
 Best book I have read in a long tome.
 I enjoyed this mainly for the reason it wasn't like a lot of books out there repeating the same format only changing things just enough to call it a "new book". Granted the period this takes place in was very dark and gruesome, yet you get a glimpse of basic survival from those caught in the middle. I liked it, and if you're tired of the same 'ol detective stories then you may find this a good read.
 Difficult to start, but learned so much regarding Germany during World War 11.  I understood Jews were treated badly, but did not realize the torture everyday families experienced. The goodness of Jewish families to take into their lives folks who needed shelter and care is not lost on me.  Our young friend of this book makes us understand how important books and knowledge are.
 Very well written book that deals with German children and adults during the years after Hitler led the country. It also deals with how Jews were treated and what happened if any were in hiding in a German home. It is definitely not for the faint of heart and should be considered only for adults and teens. At the end, you need a box of kleenex.
 I did not love this book, but I did enjoy reading it for the most part.  I liked the perspective presented by the little girl because the focus was not on the Jews during the Holocaust, but just a girl uprooted by war, living in a small town.  The narration is interesting at first, but I didn't care for it as I neared the end of the book.  I did like the "spoilers" in the book (I tend to read the end of the book somewhere around the middle just so I know what happens), and the book moved along at a good pace.  I read this for book club, so I will be interested to see what the other readers think.
 I sometimes read rave reviews here on Amazon and wonder if the person who read the book and wrote the review read the same book that I did.  In this case, the over 1100 people who gave THE BOOK THIEF 5 stars could not have been more correct. This is book is outstanding! It deserves every accolade that it has been given and I would like to thank the person who recommended it to me.<br/><br/>The plot is well thought out and the characters touch your heart as you can feel yourself sitting in the damp basement with Liesel and Max.  You can hear Hans playing the accordian and you can taste the meger meals the family eats.  You feel thier pain. If forces you to answer the question - what would I have done?  It is a story that you will live with for many years, if not the rest of your life.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I knew little of the plot going into the book. Watching the story unfold adds a great deal to the intrigue and the beauty of the tale. So I would caution prospective readers to avoid reading reviews that reveal too much of the story.<br/><br/>This book would be a great parallel read for students reading THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK.  It shows a different perspective of World War II and the conditions under which many average German citizen. It is about the reality of war.<br/><br/>In my book, 5 stars are not enough for this wonderful story of life, death, and survival.
 This book is amazing - one of my very favorite! The only thing I don't like about this copy is that the lettering is very small with a large white space around the edge of the pages. The story and writing itself? FANTASTIC.
 I was reading this to decide if it was appropriate for my 5th grade class. While I think it's a little heavy for that age range, I really enjoyed the book. It was beautifully written and the fact that it was narrated by 'Death' was really interesting. Especially because you develop a kind of compassion for the narrator throughout the book as well. It was heartbreaking but beautiful.
 This is the kind of book you can not put down.  A must read for all ages.  It really hits home if you are old enough to remember grandparents stories of escape.  Seems true to life, a little depressing at times, when you realize this really happened. Great book to keep it alive and pass on to next generation!!! Don't let it happen again.
 Really enjoyed the book. It is destrubing in some parts, actually extremely sad. Its terrible when children have to deal with death and war.  I wonder if the goverments ever really consider this. Truely the only was some of us survive is through reading. Takes us away to a better place.
 I have  read many books about Nazi Germany. Diary of Anne Frank, the Hiding Place, the biography of Dietrich Bonhofer, Night by Elie Wiesel and now, The Book Thief. The first three are true stories. Night has always held the top spot in my heart. This one is such a close second, it could almost be a tie for first.<br/><br/>Haunting story you won't want to put down!!
 11 year old daughter is loving her new copy of this book as much as I loved mine.  The story is fantastic, and this anniversary edition is in a great binding.
 The Book Thief is one of the greatest reads I've ever read. With a combination of beauty, happiness, pain, and hope, it tells an amazing story. Told from Death's point of view, Nazi Germany is plagued with tragedy, but with one girl, Liesel, life gets better. Though it's only one story of the millions that have been through the horrific events, it has vivid detail and a stunning storyline. I laughed and cried all throughout the story, and I felt so much emotional turmoil reading it. It has lots of foreshadowing, dark themes and lighthearted tones, but it's fantastic book. I think someone with a high reading ability would very much enjoy this book, but the language is good enough so that anyone could read it. Since the subject matter is very intense, there are some situations and minuscule amount of language that I would not recommend to 9-year-olds. I'd keep a box of tissues ready.
 Marcus Zusak has the gift for employing language in a startling and memorable way.The story is  compelling, dealing as it does with huge human events, the ways in which the iconic characters cope with these whilst attempting to not compromise their principles, and the heart wrenching consequences of choices made. I have not seen the film, and do not intend to, until I have fully digested what is to me more than a beautifuly told story. It is a work which poses confounding  philosophical qauestions dressed in powerful and evocative language. Death becomes a friend,one whose own mystery is remarkably explained as a sacred duty to be performed tenderly and compassionately. Zuzak does much to demonstrate how the German people shared the misery of the dreadful Holocaust as much as they instigated it. A truly beautiful book, the characters of which live on in the mind.
 While the book is about a young girl I don't see it being a young adult type book. There is some strong language and some graphic details.<br/><br/>The book was amazing! It is centered on Nazi Germany through the eyes of a German girl who doesn't understand why she is supposed to hate Jews.<br/><br/>Hard to put the book down.
 Shows how people can help each other endure terrible times.
 The Book Thief was excellent. I hated having to put it down to go to sleep, or wash the dishes, or go to work...It was one of those books that pulls you in. (I must say, the movie was so well cast. It was as though they pulled the characters straight from the book!)  The poetry of Zusak's writing is amazing. Sometimes I would read passages over and over to fully take in the  beauty of each paragraph
 It was a good book. I read a lot and this one had me from the beginning. There is a movie based on this book, but I have not seen it, and am not sure I will. I am often moved emotionally by what I read, but this one touched me deeply and when tears were streaming down my face, I realized that this would be a book I would read again!
 Beautifully written, with an "interesting" voice, a tale of Nazi Germany from the point of view of the common people. The ones who have little to do with the way a government chooses to act, but are strongly affected by those actions. Poignant, with its stories of lives searching for happiness, in spite of overwhelming odds against them.
 This story was an eye opener for me--had never read a book about a WWII German child--BRILLIANT!!! Loved it--want more. Death's POV was intriguing.<br/>So wish there was more to the story.<br/>The flow of the book was unusual but readable.<br/>I think I may have another favorite author.  Well done!  Bravo! Zer Gut!
 Not sure what led me to read this book but it was interesting in that it allowed me to imagine living in Nazi Germany.  The characters were sympathetic and the story believable.  It was very well written but with all of that it left me a bit sad.  It is a terrible thing when the population of a country are swept up into some fantasy concocted by an insane leader.
 When first reading I thought it was a bit young for an adult but when I continued on it was actually very complex.  There are relationship issues, loss, desertion, poverty, war and so much more.  I really like it and will read it again.  The book was better than the movie, but I enjoyed the main character so much I liked picturing her face as I read the novel.
 The writing was poetic. The story was wonderful. What a great book!<br/>I even loved the devils point of view!
 Leslie Meminger is an abandoned girl, living with foster parents in the poorest area of Nazi Germany. You will grow with her as she becomes The Book Thief.<br/><br/>Leslie Meminger's life will move you and make you shed some tears also. For me, Markus Zusak's descriptions are very much alive and made me be an insider of this story. I was there gazing quietly at them as the action developed.
 The story is very interesting but curse words are used throughout the story and I think that is what is keeping this book from a five star rating and the narrator is the Grim reaper and that makes the story quite interesting and the story takes place in Germany during World War 2 and that makes it even more interesting. I would recommend this book for lovers of fiction and nonfiction alike.
 The book was kind of boring, didn’t really get into the flow but the end is unexpected and enjoyable.
 If you want to know and feel how the people and times were in Nazi Germany, this book takes you there. you can taste, feel and smell the trials of the characters. I can't stop thinking about how the author put a certain character into the book. You will know what I mean when you read The Book Thief.
 My 14 year old son loved this book and devoured it in 5 days on a vacation.
 I couldn't stop reading it. I saw the movie first and although I loved that too, it was so incomplete compared to this. I would recommend watching the movie then reading the book. they complement each  other and fill in the gaps. truly amazing read. I am go to think about this for a very long time.
 This is my all-time favorite book. I finished a couple of months ago and am still raving about it to friends and family. Beautifully poetic, perfectly narrated (by the grim reaper), utterly sobering. You will feel the uncertainty of a young, abandoned German girl thrust into a poor and desperate family in the middle of World War II. Everyone over the age of twelve should read this book.<br/><br/>At one point, when I only had a few chapters left, I realized I was almost done reading the story and felt truly sad that it was coming to an end.<br/><br/>Read this book; you will not be disappointed.
 My friends all loved this book. I however could not get into it.
 When looking for a hard-back copy of this book in a local bookstore, I found it in the Young Adult section. But I think readers of all ages will be enthralled by the historical content and the colorful, insightful way Mark Zusak writes. This is history we cannot forget, and the unusual narrator of the book captures your attention from the beginning to the end.
 At first I thought it was to slow-moving, but the more I read, the more I enjoyed, right up until the emotional ending. The author took a chance using the narrator, I believe, but it worked - I won't give it away! I was completely engrossed at the narration. If you like World War II stories, and especially ones involving Nazi Germany, you will like this book. Give it a try.
 I loved this book! I’m not a big reader, but this book hooked me almost from the beginning. Definitely recommend reading!
 Just couldn't stop listening to this wonderful Book, everyone should take time to read or listen to this wonderful Book. One of my very very favor Book of all time.
 This touching book showed both the kindness of some people no matter the anticipated punishment and the cruelness and ignorance of others.<br/><br/>You will love the young book thief and her beloved papa.  Max will touch your heart and the Mayor's wife will make you feel sad for her and then feel a warmth due to her kindness to the Book Thief.
 Thanks for a awesome book
 It took a little getting used to the "narrator", but the story line was mesmerizing.  It shows that those in Germany who were not Nazis also suffered terribly with Hitler's reign.  Many books have been written about this period of time and we know the historical facts, but the personal stories of those who lived through it bring it alive to us.  However this book is not all gloom and doom.  Although touched by tragedy early on, Liesel had an adventurous childhood, finding trust, compassion, courage, and love, but if you cry easily, be prepared.  Now I must see the movie!
 This is a very detailed and well written story told by "death" during the early 1940's as Hitler's reign of terror is at its peak in Germany.  It gives a look at how ordinary Germans dealt with all of the "changes" and "promises" of a sick dictator. Funny, deep, sad and interesting, it is a short and good read.
 This is a very interesting book. The story is narrated by death so it took me some time to get used to the writing. but overall a great book a real page turner.
 The authors angle at writing this novel from Deaths point of view is unlike any book I have read. It actually made the reader feel sorry for Death. However, it did not take over the story but added the reality to this story and the time era of the Hitler ~ Nazi days. It can be a dark book but it truly captivates the reader into wanting to find out what happens to these characters in the story. It also reflects how humans care for one another even at the cost of their own safety. I could read this book again and find more depth in the story than the first time. I highly recommend this book.
 I am far from a prolific reader, but I've probably managed at least a few hundred novels in my lifetime.  There are plenty of reviews here which preview the story.  I'll simply state that this may very well be the best novel ever written.  As I stated to the person who recommended it to me, "I will have to punish you for recommending that book."  "Why? You didn't like it?"  "I loved it. It may be the best book ever written, but it is so painfully sad."
 Great book
 In the top 5 of books I've read over my considerable lifetime.  Absolutely unique and densely (but clearly) written.  I can't praise this book highly enough.  I cried and laughed and felt immeasurable sorrow.  I did not want this book to end.  I read this author's other books and they were all worth reading.
 The Book Thief is a very sad story but also it's about the triumph of the human spirit even when so much pain and death was experienced during WWII and what life was like in Nazi Germany at that time.  I also thought the narrative parts of the story told from the perspective of the empathetic character of death was very clever and heart wrenching.  This book was so good!  Now I want to see the movie more than ever currently in theaters.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading. You will not be disappointed.
 Such a well written book - artistic use of words. On my list of the best books I've ever read.
 Fantastic novel
 This is an incredibly touching book.  It outlines the lives of the people who really didn't want to become Nazis, but were forced by the bully mentality to "go along."  It's a very, very sad commentary on how a small minority can use force to silence the average peaceful citizen.  Probably a lot of this is currently going on in Muslim countries, where the majority of the people want peace, and a few do not.  (my opinion only, but it's hard not to see the parallels).
 There are many books written about the Jewish plight, Hitler's machinations, and lost children.  This book is unique due to the protagonist being death itself,  the inclusion of the German folk as victims as well and a string of hope.  Leisel and Rudy are terrific characters who provide much humor amid a terrifying story.
 Over the years I have read many books written about WW2 and in particular, the holocaust. I simply loved this book and was drawn into the story and the rich characters that were portrayed from the first chapter.<br/><br/>The author wove a very clever story using "God" as the narrator and occasionally flicking from the past, then the future and then back to the present. It held my curiosity the entire time and I literally read the book in one night.<br/><br/>I will not spoil the story suffice to say I am not usually a big crier but I sobbed my heart out and was deeply moved by the events that happened towards the end.  The story left me thinking for days and days after.<br/><br/>I will recommend this book to all of my friends and will also see the movie that has been adapted from the book. I hope it does justice to this most powerful book.
 Every time someone asks me if I can suggest a book for them to read, this book is the first one I can think of. This book.... my goodness. My soul feels happier having read it. There were moments when I wanted to put it down and walk away because the story hurt my heart but you keep on and in the end you are glad you did.
 I absolutely LOVE this book! I’m getting ready to have my 12yr old read it and can’t wait to see what he thinks!
 It's not often that upon finishing a book I want to immediately start reading it again.  However, with The Book Thief, I wanted to do just that.  I so completely enjoyed the way the story was told, and the characters themselves.  I wasn't sure what I was in for, a story of the Holocaust from the perspective of German citizens, but it was enthralling and at times delightful.  I fell in love with the characters and shared in their joys and heartbreak.  I was truly sad to get to the end, and look forward to immersing myself in their world again soon.
 Its not everyday that you finish a  a nearly 600 page book in a single day.<br/><br/>It's not everyday that you finish a 600 page book, and want to start rereading the book all over again....immediately.<br/><br/>It's not everyday that you realise that the most troubled times in human history can be an inspiration for most meaningful literature.<br/><br/>It's not everyday you read a novel in which the narrator is Death himself.<br/><br/>The Book Thief.<br/><br/>Story of an orphaned girl in Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>Recommended strongly. One of the most inspirational,  moving and poignant book you would ever read.
 The story of Liesel and her Papa is a beautiful story and one that will stay with me for some time. Unfortunately, I found the writing to be odd and distracting. I might even say pretentious. I like to understand what I read, rereading portions if necessary. But so much of this book had to be left behind because I couldn't make sense of it. It's a shame.
 Such a beautifully written book.  This novel emphasises the best and the worst of human nature.  It eloquently (and brutally)  illustrates that no one wins in war - not even Death in this case.<br/><br/>Although there is no getting away from the tragedy and sorrow of this story, the wonderful writing in this book was somehow uplifting.
 I got this for almost $4 and that is an amazing  price for this life changing book.  I usually go through many books but took my time with this one.  It is so worth it.
 The book brought to life the hardships the German people faced as WWII unfolded around them. They had little to eat, they were in fear for their lives, and they found that punishment could be extremely harsh for showing compassion towards a Jew. A story well told through the eyes of a young girl who found solace in reading. We grow with her as she goes through various experiences learning about life.
 Amazingly written. Heavy with metaphors and extended visual descriptions that I went back to savor and reread several times... This was a story that I had actually seen the movie first, and I'm SO glad I read it. As usual, the book offers so many additional and richer layers that the film didn't even touch on. Loved it!
 Great lyricism and economy of words exist simultaneously in the fabulously-written novel. A highly unique concept with Death as the narrator merges the dichotomy of human existence, that we live AND we die with total and unavoidable acceptance of both. Five stars! I'll see the movie but cannot imagine how it will do justice to the writer's words.
 This book truly lived up to expectations. The narrator, the thief herself, and the storytelling all come together to make a thought provoking story.  Rarely do you find a book told from this point of view, on the side of Germans living in Nazi Germany.  I loved this book, and am regretting I read it so fast.
 This is a great book.  The events of WWII Germany as seen through a young girls eyes were truly moving.  The author did a great job of putting the reader in the shoes of a young girl struggling with her identity, events of her past, and life in general.  The love Liesel had for her family is beautifully narrated.  I enjoyed how the author at times sympathized with the German people only to let us know, that they brought the events upon themselves.  This was a very emotional book, that made me laugh and at times had me close to tears.
 Ouch. Where do you begin with a compilation of ongoing exhilaration:  from sadness to pain to anger to despair to hope...?  How like today's madness!  ...and so, life love, death, and the insanity of war and useless grief continues in a crazed humanity observed by God and His angels wondering when people will figure it out.  As with Life of Pi, a superb read.  I can hardly wait to read another book by this author.  My hope is that the movie can do justice to The Book Thief.
 This book was excellent. A very good read. It started off a bit slow, with 'death' speaking, it took a little get use to the narration.<br/>Once you get into the flow of the read, it was a good story. Full of sadness and pain. But the words convened the human spirit of over coming evil with good.
 I chose the rating because I was unable to put it down. The story begins in Nazi Germany before WWII began. The duality of the human race is presented by the evil of Hitler and the goodness of her foster father. The book is narrated by Death, which gives an unusual perspective to the story.  Through the life of Liesal and her neighbors on Hummel Street, Markus Zusak shows us how good people can commit such evil just to survive. The story was both entertaining and thought provoking.
 I finished "The Book Thief" last week and I can't get myself to start on a new book, because I know the next one will pale by comparison.  In this crafty and beautiful novel by Zusak, the narrator, Death, carefully calculates for us the value of each soul that he carries off and he understands the sum of their worth better than the living.  I've read other novels about Germany during World War II, but Zusak's novel best captivates the pounding pulse of fear that comes with uncertainty, as well as the radiance of friendship and love that finds its way in a dark time.  I cried and laughed (Death has a sense of humor) and cheered and continued reading because I couldn't stop.
 I loved the book. The characters were well thought out and believable. Along with the horrors of war the author brought out the love that even strangers can share with one another. I was so enthralled with the book that I rented the video, which was also good, but missed some of the humanity of the parents. There is much to be learned about the human spirit from such writing.
 I read this book after seeing the movie, which was powerful in it's own right. This book will haunt you long after you are finished reading it.  The thing that I didn't like in the book were the narrator's comments on what would happen before the actual telling of the event.  For me, that spoiled  my anticipation for the chapters to come.
 Choosing this book to read, initially out of simple curiosity, has resulted in a visual tour of life and death in Germany 1942. The prose evokes a full range of emotions as a slice of history is dissected and examined from an intensely interesting narrative source. Recommended for any reader brave enough to share a journey of the soul with Death by your side.
 Gift
 As advertised
 The story was inspirational, heart breaking and heart warming. It was also a view of the powerless ordinary people living in the terrible time of Nazi Germany that I had not seen before.  It presented an understated picture of the courage and honorable spirit of some of the Jewish and non-Jewish people trapped in that world. I suggested it to friends because it is the type of book that must be discussed.  Great for a book club.  I way the story was told was so unique.  I loved the perspective of Death, he or she was so loving, gentle and non-judgmental.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but for now I cannot see how the mood, the love and fears of the book's characters can be as beautifully depicted on screen.  It is a book that must be experienced before watching the movie.
 The Book Thief really snuck up on me.  The unusual narration seemed uncomfortable in the beginning.  As I wipe tears away I am so glad that I kept reading.  The many layers of love and sacrifice depicted in this story are bound to reach out to you, as well.  The gentleness and strength of Papa, the stiffness of Mama and the true friendship of Rudy and Max are only some of the unexpected blessings in this young girl's life.  Entwined in a terrifying part of our history, this story will make you cherish those you love all over again.
 If this book had not be recommended by a respected friend, I would not have gone beyond the first page. However, I am glad to have read this story of ordinary lives torn apart by WWII. Zusak has created some wonderful characters to remind us of what can go wrong if we do not participate in and stand up for humanity and an honest electoral process.
 There has never been a book like this before. It is a new way to break the reader's heart on the atrocities of Nazi Germany. Death, the most expert of witnesses, here narrates both beautiful and terrible things, and the ending is no surprise. Still to read this book is to hear the story for the first time, as if all earlier versions were inadequate.
 Bought for my sons English class.  Great story and book quality.  Would buy from this seller again
 I was not crazy about reading a story where Death is the narrator, but he grabs you by the heart and won't let go. To say this book is intense, is to understate it. This narrator even tells you how the book is going to end, but you're too far to stop and you're not sure you believe him. How can death be so cruel. How can he destroy everyone you've come to love. Surely someone will survive.
 a great read, an interesting story. Told very well, from a 3rd person view. Surprising ending (well not that surprising), kept the story moving and interesting.
 I'm not sure why this book is filed away as 'Young Adult' in North America. It is a wonderful book. I must applaud Zusak - he took a subject that could be profoundly dark - that is profoundly dark, and at the end made me happy that I had read the book and experienced it all. I'm hesitant to talk too much about the plot for fear of spoilers, even though the author himself tells you throughout what is going to happen. Evidence of his mastery is the fact that even when you know what is going to happen it is a shock and a tragedy.<br/><br/>Just read it!
 I chose this book because I knew it would stir my memory.  I was born in 1939 in Cologne Germany and remember more tragic happenings after the war was over. The Author captured the true feelings of many Germans at the time.  Not everyone was a Nazi. But everyone was afraid. That fear lasted for a long time.  This is a book I will keep in my kindle forever.  Ursula
 I liked this book quite a lot. I loved the way the author mingled the senses by saying something smelled a certain color or other such references. It was an interesting point of view to have the narrator be who he was and the protagonist was attainable and likable. I laughed. I cried. I would like to know about what happened to Max and Liesel.
 A different take on World War II through the eyes of a child dealing with war, death, a new family and the challenges that not being able to read bring to her.<br/><br/>This book is significant in keeping us thinking about the Holocaust and never letting that part of history be forgotten.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book for readers of all ages.
 Despite it being considered a children's or teen's book, it's still an absolutely great read. I enjoyed every minute of reading this book. Zusak has a great way with words and is able to communicate great themes with simple yet profound incerpts. This is a novel about how powerful words can be and how they are able to change a person's life and is able to motive. He does a great job as using the idea of death as the narrator but keeping the character some what human and not too malicious or evil.<br/>I have yet to see the movie but if it's anything like the book, it's worth watching.
 I struggled with the first chapter or so of the book, I'm not sure why. After powering through, I found the book to be captivating.  Liesel and her Papa naturally call one to liking them, to be drawn into their relationship.  Mama is rough, calloused but then ... Every character is an integral part of the story and Death was kinder and gentler than I imagined he would be.
 I started out thinking the book was ok, but the more I read, the better I liked it.  It tells of a family ( and a few friends) who live<br/>in constant danger in war- torn Germany.  There is an ever-prevent danger of being arrested for the slightest suspicion<br/>of disloyalty to Hitler and any of his doctrines.  No one can be trusted to keep a secret.  Into this comes a young girl with<br/>a love for books, a refugee who is Jewish and in hiding, and the girl's introduction into the dangers and heartaches of<br/>growing up in a neighborhood that is rife with fear, death and suffering.  This story is suspenseful, touching, and informative.
 required book for school.
 The author is especially creative. I will never forget this book. Be patient. It starts a little slow but is so very worth it.
 I wasn't quite prepared for the story line, but using Death as the narrator provided an interesting perspective. I was uncomfortable reading about the Nazi atrocities and their impact on the young girl who is the subject of the story. Still, it was interesting, and I liked it enough to purchase a second copy as a gift to a friend.
 I purchased The Book Thief DVD first and watched it. Then couldn't wait to get the book to understand the entire story. Each were very good but I believe doing it as I did made it much better. Very interesting and worth the purchase of each forms.  It was very good
 This is an unforgettable story with an unusual narrator.  It was both heartbreaking and uplifting, and I couldn't help but wish it would go on … and on... and on.
 One of the best books I have read. You should definitely buy this book for your mom and grandma!
 First, I saw the movie, then I read the book. Wow, pretty much sums it up. Great read!
 This a story that I have always find incredible of how, race, tragedy, and people being punished for being just how they were born and are punished. The story, was well written and gripping. As the story went on I paused at time with aww, wow, and would cheer when she would stand up for herself. Loved it!! Thank you to the author for a great read.
 Ok
 This was a great read. Could not put it down. A heartwarming story about a little girl growing up in Nazi Germany and the highs and lows she had to endure. The relationships between the main character Liesel and the various characters are well developed and the story as a whole is captivating. This will surely become one of your favorites reads.
 Arrived very timely and in great condition as was stated.  Thank you!
 Great book
 This aurther is an artist with words.  First several chapters are hard, once you understand how the aurther uses his words it has a good flow..  take your time read it slowly
 A wonderful book, filled with humor as well as pathos. The characters are very well developed &amp; believable, &amp; Markus Zusak really brings home the day to day realities of the 2nd World war for ordinary Germans. I won't give too much away as I don't want to spoil it for anyone whose not read this, but for me this was definitely the best book of 2013.
 I thought I had reviewed this book previously; if not, let me say that the subject matter made me somewhat uncomfortable and I wouldn't ordinarily seek out stories of the Nazi German occupation of Europe, including its own country. The Allies came in for some negative commentary regarding areal bombing, but that was just a part of war, I suppose. Overall, I enjoyed the story.
 Masterfully creative and beautifully written. Unlike other reviewers, this was not a book I couldn't put down and read in a week.  Rather I read and soaked it in slowly, a few chapters at a time...similar to the slow enjoyment of a smooth and delicious, full-bodied glass of red wine.
 Saw the movie. But - as always! - the book goes far beyond. Very good story told by an unusual narrator. Some people may get the feeling it is pro Nazi. It is not! It is just pro Human. And human beings were living in wartime Germany too. They were not all monsters. Just read the book. Looking forward to other Zusak books.
 This is a story about humanity.  I pray that many read this story of a little girl in Nazi Germany during the war and never, ever forget what happened those many years ago; how the written word touched so many lives during that horrible time and also that there is survival from loss and the tragedies of war.  I definitely recommend this book!
 I can't adequately express how moved I was by this book.  If you only read one book this year, let it be this book.  I promise you will be moved by the story...you will be amazed at what a novel can actually do to your emotions...you will buy copies for friends and family and you will certainly love it.  It is one of the best, most moving books I have read!
 The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is suppose to be one of those rare book that comes along every so often and change your outlook on life. It's sad, depressing and makes you really think on what is most important in life. Did it succeed in doing that for me personally? Honestly, I wouldn't really say so as I've definitely read other more life changing stories that The Book Thief but that isn't to say that I didn't enjoy the book. It is definitely something special and I'm extremely glad that a movie was made of it as it broadens the audience members. Instead of always watching mindless action flicks, I hope more movie-goers give this movie a chance in hopes of experiencing something a little different than what they are normally used to.<br/><br/>If you've never liked stories that uses a war torn WWII Germany as the backdrop, then well, that's exactly what you'll be getting here! Personally, I can never tire of it. It usually makes for a somewhat depressing yet captivating story. The Book Thief is told through the eyes of a very special "narrator" and I'm sure that if you've read some of the other reviews for the book, someone somewhere must have given it away. Luckily for me, I just picked up the book and started reading without every going through one user review at all. It does make for a very interesting narrative as you'll follow along in the childhood of Liesel Meminger of Himmel Street. Being very poor, there's not much that Liesel can do that requires money. Eventually though, Liesel finds that she would come alive through the power of words in a book. As the title already gave it away, stealing books would become one of Liesel's favorite hobbies.<br/><br/>What I liked most about The Book Thief is the poetic nature of the author's writing. He never lost me for one moment throughout the book, which is quite lengthy if I think about it now. The author just finds a way to write ever so smoothly from page to page and once you discover who the narrator is, the poetic style of writing feels even more haunting and chilling to say the least. It might put some readers off in the beginning but if you stick with it, you'll feel right at home after a few chapters in. What I'm most disappointed with in The Book Thief is that well, I actually thought it would involve more book stealing! I thought it would involve Liesel finding more clever ways to get her next book in the collection but it's not really about that. The characters in the story are a bit dry as they just seem to remain the same throughout the book save for a few instances. On a positive note however, I still can say that there were many memorable pieces sprinkled throughout the book to makeup for the negatives.<br/><br/>The Book Thief in my opinion definitely deserves its praises but everything is with fault and so is this book. When you have such a highly rated and popular book, there are bound to be many readers who gets sucked into the hype only to realize that its not worth it. That is fine because you can't create something that everyone will like. The Book Thief gives me yet another look into one of the darkest periods of mankind and for that it was worth reading in my eyes.
 WOW - this is a book you will only want to start when you have plenty of time because you won't want to put it down.  Written from an interesting perspective.  Had I know it was about pre Nazi Germany, I probably would not have read it so I am glad I did not know and went on the recommendation of a friend.  This is a book not to be missed.
 This book is about words, yet I can't seem to find any ones<br/>adequate to explain my experience that has sunk so deeply within.  I, too, do not understand the human souls and conditions.  Wonderful use of similes and metaphors.  Personification was always unexpected clarity and jarring reality.  The writing style was shocking, yet mesmerizing.
 The book started off somewhat confusing, as it was bouncing around and somewhat convoluted. But by page 10, I had figured out it was from the perspective of Death, and I was hooked. It is a gripping novel that came highly recommended by my daughter's English teacher. I figured it would be more suitable for a high school student, but it is ageless.
 I rarely give five stars. The author Markus Zusak untangles the knots of people of Nazi Germany. So much of the book seems so simple, yet woven so tightly that it's many parallel narratives will continue to stay in my heart and mind. I highly recommend this WWII book. I have read nothing like it and am so grateful for it. If you read it you will be too.
 Once again, a difficult book to rate. But more on that later.<br/><br/>First, this will sound like blasphemy, but I think this would be a better movie than a book. And I know that there is a movie coming out for it, now whether it will be as good as it could be, I will wait and see.<br/><br/>One reason I think this would be a better movie than a book is pacing. I very rarely speed read, I quite enjoy reading every word in a novel and being absorbed by it. I had to skim/speed read from around the 40% mark to the 60% mark. And I am not entirely sure it is because of the pacing and not just a grey slow plot section. A movie is time restrained, so it would benefit from that.<br/><br/>Another benefit of the movie would be erasing the writing style. I liked the writing style (Death is the narrator after all), but as much as I liked it, I don't believe it helped the story at all, it may very well have hurt it. It often felt like things were described in such a roundabout fashion that I was left just wishing for it to get to the point.<br/><br/>Now where the book will certainly be better (especially considering the trailer I just watched) is the characters, their interactions, and their feelings for each other. Very quickly I could see and enjoy Liesel's love for her Papa, this was quick and to the point. But the subtle way of showing Mama's love for Liesel was a work of art. The same with all the characters, so that by the ending, all events had full emotional impact.<br/><br/>My friend said that she thinks it would be better for younger readers (I'm 24) and maybe that's it, I am not the target audience. I also certainly believe this should be taught in school rather than many other, outdated novels (or plays by a certain bard).<br/><br/>But back to my original comment. If a book forces me to speed read, it gets a 1 or a 2. But if I believe others should read it, it makes me think, and I get some kind of feeling from it, it gets a 5. So I'll give this book a 3.5 rounded up to a 4 star (or maybe it is a 4 star and I will revise this review later).<br/><br/>I recommend this to everyone just because I do not regret reading it, and it probably is one of those books that should be read. Eventually.
 This story was well written.  The first part was a little hard to sort out and I was not sure if it was about the "gatherer of souls" or the family.  The daughter who was given to foster parents was amazing.  Life in Germany during World War  II was hard especially if you were not a member of the party.  Good read and I highly recommend.
 Unusually written.  I loved the characters and their relationships with each other.<br/>This book gives us an idea of what it was like to live on the other side of WW 11, the German side.<br/>This is a German family struggling with the idea of Hitler and war.<br/>Liesel, the central character, is wild and full of life.  Her love of books provides the fuel to keep her<br/>alive when times are tough.<br/>An excellent read.
 I'm not a big fan of wartime stories. Too often, the whole conflict is set up for the writer. Then the writer throws in some deaths, and some young characters with tremendous fortitude, and it gets reviewed by critics as a beautiful story about the human condition.<br/><br/>But that's all a generalization. Let's talk about this book in particularly. I'll start with my criticism: I didn't like the ending. I can't say too much more without spoiling it, but I will say that the ending is absolutely in line with what you would expect from a wartime story. It seemed like the author was thinking to himself, “Let’s make this grand ending that spawns a million book group discussions about the horrors of war.” No, let’s not. Let’s write a book that takes place during wartime and not a single person dies. Now THAT would be original.<br/><br/>Now that I’ve gotten the criticism out of the way, here’s what I did like about the book:<br/>(1) It’s a book that takes place during World War II, and the main characters are German, and yet they’re portrayed as the good guys. They even say Heil Hitler!! It takes some balls to write a book like that, and it takes some talent to pull that off.<br/>(2) The narrator is the Grim Reaper, and Zusak pulls this off so successfully. Rather than portraying the Reaper as evil, he portrays him as just a person doing their job. The Reaper accepts that death is a natural part of existence, but still recognizes that some people have been given the opportunity to live richer, fuller lives than others. And the Reaper comes to admire those people that fervently fight off death. All in all, the narration was tastefully done.<br/>(3) The writing was immensely readable. Zusak’s a story teller. He’s not an intellectual trying to impress you with his philosophies, or a poet trying to use nouns as verbs to impress you. Just a storyteller, which I happen to like.<br/>(4) Liesel is so, so likeable. So is Rudy Steiner. So are her foster parents and just about all the characters. And the reason they’re likeable is not because they’re written as these wonderful, selfless people who never do anything wrong. It’s because they do things that are wrong. They make selfish or dumb decisions, but they genuinely care about one another and they’re overall good people.<br/><br/>And since I have come up with four things I love about the book and only one piece of criticism, it gets four stars from me.
 I can not get over this book. It's been almost 3 weeks since I've finished it and I'm waiting on a brand new copy of my own to arrive in the mail so I can read it again. This book made me feel every possible emotion! Even though you are hearing the story from death, it is a beautifully told story.
 This is a true gem of a novel.  I love it when I read such books.  Like a Xmas present !  The story was so real I was there with these wonderful people........<br/>A true treasure.  If you want to feel the world and the universe in all it's glory, horror, beauty, love and hate and magnificence, sit back with this beautiful book......
 This book brings a portion of WWII to reality. It makes one wonder how many people in Germany hid Jewish people &amp; defied the Nazis. Liesel &amp; Rudy formed the lasting friendship that is seldom realized. She was a true survivor and courageous beyond most people.
 This was a good book. It takes a little while to get into, but if you stick with it you will be rewarded. It is so much more than just the tale of a book thief. I refuse to spoil the book for you, I highly reccommend you see what all the fuss is about. However, if you are expecting a light fun read this is not the tale for you.
 I'm so happy I read this book. Although very sad and sickening in many ways, this book is written so well you can almost forgive that. I've read many books pertaining to WWII and Hitler and enjoyed almost all of them. This, by far, is my favorite. You fall in love with so many characters. And your heart aches for each one. A must read!
 I am not even sure where to start with this review. There are so many reviews for this book whatever I say won't add much so I will just say that this book was a magnificent story! I cried at several points in the book especially at the end! I can't recommend this book enough even if you don't really like to read! I don't understand how anyone could not be moved by this book no matter how old you!
 I didn't know what to expect since I didn't allow myself to listen to any of the hype surrounding the movie.  A dear friend recommended this book to me several years ago.  It's been on my "to read" list for a while.  I can honestly say that I was not disappointed.  If you have an appreciation for the beauty of language and words and the many different ways they can be woven together, then you'll love this book.
 When starting to read this book ,I thought it would be a tedious read.  Instead it became riveting as I continued.<br/>The style of writing is unique . Once you see what is happening its hard to put down.  Daily chores done while reading seem much less onerous.  Other chores just don't get done.
 This book arrived on time, in good condition, and was a great price. I ordered it for my book club back in 2011 not knowing what to expect. What a phenomenal story! This book is beautifully written and really makes its reader reflect. It's aimed at a young adult audience but I recommend it to everyone. My whole family has since read it on my recommendation and it remains a collective favorite.
 Here is a great book on good people caught up in bad times.<br/><br/>The author's unusual playful style is in marked contrast with the supposed character of the narrator (Death) or the realities of the 1940's Germany. The way he brings out the hidden good nature of people like the Mayor and his wife or Rosa or some of the street boys is exemplary. His efforts to show that even during the holocaust, Germany did not have just a handful of people quietly rebelling against the perverted misdeeds but many is not something taken up so wonderfully probably ever in popular writing.<br/><br/>The moving scenes of the book may read soppy or preachy to some but they work and appear real within the context. The worship of Jesse Owens, the protection of a fleeing Jew, the adoption, the love for words, the feeding of the hungry, the assistance to the neighbours - the book appears like a collection of what a good samaritan should be doing according to any religious or ethical textbook for a growing child but told in an astonishingly beautiful way. The good guys soldier on bravely and the bad somehow do not need as much description.<br/><br/>Not just for the young adults but for all.
 As I finish this amazing story with tears on my cheeks, I am at a loss for words. I can't find the vocabulary for how much this book touched me. It is one of the best books I have ever read and I wish I could write a review to do it justice, but I am still in a foggy haze. I loved this story and it goes on my list of favorite books right next to my all time favorite The Diary of Anne Frank. Hopefully I can come back later and write a more eloquent review, but for now this will have to do. Thank you Markus Zusak for writing The Book Thief. It will stay with me for a long, long time.
 This book is directed to young readers but I found it fascinating.  One of the quickest reads I have had in a while and I really didn't want the story to end.  Good summer reading.  I would recommend that you read the book over watching the movie as a lot of the story is missed in the movie plot.
 A great book. One of the best books I have read in a long time. I read a lot and this one is thoughtful and well developed. The plot is serious but written in a hopeful manner. I dont want to give away any more info. Read this book. A really wonderfully written novel.
 From beginning to end, the writer knows how to pull you in. His prose is interesting and captivating...in fact, for a book about death (and narrated by death itself), the book stays alive through all five-hundred and fifty pages. Zusak compiles a sweetly sentimental story of fact and fiction that gives readers a simple and powerful new perspective on WWII.
 Wonderful story - I couldn’t put it down. Love in all its forms will always outlive hate.
 I didn't want to put the book down.  It captures your attention the more you read.  You might think it starts out slow but the more you read the more you understand.  I didn't want it to end.  Well written!
 A very interesting story showing the side of being raised in Hitler's Germany as told by a young girl who accepted and thought his teachings were logical at first; until he started the annihilation of the Jews.  Then a lot of German people began to doubt and dislike his rantings.  A new angle I have never read before to see "their side" of living in Nazi Germany.
 Great Book!
 I made a deal with myself to  try and read a few of the books on my TBR pile each month on top of my other book commitments. The Book Thief has been on the top of that pile for quite a while. I know, I know! Try not to judge...I'm quite embarrassed that it has taken this long for me to tackle it. I honestly don't have any excuses. I love historical fiction and more importantly books surrounding World War I and World War II. My Mother, Sister and Daughter have all read it as well as numerous of my friends. It was time for me to read it.<br/><br/>I knew I was in trouble after just a few pages. Not only did the story take place in WWII Germany but it was narrated by death. It did not have the makings of a happily ever after. First off, I wasn't sure how an entire book (particularly one that is 576 pages long) could be narrated by death without being completely depressing. I have to say though, that it worked beautifully. Of course there was a lot of depressing content, it was WWII after all, but at the same time there was a lot of beauty within the pages. Not only was the narration of the story unique but so was the writing and together it made for one of the best books that I have read in quite some time. The descriptors in this book were so vivid that I felt like I could reach out and touch them. It was pure 100% talent at its finest.<br/><br/>I won't go into detail about the plot because this book has been reviewed millions of times. I will say, however, that the synopsis did not do it justice. It was far bigger and greater than how it was described. Some of the best characters were also found within the pages of this book that I adored. Leisel Meminger was an amazing young girl with a love for books. How could I not love her and the people she loved like Max, Rudy and Papa to name just a few.<br/><br/>I won't lie and say that it was all rainbows and unicorns althought there was a lot of colour. There were times when I had a lump in my throat and a few times the tears ran down my face. I really can't properly put into words how moving and enjoyable this book was for me. After reading hundreds (yes hundreds) of books surrounding WWII you would think that they would all start to read the same. This was absolutely not the case. This was a uniquely beautiful story that would be suitable for readers of all ages. There really isn't anything that I can say other than it is a must read. I wish I hadn't waited so long to read it myself.<br/><br/>I loved every heartbreaking page of this book and won't soon forget it.
 I really enjoyed this book.  Based on the book reviews, I bought copies for my brother's 13 year old daughter, my boyfriend's 13 year old daughter and me.  I am so glad that I did.  I loved the unique narrative perspective and the complexity of the characters.  I am so excited to hear the girls' perspective of the book and the main character.
 This book was " different" from the normal first person story telling. This book was full of human emotions, a deep story line and personal emotions as well as tragedies... a story with a basis of strong human attachments and deep love. I would enjoy seeing the movie now that I have read the book, hoping that the movie would follow the story line.
 When you have read so much non-fiction from famous names about famous men, it's hard to remember that the regular citizens suffered so much as well.  Not masterminds or master race: beyond the comprehension of vast plans...but beneath them fiction takes life and Death about their business, day to day. Just a little girl and her book..nothing to fear.
 The fact that the story is narrated by death makes this outstanding story that much richer and intriguing. The characters were so well developed you could see them; you felt like you knew them by the time the story ended. The word choices and dialogue were natural, real, 'everyday' - which made the story so touchable. I will be thinking about this book, it's events and characters for awhile... Big thanks to the author.
 Written from such an interesting and peculiar point of view. A great, enduring novel that brings you closer than you ever could be to understanding the core of human emotion.
 This was such an amazing novel. There is so much to say about this that I don't know where to begin. I'm just going to give my thoughts on the book.<br/><br/>What I loved about this book:<br/><br/>- Death narrating the story. I liked that he had a major voice in this book.<br/>- Liesel and her love for books.<br/>- The relationship between Liesel and her father, Hans. They had a sweet relationship and I loved that he teaches her how to read.<br/>- The friendship between Rudy and Liesel.<br/>- The setting of the book. I love historical fiction novels. The writer really describes everything in great detail.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this book?<br/>Definitely!
 This is a compelling story, and extremely well-written. The imagery is magnificent. My only reason for not granting it 5 stars is that there was so much unnecessary profanity. In my opinion, the book would be better without it.
 Great book.  Not one that makes you feel happy while reading it.  Instead, you feel that you are part of the era where this little girl, her family, and her neighbors have absolutely nothing.  This little girl had 3 people in her life who encouraged her in their own ways, to learn to read, develop her athletic abilities and to love.  It's hard to believe how these people lived.
 Great book
 Excellent and different kind of story of a young girl's life during the reign of Hitler. A story of abandonment, foster parents, hiding a person, friends and survival. The surprise is realizing who is the narrator. Love comes in many forms and we need the love in order to survive even the greatest tragedies of life. A very good read.
 The Book Thief is a beautifully written, often poetic, and profoundly moving work of fiction about ordinary Germans living in Nazi Germany during WW 2.  The author vividly portrays the contradictions inherent in human nature, our capacity for love and for hatred, as the narrator, Death himself, relates the story of the young German girl, Liesel, who is the Book Thief of the story.  The persecution of the Jews is a central theme of the novel as well.  The conclusion of the story literally brought tears to my eyes.  Highly recommended to all readers interested in history and human nature.<br/>  Barry D. Kass
 Reading "The Book Thief" was an amazing experience; not just for the historical perspective, but mostly for the elegant and poignant language that was used.  I found myself re-reading sentences just to enjoy a description or turn of a phrase.  And the choice of the narrator was intense!  Immediately upon completing "The Book Thief" I bought another book by M Zusak.
 Sorry, didn't mean to yell at you. However, this is one of those once in a decade books. Amazing. A story that will stick with you for a long time. I haven't seen the movie yet, I hope it doesn't disappoint, but I rented it today and know how I will be spending my evening. Seriously, read this book.
 Important story well told.  Easy to read, and no filler.  I enjoyed coming to this book throughout the time it took to read it, although the subject is a hard one. Set in Nazi Germany, Death narrates the story of a child who survives a trauma early on in her life.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well written novel.
 I only regret that I waited too long to read, "The Book Thief". When yo u think you've heard it all and t h e worst man can do; "The Book THIEF" will show you that you haven't seen or heard it all. My eyes were opened and I have a new w appreciation for what this generation endured.
 I am enjoying reading the book.  Saw the movie before reading the book which helps me picture the characters.  I love Leisl and her love of books.  At first I was a little turned off with the idea/thought that this was written from the perspective of the "Grim Reaper", but it works.  War is awful and there are many innocent victims.
 This book was 1 of the best historical fiction book I ever read! The writing was nothing less then brilliant. Some of the parts were so sad. I  felt so helpless at times for the characters faith.I loved the illustrated book Max wrote. That in it self is a novel!This is a important part of world history.I learn about the German people .Many were victims as well.The Jewish people went thorough so much suffering! We learn courage thorough it's main characters.
 Raw depictions of life in Germany during World War II. Characters and story structure unlike those in any book I have read before. One of the best books I have ever read.
 I love this book!  Plenty of others gave a synopsis.  I want to rave about the way the story invites you in and keeps you wanting to know what will happen next.  Zusak did an amazing job of making Death both somber yet funny at times.  The characters are well developed, the plot is engaging, and the overarching themes keep you thinking.  This is a true treasure!
 I do not recall ever reading a Book that took hold of me like this one.  I recommend it as a brilliant unique piece of literature. The images, personalities and senses extraordinaire gave me a whole new outlook on perceptions of everything.  I will read it again and again.<br/>I originally ordered it on my Kindle, but I wanted a hard copy for my library.  I think this review and my subsequent order for another copy says it all.<br/>You must read it.<br/>Shirley
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The relationships that Liesel develops with different characters in the book are special and unique. Although I expected to be touched by the relationship between Liesel and Max, it's her relationships with Rudy, her stepfather and stepmother, the mayor's wife, and a neighbor that help you to learn what a special child she is. You really feel her emotions and the hardships she endures. I loved the story within a story, also. I really didn't want the book to end.
 You're not likely to forget this story!  A young girl, Leisel, is placed into foster care by her mother to give the child a chance to escape the poverty and cruelty that awaited her otherwise.  The death of her little brother causes Liesel to turn to books for comfort. When the war begins, books are being burned and are forbidden but Liesel begins to take extraordinary risks to steal books in her efforts to deal with the cruelty of the world around her.  Difficult to put down!
 The narrative was so interesting and gave a very enjoyable twist to the story.  I found it difficult to put this book down.  I had seen the movie and was not going to bother to read the book but am so very glad I did!  The casting of the movie was perfect.  This is a very haunting and realistic story about the German people during the war.
 While I wasn't all that keen with the narrator in the book, I thought the story was excellent. Tough time in German history, for a lot of people, not just Jews, and the take away for me was the need for courage during trying political times. I liked the characters, plot, and descriptions. I highly recommend this book.
 Touches every nerve, WWII story of a survivor as told through the eyes of the angel of death. Humans haunt him and this tale of the book thief will give me many moments of reflection.
 Such an interesting way to write Zusak has!!!  I was scared and heartbroken all the way thru the book--the goodness and the hatefulness of the foster mother--the gentleness of the foster father--the Book Thief herself and her side kick--and the cellar dweller--all the characters were painfully real and in agony. I finished reading in weeks ago and it's harsh reality still haunts me and my dreams.
 Even though the style of writing was quite different, this is one of the best books I've ever read. The scenes &amp; characters will stay with me for a long time. I can't stop thinking about each one and the tragedies of WWII. As I was reading I felt their pain &amp; wanted a good outcome for them all, but war doesn't do that. I totally recommend this book.
 Outstanding and Haunting Story of a young girl in Nazi Germany.  I won't discuss the content, only how the book is told from the point of view of Death. I enjoyed watching the author's video here on amazon.  I read the book a few years ago and I kept the book. Most fiction books I donate to my library or turn them to a consignment store. As a WWII biographer, I have a comprehensive library of books that I won't give up - this book is one of them. In my travels in Germany, I've listened to many stories of German veterans and their families and friends. If you can even get people to talk that is. I don't insist, but the horror of war still lurks. The horror of destruction of all that one has built - safety in homes - safety in trusting one's police - trusting in one's government - this didn't exist in Nazi Germany. It was Fear, prevalent fear. An incredible book in a story that I'll never forget.
 A must read - can't wait to see the movie. This book is pleasurable and sad at the same time. Gives insight into Nazi Germany and the lives of the poor and innocent and how the Jews were persecuted. Leisel takes us to the joys of reading. Odd being narrated by death but apt seeing that there was so much death then.
 I bought this book because of the movie. It was so good, I had to have the book. The theme is very interesting since is about history. I don't want to spoil it for you. The shipping process was great. I didn't have any problems. The book arrived just in time. I'm looking forward to read it and share it since the plot is so intriguing. I really recommend this book and the seller. It was a great experience!
 I thought this book was a fascinating look at Nazi Germany during WW11 from a new persective: a native German family.  It was very powerful and beautifully written.
 This was a lovely book with wonderful details and descriptions that made you able to quickly envision the life and times that these people had to exist in during World War II.
 When I started reading this, I found it really hard going. I almost decided to just cut my losses and not bother reading more. It's av good thing I persisted or else I would have regretted not finishing it. The author has a different style of writing that I found really effective in treating the story. I highly recommend people read this book.
 A,of letters paint in all shapes and sizes . Lemon hair, dark feathery hair but only if was clean, if it was dirty it was twigs. And the colors . I smiled at the women swearing it took me to my childhood and my little round German grandma during the same time frame. I loved The Book Thief. I hated it too..I well read it again in about a year.
 The characters i the story are so great. Death, the narrator, is a very upfront storyteller. You know at the beginning of the story what happens at the end. It was the characters in the story that kept you reading. I thought it was remarkable that even though I was constantly reminded of how the story would end that when it actually did I was still moved to tears. Great storytelling.
 An amazing book.  The moment I suspected, and then confirmed, the narrator's identity was golden. The characters rich.  A very thought provoking read.  Thank you Mr. Zusak.
 I read this book after seeing the preview for the movie. Books that take place during WWII have always fascinated me and I was looking forward to reading The Book Thief by Markus Zusak.<br/><br/>The characters are amazing. I loved Liesel and Max's friendship and seeing the softening of the mother's heart as time goes on. There's no doubt that the setting and characters are flawlessly developed.<br/><br/>I thought the idea of death as the narrator of the story was an interesting concept but poorly executed. The narration breaks the flow of the story. Every time "Death's" voice was heard, it was short little descriptions or definitions of specific words. When I was reading these parts, it came off as though it was a portion of the author's outline that he didn't know how else to write into the book.<br/><br/>Another problem I had with The Book Thief was that there was no conflict. There was some tension but every problem was so easily resolved, I couldn't get a real grasp on the story.<br/><br/>Overall, I rate The Book Thief by Markus Zusak 3 stars. With so many other books that take place during this time period, I don't think I'll be recommending this one.<br/><br/>For more honest reviews please visit: whattiffanyreads.blogspot.com
 I understand that this book was written with the Young Adult reader in mind but this is a masterpiece of prose that anyone who appreciates fine writing will enjoy.  Vivid imagery that is beautiful and haunting with rich characters whom you care deeply about.  Thank you my daughter for sharing this wonderful story with your Papa.
 I chose this rating because the book was a gripping statement of the inequities of war. It was a different perspective of World War II<br/>showing the adverse effects on a portion of a population that did not fully comprehend the reasoning that led to it, the ultimate goal and how it would determine their future. It was a touching story of innocence and reality, deprivation and fulfillment, sadness and joy. It portrayed a segment of a people that questioned, mostly silently a charismatic, ruthless leader.  It was sad and unsettling and left this reader with an ache that brought a soul to tears. And the children who suffer, yet endure and go on to hopefully live another day.
 Having seen the film, I HAD to read the book. Having the book tie into the film was a brilliant touch, since several scenes are replayed as you read. In the film it takes some time to figure out the narrator, while it is immediately apparent in the book. What sets this apart is we get a glimpse of the common German people, not the leaders, living in a small village. We do not usually consider the little people in this war. The book and the movie are expertly executed.
 This was an assigned reading for a college English class. To be honest, I was not too interested to begin with. As soon as I started, I had a hard time putting it down!  This is a great book about a horrible time; the setting and characters are so real.  It touched my heart, made me laugh and made me cry.
 I thought this was going to be a difficult read, after all, the story occurs in Nazi Germany.  While the story had difficult moments, I was easily intrigued by the main character, an insightful little girl name Liesel.  The bottom line is that loving kind people can endure the most difficult of times and experiences.
 No pornography, deep and emotional plots, outstanding portrayal of death and dying, without heavy religious overtones. The book has excellent humor, divine insight to human nature, This would be a very appropriate book for 8-10 grade reading. This book is better than most school-mandated books. I would recommend this book to EVERYONE.
 Having lived in the era of WWII, I realize how blessed I am that I lived in the USA during that time.  The author is correct in his premise that it was all done with WORDS.  I see that happening here now and it disturbs me greatly.  I fear for the future of this country.  The pen is still mightier than the sword and we need to be aware of their use.
 One of the books that actually made the Germans real people and not just pod people that were  blindly following a crazed dictator.  Never questioning , or even thinking for themselves .  This is one of those books that showed them to be the same as others in the world at this time . They were caught up in a dictator's  and their nightmare..
 This book has so much detail and emotion. It took the perspective of an unlikely character and told the story about one girl who changed the lives of many. This story is truly remarkable. I very much enjoyed this book. I would recoment it to everyone. It was a little confusing when you first start to read it, but by the 3rd chapter you're hooked. I did, however, watch the movie before reading the book. They were both very good but so very different. I do recommend that if you want to see the movie, watch it BEFORE you read the book. It helps you understand some of the early chapters of the book. I definitely will rate this as the best book I've ever read. I hope others enjoy it as much as I do.
 Markus Zusak created an amazing image of what it must have been like in rural Germany during WW2. His descriptions and imagery are vivid and haunting. The Book Thief is captivating in its descriptions of a family struggling to maintain a sense of normalcy in an impossible environment. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
 Loved it! A great book to ponder. I originally bought it for my 10 year old daughter but after reading it comma I don't think it's appropriate for her until she several years older.
 I have learned several critical lessons during 70 years of playing chess.  The most important have been (1) "If I do this, what are the possible consequences and how will I respond to each?" and (2) "How does the other side view the board and how does he see the game?"<br/> I can remember WW2 personally, and I've read many books covering the European military theater.  But I've never seen the "board" from the perspective of powerless German civilians.  This story was a real epiphany written in a truly unique style.  Don't miss it!
 Do you want your heart ripped out and stomped on, torn into bits, and flushed down the toilet? Then this is your book.<br/>It is probably the best book I have had the pleasure, and heart break, to read in recent years. We cry every single time we read this or watch the movie but we keep coming back for more. Bravo!
 I ordered this book after attending our first Seder meal. This was suggested by the Rabbi who was our keynote speaker for this event. It sounded intriguing. I have read a few pages, and can tell that I will enjoy it. It is extremely important to remember what the Jewish people endured through the Hitler "era".
 I enjoyed this book very much.  I'm not usually the type to say, "I couldn't put it down." but this book was one of those.  It kept my interest, made me wonder what would happen next.  Even though it was written during the time of the Holocaust, it wasn't all about it.  It's one of those books you think about awhile after you've finished it.
 captivating ... found the narrator idea incredible.  It  should be read by everyone and wannabe authors.  excellent read.  loved it.
 This was a tough book to read.  It was not light hearted.  It was thoughtful.  It made me find out what developed at the end.  Can't say I really enjoyed it but I found it well worth reading.
 I chose this book because it's a movie.  little did I know how truly beautiful a story this is.  I very rarely am affected by what I read but this book is an exception.  I was brought to tears a few times at the sincerity and simplicity of the people during this horrendous period in our human history.  A must read......
 Eye opening world of average German under Nazi control.  Identify with, become the characters.  Full gamut of horror, beauty, suffering, death.  Prepare to cry.
 The Book Thief Was beautifully written --- very hard to put down. I loved it because it gave an understanding of the lives of ordinary people in wartime, and because of the sensitive portrayal of the characters.<br/>  Cath kehoe.<br/>In the simplest of language,the author of The Book Thief depicted so many of the horrors suffered not only by Jews but by the ordinary German  families during the horrific bombing raids. Perhaps even more distressing was witnessing the suffering and humiliation of those unfortunates being marched to the extermination camps.This is etched into their minds.<br/>  Brian Kehoe.
 The strength of the human heart and our capacity for love and kindness shine through the tragedy of war.  This should be required reading for all ages.  Despite all the hate and cruelty in this world, humanity manages to salvage itself through simple acts of kindness. I would give this book 10 stars, if that were possible. Thank you, Mr. Zusak, for restoring my faith.
 A great book. So much about is different, the narrator, the style and the approach. It had to be so because the historical background is almost too familiar. For once we see the other side of the German people. They too suffered, were deprived and tortured. They were also human with all the instincts for self-preservation which that entails. The devastation of war on families and individuals it describes makes it compulsory reading. War is not all about great feats of bravery.
 A very well written book, so much more than the movie ever could be.  It is partly narrated by a very unconventional source which makes it even more intriguing.
 Oh my, as a Book-junkie, this  beautifully sad, yet at times  quite funny story told by the Grim Reaper himself, will present you with a new perspective on Germans in Hitler's maniacal era. You will love Liesel, and hate the deep heartbreaks this young girl has. You will equally love Rudy, Hans, Rosa, and Max.<br/>Zusak's characters are so real, that often you feel what they feel.<br/>I would give this book more stars than 5.  Superb writing
 Without giving away too much.... this book has the most interesting narrator I have ever come across. With such a strong voice, the narrator takes you through the life of a German girl who is adopted by a poor family during WWII. As the story progresses, she learns to read and comes to understand the power of words. Her friendships are few but strong and they touch your heart. In the mess that surrounds her life, the chapters are made up of small stories and adventures. READ IT.
 An odd yet perfect choice of narrator, characters so clear they swim around in your head long after you put down the book, words that are chosen and cobbled together exquisitely and a story that is as heartbreaking as it is beautiful. Don't bother reading the reviews, just read the book.
 From the moment I opened this book I couldn't put it down. I became so involved with each character and formed an immediate bond with Liesel. I laughed, cried my heart out and was sick with grief at the way some of the people were treated. To see such hatred... I am an avid reader and to say this book is among my top five is saying something. I highly recommend this book to everyone; the readers and non readers alike. You will not be let down by the author. Your heart will ache, but you will not be let down. By the way... this is the first review I have ever given anything. It's that good.
 I was disappointed in this book.  I had read so many good reviews on it.  The parts where death was talking was very depressing.  I did finish it though.
 Good
 I really enjoy reading historically based novels. I think my first love was Anne Frank's Diary, and this book ranks right up there. It gave me such a real picture of Germany during the war..... the Jews, their pain, the Germans, their suffering. I lived inside this book as I read it. Well done!
 This is not type of book I normally read, yet I was drawn by the title. As I realized the narrator was the Reaper, I thought what an interesting perspective...<br/><br/>This was a wonderful read as it drew me closer and tied me to the characters.  I want to see the movie, but I fear it will, like many others, fall well short of this wonderfully crafted story.<br/><br/>The pain of war is exceeded by the woe of aftermath.
 The sadness of war... the suffering of innocent victims... young people witnessing brutality that traumatise their souls... these themes are the subject of many well written books. This book balances the pathos of cruel circumstances with the hardened<br/>cynicism of the angle of death who goes out each night to collect the souls of the newly dead. The balance gives freshness and believability to the circumstances of the two young characters of "The Book Thief". I enjoyed every page.
 This was an amazing read! Very unique point of view - given it is first person from the view of the grim-reaper himself. It was a real tear-jerker.
 Such a wonderful, inspiring story of survival and a loving family. Stories about Hitler taking over fascinate me and this shows it from<br/>a family's point of view. I don't plan to see the movie because I believe the thinking and sweetness of these characters cannot possibly be depicted as well as this book.
 Great book. Enjoyed the colors, the clouds, the joy and tears. Rarely do I read a book that I dread the last page. But this book was one I did not want to end. I fell in love with the characters and laughed with them as I knew I would cry for them. Thank you for writing such a wonderful book.
 So many great books this year for opening that door that gives you a love of reading--this book has to be one of those books.  I cannot stress enough how important it is to give children gateways to loving books. This book is excellent for young teens--mature adults.  It should appeal to all readers and gives another chance to start a career in reading which is so important.
 I was very excited to read this book after all the reviews I read. I had trouble getting into the first maybe quarter of the book. I think maybe I was just in the wrong environment for reading. As the chapters go by though, it gets better. The last half of the book is just incredible. I've been reading thrillers as of lately and I love the page-turning books. This is one of them, but in somewhat of a different way. Just read it!
 Could not put it down, kept me going.  Great story about a young girl in war torn Germany .  Makes you realize what people went through during World War II.  How compassionate people can be during severe times.  Also the resolve of a thirteen year old girl and how much she can endure.  Can't wait to read another of Markus Zusak's books.
 I did not see the movie but the book is wonderful and grabs the reader at the outset. The style is unique in that there is a brief sort of outline at the beginning of each chapter and then the narrative. The voice for the novel is our old friend Death. I loved this book and recommend it for all book lovers.
 Love this movie.
 “First the colours.<br/><br/>Then the humans.<br/><br/>That’s usually how I see things.<br/><br/>Or at least, how I try.”<br/><br/>The Book Thief is narrated by Death, himself. Death—although portrayed as almost sympathetic—watches from afar the life of Liesel Meminger who is the thief herself. An adopted daughter to Hans and Rosa Hubermann, she finds her consolation in words.<br/><br/>Stolen words that start to give her a sense of camaraderie with her foster father.<br/><br/>Stolen words that comfort her neighbors in basements during bombing raids.<br/><br/>Stolen words that comfort a Jewish man in her basement.<br/><br/>Death has a personality. He warns you ahead of time when something bad is about to happen. He feels the same trepidation, the same sense of foreboding you will when you know something’s wrong. He’s trying to understand the human race as desperately as humans are.<br/><br/>Muskus Zusak accomplished a great feat – making me ache for the people and children of Nazi Germany, reminding me that people , whether good or bad, deserved to be loved because they are, after all, only human.<br/><br/>This book is an ode to the people who managed to keep their humanity in the midst of war, a tribute to the people who did not succumb to the evil around them and an acknowledgement of all those brave souls who were punished for doing what was right.<br/><br/>“So much good, so much evil. Just add water.”<br/><br/>Rudy Steiner, the boy with hair the color of lemons, capable of so much love, so much life whose death devastated me. A death that was so casually and off-handedly mentioned by Death. A wasted life with so much potential, so much capability for doing good.<br/><br/>“How about a kiss, Saumensch?”<br/><br/>He stood waist-deep in the water for a few moments longer before climbing out and handing her the book. His pants clung to him, and he did not stop walking. In truth, I think he was afraid. Rudy Steiner was scared of the book thief’s kiss. He must have longed for it so much. He must have loved her so incredibly hard. So hard that he would never ask for her lips again and would go to his grave without them.”<br/><br/>Max Vandenburg, a Jewish nobody but someone you’re going to cry for. He fist fights with the Fuhrer and somehow, he’s going to fight his way into your heart.<br/><br/>“THE LAST WORDS OF MAX VANDENBURG: You’ve done enough.”<br/><br/>Rosa Hubermann. She’s described as being the woman with a filthy mouth and a wardrobe figure. And yet you know. You just know that this woman has a heart of gold.<br/><br/> “Make no mistake, the woman had a heart. She had a bigger one that people would think. There was a lot in it, stored up, high in miles of hidden shelving. Remember that she was the woman with the instrument strapped to her body in the long, moon-slit night.”<br/><br/>But if there were a true “hero” of the story, so to speak, it would be Hans Hubermann. Death, in the earlier parts of the novel, describes Hans Hubermann as the type to slip by you unnoticed. The kind of gentle humility this man is capable of is astounding. And Hans’s ability to be “not noticeable” turned out to be his greatest asset. A flashier guy may have not been able to hide a Jew in his basement for almost two years during the Holocaust. Hans has true strength of character as shown by his acts of resistance against the Nazi’s and his willingness to risk everything for a Jew, which in those days could have only meant death.<br/><br/> “His soul sat up. It met me. Those kinds of souls always do – the best ones. The ones who rise up and say “I know who you are and I am ready.Not that I want to go, of course, but I will come.” Those souls are always light because more of them have been put out. More of them have already found their way to other places.”<br/><br/>I could keep quoting this book forever but at some point words are just words. What’s more important is that you remember and believe.<br/><br/>Remember that humanity is capable of good even in the worst situations.<br/><br/>Believe that amidst sorrow, there is joy. Amidst darkness, there is light. Amidst Death, there is always Life.
 Death is the narrator.  Yes, I know that is unconventional.  But wait, it's not as bad as you think.  Death makes quite a few observations of the human race, and he knows us well.  In this book, he looks back on his excursions surrounding the life of a German orphan girl, her foster parents, her neighbors, and her best friend, and what befell them during the hysteria of Hitler's reign in WWII Germany.  Liesel did not know how to read, but was fascinated by books.  The books she steals and collects, and the lives and deaths she intersected with are narrated by words and their meanings.  The final chapters of the book will bring tears to your eyes, yet it is a story about love, friendship, survival and memories.
 Remarkable use of language creates new and provocative imagery, yet still an easy read. The character development is whole and true. The story line amidst Nazi Germany is compelling but not overwhelming. A beautiful book. I'm so happy I chose to read it before seeing the movie. And now the movie can wait. I prefer to allow the novel to continue resonating.
 This is the greatest book I've ever read.  The writing was simply fantastic and the story was inspiring.  It really gives  you insight into what life was like during WWII not just for the Jews but the Germans as well.  I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone and I predict that I will read it many times in the future.
 THE BOOK THIEF is an eerily dramatic tale narrated by Death. Before the first book is ever stolen, Death comes stealing. While it may sound morbid, this is an intriguing tale about stolen books, stolen kisses, and stolen lives in Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>The book thief learns to read and reread the stolen books for renewed hope, entertainment, reflection and edification. The characters of Himmel Street - Hans, Rosa, Liesel, Rudy, Max and others - will steal your hearts, but they will leave you with endearing, heartwarming memories that remain long after the story is finished.<br/><br/>I recommend this novel for mature, young and adult readers who are daring enough to take the train ride to the town of Molching and endure the journey through pre-war and wartime Germany. I listened to the audiobook, and the voices remain etched upon my memory.
 I had seen the movie at the theater and thought it was OK. Reading the book though was so much better in that there was much more in-depth character development.  The insight provided for each character and the interactions between characters was so powerful in the book
 This is one of the best books I have read in the last year. I have recommended it to my mother-in-law. We have watched the movie too. (Not as good as the book. Are they ever?) But my husband did like the movie and didn't read the book. This is the story of a German girl during WWII. The writing style is brilliant.
 I didnt expect this story. It  was a great reading experience. Loved the characters and of course HATED THE NAZIS AS USUAL  but this wasnt the usual nazi book. Written from a little german girls point of view and how there were good germans trying to help but also afraid. Every character was fully fleshed out
 This is a good book in many ways.  The device of having death tell it is good, and "death" has some good insights.  There are also some scenes that are very moving, but perhaps less because of the author and more because of what we already know about Nazi Germany.  In the end, the characters and the book really go nowhere, even if it is a somewhat enjoyable read.
 To know that children, innocent children, once lived in such a time, surrounded by the cruelty and hatred that was Nazi Germany during WWII, is unimaginable to me. Zusak portrays a young girl who uses words as her escape and refuge, and ultimately her salvation, during this shameful part of humanity's history. An ugly time written beautifully.
 I loved this book and can't stop thinking about it.  I have told so many people about it that I hope they decide to read it.  Next up: the movie.  I've been told that it is very faithful to the book.  I can't say enough good things about this book - I loved the way it was written.  One of my new favorites...
 This was a selection for our book club and I so enjoyed reading this story.  There is so much about Nazi Germany that I do not remember studying in school that when I read a book like The Book Thief and Sarah's Key, it makes me want to do research into Nazi Germany and to learn more.  This is an excellent book for both adults and young people.  One of the ladies was going to give it to her 19 year old grandson to read to help him understand better about tolerance.
 To have a glimpse of the war-torn  Germany from the eyes of young people (and those around them), in very traumatic situations, ( living in Germany and pretending to follow the maniac, Hitler), was a new twist on an old story, for me.  I've read stories of Europeans hiding Jews, yet really never felt I knew the "keepers very well," only the "hidden."<br/>The written descriptions, the poetic nuances and the ability to still keep to the storyline is "genius."
 Excellent.  Highly recommended.  A three dimensional view of the life of a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany.  Suitable for adolescents and adults.  Perhaps for readers as young as junior high.
 You hear the horrors of what the Jews endured during the holocast, but not often do you hear how the holocaust affected the Germans.  I loved hearing the story of this young girl growing up during that time and all the trials she went through all because one man thought there was a superior race. So much loss for so many.  A truly sad time in history!!
 This book touch my heart better than a love story . It was written with determination of truth, strength &amp;  love. Love was not given in kisses &amp;  hugs but with knowledge &amp; kindness &amp;  knowing the simplicity is more valuable then riches. Kindness &amp; thoughtful &amp; dedication are gifts to be treasured forever, for those gifts stay with you forever &amp; no one can take them from you.
 This is a captivating story, and the reader for the audiobook, which is what I purchased, is excellent. Never had trouble keeping track of events or chronology. The story is set in Germany at the outbreak of the events leading to WWII, and has many upsetting/unsettling episodes, beautifully told.
 The stories in this book shift around a little, but I think that adds to the interest. It is set during the WWII and holocaust. It is a page turner. I love the different way it was written, narrated by none of the main characters, but an important character. I recommend it!
 I rarely post on Facebook but I did for this book. This book is filled with words, yet I find it difficult to find the words to describe this book. The characters stay with you, even when you are done reading it. You will smile, cry, laugh out loud and many, many other emotions. I dreaded setting it down. It is rare you read a book like this. After you read it, I hope you too post a review. It kind of completes you after reading it.
 One of the best books I have ever read!
 Markus, I would love to thank you for this amazing book. I am Jewish and although my mum told me a lot about her life during the war in Hungary I never really connected emotionally what it meant to be Jewish and to defend Jews. I loved the language also. I loved Death being the narrator.  I loved every single word, every single character. their humanity, their depth their complexity. I loved how love is not black and white. Probably the best book I ever read.
 This is a funny, moving, exhilarating, masterpiece of a book. The two principal characters are so real I could virtually smell Han's habitual cigarettes and hear his mistaken notes on the squeeze-box. Hans is a very ordinary man, but of quite extra-ordinary humanity. He is Atticus Finch with more fun and less education. I read the final chapter with a lump in my throat, but closed the book with a smile in my heart.<br/><br/>A book to treasure for a life time.
 This is one of the best books I have ever read. I had a hard time putting it down.  I sat in utter stillness and awe as I finished the book.  I thought it was profound and stunning.  Through the eyes of Liesel, the main character, I experienced a story about WWII and Nazi Germany in a way I had never experienced it before.  The fact that the book is narrated by Death is a clever and interesting twist.  Liesel, Rudy, Hans, Max...and, yes, Death....I shall never forget you and I thank you for your courage and your lives.  Bravo!!
 The Book Thief is an outstanding read and one that I shall retain forever in my memory.  It's prose is quiet but forceful. It's  one of the best books I've read in a long time. If you want a story that is out of the ordinary and makes you think and feel emotions, this is it.  I highly recommend this book to one and all discerning readers.
 I saw the movie first and it was remarkable. The absolute beauty of the original story, the exquisite writing - all from the vantage point of death itself was a gift to aching hearts everywhere. I am happy to read a story that is written about the ordinary German people, many of whom were victims of Hitler just as were the Jews.
 This book has an unusual narrator and as such, gives an uncommon perspective of events. It also provided a window into what life might have been like in a small German town during the war.  I loved the metaphors and insightful descriptions of everything from the weather to emotions.  The book is definitely worth the read!
 It was little strange and the beginning to figure out who was the narrator but it wasn't long before you know. I thoroughly enjoyed this unusual style.<br/>It was also good to read about a child growing in Germany as it was sinking into the dark hours.<br/><br/>Will recommend it not only to adults but also to teenagers so that can learn what it really means being hungry, dealing with adults' problems, yet still remaining child's innocence and integrity
 I enjoyed the book.  It was well thought out.  the accurate details and emotions portrayed made you feel like you were actually there going through each moment with each of the characters.  A must read.  The book is WAY better than the movie.
 The young girl who is fascinated by books and goes through many adventures to procure them........in the surprising setting of Nazi infiltration to her area and life.......I haven't yet seen the movie, but the book is a moving picture of the<br/>time and the people........
 Unique and totally engrossing read.
 Historically accurate, and non-slandering.  Wonderful picture of how kind and how ferocious humans can be.  One item of note, it most clearly captures the evil of indifference, especially that of good people.  Hans, Alex, Rosa, Liesel, and Rudy...notably held the line and beat indifference back into the hole of hell where it belongs.
 One of the best books I have ever read, ever! I was hooked from the first sentence, and could not stop reading! I will not reval the story. I am sure thr reader has a good isea. The charachtars came alive in my mind, and they still reside there a year later. A must-read for anyone!
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which was recommended to me by a young reader. It speaks of the hero's journey in a war stricken world, and portrays the reallity that things do not always turn out the way you either hope or expect them to. I would recommend this to every avid reader just for the experience of something unique and precious.
 Read this book awhile ago and it is still with me. Will read it again this summer.
 Captivating! Emotional rollercoaster...thought about the characters for days. Immediately have to see the movie.  Not quite as good as the book. I have suggested this book to several friends.  One I won't forget for a very long time.
 I loved this book! The beginning felt drawn out and like it took a bit to get into the story, but it was well worth it. It tapped into every emotion beautifully. Readers can experience all of the highs and lows as if they are living in this WWII story. Heartbreaking, yet full of hope. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!!!
 A very well written book.  I must take exception to it being called a children's book.  Even for teenagers, the subject is very unsettling and grim.  It has its lighter moments, but for the most part is a very dark story about a very dark time in history.
 Took me a few pages/chapters to get a feel for who the story was being told by, but once that was determined, it was beautifully Sad.  Great story and truly inspiring, heartbreaking, and honest.
 This is a great book, and not one I would have immediately recommended to children simply because it is quite violent and very sad. Perhaps for older middle schoolers and highschoolers. I think what makes it so good is that is presents the horror of the Holocaust and WWII from multiple points of view, illustrating that both Germans and Jews suffered at the hands of the Nazis.
 I felt like I was right there with the main character experiencing all of the wonder of learning to read, the stolen books as the most treasured of items.  The reader experienced her feelings of friendship and love of her foster parents, and close friends.  Her sorrow and helplessness at the persecution of the Jews by her own people was well written.  The book shared the tender years of a teenage girl; her first feelings for the boy next door; the heartaches of watching the adult male Jew whither away hiding in the family basement; the life experiences and horrors of Germany both pre and post war.
 I'm a nerd in a book club and I really liked this book, as did most of the members. You see WWII from a different perspective - a young girl in a small town in Germany. I'm also a sucker for good writing (as I'm sure a lot of people say they are), and the writing style and tempo was excellent.
 The book thief is a brillant and profound novel<br/>It's set in World War Two and it tell the story from lissels point of view through a narrator<br/>The characters are so realistic that you can almost see them jumping off the pages<br/>At times sad but not over sentimental and at times joyous<br/>A piece of inspired writing
 This is one of those books that make you sit and just think about life and humanity. This book was sweet and beautiful and Im glad the movie came out so that more people know about it. It had laughter and love and sorrow, everything you could want in a book. There are so many WWII stories, and i have read a lot of them, but this one is different. It is not about WWII and the holocaust even if it is about a girl living in NAZI Germany. I really recommend this book and will most likely be one of the book i reread from time to time.
 I can't remember when I've enjoyed a book written about and narrated by death more than this one.  I love words and the pictures drawn by the words in this book fascinated me from the beginning til the last one.  I know I will meditate on this story often and I will certainly recommend it many times.
 This book needs to be in every school library. Rich intense characters, in a time in history that changed the world for all of us. Everyone should read this book. Incredible.
 Having the book narrated by Death was brilliant. Much of the most thought provoking dialogue, for me, was that of the Narrator. I have read many books, written from varying perspectives, dealing with this particular period in history. I appreciated that Mr. Zusak's focus was on five central characters, which lent a very intimate perspective. The relationship between Leisel and her father was both heart warming and heart wrenching. Leisel, her father and mother, her best friend and Max will linger in your thoughts long after you've finished reading...
 As you read this book,many emotions and feelings pass through your mind.<br/>You are shocked but find time for love and laughter, tragedy is softened by<br/>beautiful acts of kindness and caring.  take time to learn so much and be grateful for what you<br/>have. even if you've seen the movie,this is a must.
 loved this book!  Well written and characters that develop throughout the story.<br/><br/>Will be looking for more from this author Markus Zusak!!
 It was good.  Flashes of pure insight into everyday life, what it was like when people did their best to subtlety help, and it was far from perfect.  In many ways the flawed desperate love was worth more than perfection. Loved the relationship,between actual living beings; not a fan of Death as a narrator, too comvenent.
 What a strange and wonderful story!  It was sad, funny and expressive and gave a quite different perspective on the German sacrifices during world war II.  I loved the narration by the persona of "death".  I thought the author, Marcus zusak did a brilliant job of creating a masterpiece.  It's the kind of novel to read more than once.
 Told from the perspective of the Grim Reaper, this story takes us on a journey through the trials and tribulations of a young girls life as she lives through the war. Beautifully told.
 This may be one of the Best Books I have ever read. I highly recommend it to everyone. Very moving.
 Our book club did this book last month. It is about a young girl who is taken to a foster home in Germany during the second World War. As the war becomes closer things began to happen in the little town in Germany. She is called a book thief because she finds books and reads them to herself and to others. It is a good story.
 Death is a cynical and weary narrator.  An unusual, but effective way to tell this story of death and survival in World War II Germany.  The characters are so well developed.  Loved the book.
 It isn't often that we find a book that is truly unique....but this is one of them. The story is told by Death, which in itself sets this book apart. The images of the characters remain with you long after the last page. I found it hard to put the book down and read it in about 3 evenings. I won't ruin the book by telling the story, but you will not be disappointed if you buy this book. I am sure that I will read more Zusak books.
 My students loved the audiobook. Narrator was well paced and did great character voices.
 It's sort of like Anne Frank from the other side. It shows that not all Germans were happily fulfilling the Fuhrer's wishes. It gives an excellent example of the power of words and the potential damage of censorship. It showcases what a difference the bravery of a few people doing what's right can make. Although I enjoyed the movie I am so glad I read the book first.
 Great story and so very well written!
 This book was difficult for me in the beginning. When I figured out the book was written from the point of view of Death, it finally made sense. After that, I would call it excellent. Although it is set in Germany during WWII, it is not a Holocaust book. It's a story of as young German girl, who through her stories and actions, comforts her family and neighbors during the war. It's her story and Death tells it well!
 I picked this book after a friend recommended it a few months ago. I wasn't sure if I would like it so I kept passing it over. I finally decided to give it a go. I read it almost non-stop from beginning to end! It is beautifully written, the characters are amazing, this book had me laughing and crying. I'm glad I finally read it.
 This book deserves the accolades it is receiving.  I think it will be a classic and should be required reading in any history or English class.  This is one book I have read twice, and of the hundreds of books I have read I can only say that about fewer than 10 to 12 books.  I highly recommend this book.
 It was a heartwarming, heart- stoppng tale of relationships, growth of love, and life in Nazi Germany for the common folk in a small German town.  A picture of their lives, interests, fears, depravity  and nobility. Not one we usually get.  Thge device of using death as the narrator worked so well and the language used to ell the tale was beautiful!
 This book was good but not the best thing I've ever read. Took quite some time before I really got into it. Definitely gives you an interesting historical fiction view on things in that time.
 I saw a trailer for the movie based on thus book and immediately knew I'd rather read the book.  I was hooked after only a few pages and though the subject matter was too horrible to fathom, The Book Thief kept me riveted.  I was torn between having to put it down to digest the words and not able to put it down because the words drew me along.
 Excellent book that arrived in tip-top condition!
 I loved reading this book. I bought it on a Kindle and I was a little unaware of the length, but I didn't end up minding in the long run.  The book captures you into the story of Liesel and her life during World War II in Nazi Germany. It was a great read, but with any story that takes place in Nazi Germany hearts are broken.
 The unique craft of this author's style enhances a absolutely riveting story, so realistic you swear you know all of the characters.  Death as the narrator......unnerving and lovingly sweet all in the same breath!  Live on, Leisel, Papa, Mama, golden haired Rudy, and our memory of the terrible tragedy of man's capability to hurt and to heal!
 i thought this book was going to be about some dude who stole books because they suck (#books) and i was totally ready to ride that train but it turns out it actually has a deep plot and stuff and that is way too complicated for me. there are no dick jokes, no racist undertones or metaphysical analysis of the wu tang clan, so it looks like im out.
 I have never read a  book for 200 pages and didn;t like it....this was a first. I was determined to  finish it becaue many said they  liked it. I finished it but it was the hardest read I have had that I finished. I usually quit and wanted to many times in this book,. The ending was the only part I liked!!
 Read the book and saw the movie.  I liked it because it gave the other  side of the story of how the Germans and Jews  had to live during the War.  The story was very intimate and gave insight into their lives.  I was left caring a lot for Liesel and Max and wonder if it was him that came to the door and asked for her toward the end of the book and if they married.  Great read!!!<br/>Love novels based on real events and truths.
 I read The Book Thief when it was first published in the US, I loved it then and I love it more now. My book club is reading this book for our January meeting and half of the club have already read it and want to read it again. I believe/hope this will be one of our best discussions to date. I chose to read this book because of all the awards and reviews it received in Europe.  Yes, the story line takes place in Nazi Germany and can be very difficult and disturbing. However, the story is not about the evil. It is a beautiful story.The writing is superb!!!!
 So many books are written about The Holocaust and the atrocities of the Nazis on the persecuted Jewish population.  This book however, is written about a young girl adopted by a poor German couple and their lives while World War 2 rages around them... A different and sad perspective on The War showing how The common Germans lived their lives during the turmoil.  If you liked "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas", you'll love this.
 What a powerful story about the war, depicting the  pain and suffering that everyone suffered. Focusing on the children and how they cope with one  tragedy after another. It is beautifully written and focuses on the beauty found in literature Narrated by a "unbiased observer", it is well worth the read.
 My son loved the book
 The very best book of the year for me.  I immediately gave my favorite possession (my Kindle) to someone so that they could start reading this book within minutes of finishing it.  I just had to have someone else enjoy this masterpiece.
 I would call this a wonderful story, but it;s a bit grim for that<br/>That said it is a wonderful mostly sad but with some funny moments story. I will not reveal the plot nor the story line, but if you love reading a good story ,wiping a tear or two in laughter or in grief (empathy) Then you should give this a try. it's really worth it.
 Zusak tells the story of a time that has been written about a million times, but never quite like this.  He takes the reader on a journey back that brings you straight to Nazi Germany.  It is told from an unlikely perspective of a young girl whose life is full of love and sadness; joy and pain.  I loved the way the story is told, loved the story itself!
 This book is the best writing I have read in a long time. Death is the narrator who uses metaphoric phrases to describe both characters and settings.<br/>The setting is NatziGermany near the end of World War ll. An eleven year-old girl is placed with a foster family. The father is my favorite character.<br/> You will like this book because it describes LlFE in both war and the every-day interactions.  BET
 This book was one of the most unusual stories that I have ever read.  I found it at times a little difficult to follow, but for the most part it was hard to stop reading.  The fact that this book showed WW II Germany from  German families perspective was both eye opening and sad.  I'm sure that the Jewish people of the world can relate to this tragic time better than me.  On the other hand, most of us have been through difficult times in our life, but, in most cases, nothing as horrific as what this story covers.
 A brilliantly told story of Germany during WWII from the point of view of a little girl who accepted what she saw and did not question.  Told by "death" who was everywhere and was the observer, was also chilling.  I will definitely be recommending this book to others, especially for those who believe war is a good thing.
 This is an excellent book.  It's a very moving account of a young girl during the nazi regime, who is adopted by foster parents after her father dies, her little brother dies and her mother is taken away for political reasons.  This story is a moving testament to the strength, love and forbearance of this child and her new family as they do their best to survive in Germany during the Hitler regime.  It is a unique, well written story.
 Not just for young adults--in fact, this book was released in Europe as an adult title--The Book Thief is a classic-in-the-making. Some have compared it as a cross between Slaughterhouse Five and The Diary of Anne Frank, and it has similarities between both.<br/>Death is the narrator of this novel about a pre-teen girl living in a small town near Munich at the start of World War II. The historical detail is absorbing, as is the girl's coming-of-age story. Death, as a cordial--but not kind--observer, keeps the action not quite so disturbing because, as he says in the beginning, we all die. He foretells the events in The Book Thief, but we know that he will be there to gather each person's soul, as he does for us all.
 I have this in book form, kindle form , and audiobook. It is simply an unforgettable story of a Jew hidden<br/>by an Aryan  family and the deprivations of a German town under Hitler. Complex emotions by the adults, but simple humanity in the young who redeem some of the brutality.
 This was not your run of the mill YA book!  It was very different and gives an account of life for people in Germany during WWII.  For those left in small towns after the Jews were removed, life was not easy.  The insight that the author has and the way in which the author choses to tell this story was very unusual.  I didn't think I would like at the start but I kept with it and started to see the point that the author had intended.  Kudos to Mr. Zusak!
 I got this book for my "historical fiction" collection on my kindle and at first I wasn't sure that it fit. But it certainly did. The way the author tells the story, from the point of the Grim Reaper, is completely awesome. Not to mention that the story is touching. I highly recommend not only the book but also the author, Markus Zusak. I just ordered a few more books from him, I was that impressed by The Book Thief.
 The Book Thief is a great great read, one of the best I’ve read in a long time, I did see the movie that<br/>Inspired me to download the book on my E-book and once I started it was hard to put in down. I highly<br/>Recommend it.
 Another book club read. This was a great book. The time and place descriptions took you right back to the horrible things that occurred during the timeline of the second world war. That being said, although the story bouncing back and forth at the beginning was hard to follow, once you got into it, we all really enjoyed the book.
 Going into it, you know that a story about the Holocaust and Nazi Germany isn't going to have a happy, bubbly ending. It was a well written book that I liked and cried through. The author's descriptive abilities and sense of timing are not like books I've read before. The character's are beautifully flawed and the story is compelling.
 I've always wondered how the people of Germany lived and how they felt about things.  This book gives you a picture of the different people and how they felt.  As the war started with some shortages,  it could not have been easy.  This young girl show how to exist in a from-one-day-to-the-next situation.
 "***HERE IS A SMALL FACT***You are going to die...I'm nothing if not fair," starts Death himself's narration of this perfectly written novel about Liesel, an illiterate, German orphan girl, who struggles with the death of her younger brother as she tries to assimilate into her new life on, ironically,  Himmel (Heaven) Street.  With her father, who is shunned by the Nazi party for his sympathetic actions toward Jews, she learns to read the books she steals, while befriending some unlikely characters.  Death - witty, prophetic and ever-present, takes the reader on an amazing journey through her life during the time of the Holocaust.
 I decided to get this book rather than see the movie. There were numerous unseen twists and turns, some delightful, others quite sad. I did enjoy the point of view, the idea of death as the story teller. I still have not seen the movie, but I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
 We saw the movie during the Thanksgiving holidays, and I immediately ordered the book.  We could really relate to Liesel (the main character) as my mother-in-law, now deceased, grew up in a small village in eastern Germany and was the same age as Liesel during the war.  The story is definitely true to the times and very emotionally moving.  WWII set the stage and controlled the action, but every day on the home front has to be lived, too.
 Read The Book Thief if you love books about the Holocaust, coming of age, purpose-driven living, and death.<br/>Flowing with vignettes so real, you are bound to be transported, this book is presented from the perspective of death. Yes, death, who jokes about our human perception of his arrival sporting a sickle. Death as narrator, wonderful! Wish I had thought of it, but I didn't. Read it.
 This is a dark book, but it addresses WW II and Nazi invasions, so there is no getting around the dark subject matter. The writing is fantastic, as is the character development and story line. You want everything to turn out rainbows and butterflies, but you know it can't. I'm not a weeping reader, but this book drew tears. Dive in and appreciate the material, root for the main character, and be thankful you won't have to make any of the characters' choices and decisions.
 I highly recommend this book!
 This a book that would benefit both young and old alike.  It was a wonderful book.  I previously read it about 5 years ago and enjoyed it even more a second time, just recently.  The relationship shared between Leisel - the book theif and her foster father was precious.  While their were many sad moments it was a page turner and for many I am sure a mind opener.
 How do you put into words a book that draws you in to the lives of people and makes you love them? I have always contemplated whether I would have the courage of The Book Thief and her family to protect someone with my life in such a dark time.  We all would like to think that would be us but we really don't know.  I did not hurry through this book.  It require my time to absorb everything in it.  When you are sad that a book has ended, that is a great read!
 ...that there were decent, principled German people caught up in the Holocaust.  As a Jewish female brought up in the 50's to despise anything German (e.g, no Jew would be caught dead buying a Volkswagen), this portrait of a deeply humane German family was a good antidote to that unfortunate but deeply rooted habit of mind.
 Nazis and Jews. You would think that this is another boring book, but its not.<br/>Its a great book for all ages that can actually understand this book. Its told by Death, and represents Death in an unique way. The first page will just grab you completely and utterly.<br/>You actually can care for the characters that are portrayed in the book, and is a great, but a bit long of a read, being 550 pages.
 I was loaned a hardback copy of The Book Thief when it first came out, and loved it.  After seeing the film, which was wonderfully done and very close to the book, I wanted to read it again.  And like the title character, I want to own books I love, so I bought the Kindle edition.  It was even better the second time.  The only slight problem is that the illustrations (very important to the story) are a bit too small and don't increase in size even when increasing the font size on the Kindle.  This book is a must for anyone who loves words, books, and clever writing.  Also for anyone (like me) who is interested in WWII-era history and stories.  Excellently written and moving without being overly sentimental or sugary.  A wonderful book.
 Unfortunately, I saw the movie before I ordered and read the book but it was worth it because the movie leaves out so much of the book. It was a book that has stayed with me long after I read it. It's a very easy and pleasurable read; it was so good I finished it in two days.
 Fast shipping and as advertised. Thank you!
 This is among the best books I have ever read in my six decades of doing so.  Thank you, markus zusak.
 'The Book Thief' by Markus Zusak is no doubt the best book that I have ever read. I would recommend it to any adult (as long as they are prepared to cry- a lot!). The concept of the book is so interesting, as it is set in Nazi Germany and is narrated by 'death'. Most people tend to have a mixture of confusion and intrigue on their face when I mention this fact, hence the interesting and original concept. It doesn't sound like the most appealing book when trying to describe it as you cannot say much without giving it away. The only thing to do is ask that person to trust you when you say it is one of the best books to read.<br/>The style of the writing is what makes this book so wonderful. There is a huge amount of use of imagery, metaphors, similes and alliteration.<br/>I urge every adult out there to read this book. It is one you will never forget!
 I loved, loved, loved this book the first time I read it. I thought how great it would be for my sophomore World Literature class. And then, surprize! it was on the list for the new Common Core Standards! We got enough copies for a class set and my students LOVED it. Death as a narrator is intriguing for them and they really were able to relate to Liesel, the main character.<br/>I would recommend this book to any teacher. There are not a ton of lesson plans out there for it, but sometimes you just have to read and discuss good literature, so that's what we did.
 I thought this book was good. The words were the right ones, in the right order. I would recommend this book to others.
 One of the best books I've read in a long time. Absolutely convincing, I was sucked in from the very beginning. While death as the narrator should be macabre and morose, it was quite beautifully done. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie. I hope Mr. Zusak writes more books like this.
 It took me about 40 pages to get into this book. I started it once then started it again. Once I finally got the jest of the beginning, I couldn't put it down. I listened to the narrator the 2nd time around for the first 6-10 minutes and that really helped me come to grips with the "actual" way the book was supposed to be read and was written.
 One of those rare reads that kept my attention through to the end; yet hated to see it come to an end.  The concept of "death" summing up human beings and their peculiarities makes for interesting reading.  I kept hoping something good would happen to this young girl who was wise beyond her years.
 This was a good read and would recommend it to anyone looking for a different perspective on WWII.  Its about love, loss and how the children coped with the horrors of that war.  Its about the power of words and how a young girl learns that books can be one's salvation.
 The Book Thief was a reading selection for our book club.  It is beautifully written, and so sad.  Explains the humanity of some Germans who resisted Nazi ideals and helped the Jews, told by Death as the narrator.  The book is rich and wonderful.  A good book to be discussed by a group.
 I just finished reading it and the only I can say is you have to read it. There are many stories of Nazi Germany, but this is one that just grabbed me and drew me in. It is beautifully written- and it is a page turner. It made me reflect at the same time I couldn't wait( and sometimes dreaded) to find out what would happen next. I haven't seen the movie, but I don't think it would have spoiled the book.<br/>The Book Thief  should be require reading for high school lit. classes.<br/>I highly recommend it.
 every word is plucked, raised, transmuted . . . watered, trimmed . . . . the idea, the phrasing . . . .masterful.<br/>10 stars.<br/>i have been looking forward to future writings.  problem : he is deathly afraid of his craft, his art, his success.<br/><br/>please please finish.  this is a tour-de-force.<br/>if beethoven felt this same way . . . . . we would not have an off-shoot of musical history.<br/><br/>come on !!!!!!!!!
 Seeing Hitler's Germany through the eyes of Liesel, and narrated by Death, made The Book Thief a captivating, haunting, and ultimately up-lifting read.  While Death seems ever-present, Love is there as well.  It is in the wisdom and tenderness of her foster father, as well as the heart, if not the tongue, of her foster mother.  It is in the devotion of Rudy and the sacrifice of Max.  It is in the triumph of the human spirit in a world beyond horrific.
 I did enjoy this book quite a bit. It's message is strong, the writing emotional, and I was completely drawn into the story. The writing is simple and easy to understand, and I realized as I read it that my children had been assigned the book in 5th grade.  That made me wonder, was it written as a children's book? That would explain the tone and the writing style.
 This is a lovingly written coming of age story of a young girl who has had more than her share of suffering before she reached her teens.  Her pain will continue throughout the story.  Yet her humanity and connections with all those around her draws you in and you won't want to let go.<br/>The author tells you much of what will happen at the beginning of the book.  A less skilled writer would have lost me as a reader after that.  Afterall, we all know the first rule of writing fiction is "Show, don't tell."  Zusak breaks rules and draws you in and you never want to let go of his characters.<br/>I would recommend this book to anyone over 15.
 With all that has been written about World War II, I have never read anything focussing on life for the German people much less focusing on a German child.  It is not preachy, but possibly because of the character of Death as narrator, it moves along with no judgments.  Yet, the humanity in the characters is evident.  There is no storybook ending, yet as in life, all of the pieces fit together. I wanted to know these characters and cared about them.
 Ohhhh, I simply loved this book.  I fell in LOVE with Leisal (I may have misspelled her name, it was awhile ago now, since I read it) but her name, as different as it is, stuck with me.  You will fall in love with her, and you will fall in love with Max &amp; Papa.  Trust me, read this book.  You won't be disappointed!
 World War II... Nazi Germany...  Death as a narrator...  A little girl trying to make the best of a bad situation...  The Book Thief is an excellent read that puts a twist on a well-documented moment in time.  Balancing fact and fiction, M. Zusak weaves a tale that is magical, frightening, and so human.  If you are even remotely interested in the history of World War II, you will love this book.  It will make you laugh, cry, and contemplate the precariousness of life.
 Now I don't usually read for fun, but when I do read it's for class. But for real though this book was lit. I actually liked it. Kudos to my teacher for assigning it
 Beautifully written story. There is such power in words, as Leisl discovered, and this author is gifted with the ability to pack powerful emotion into his writing. There is a two sentence paragraph near the end of this book that nearly ripped my heart out with its power &amp; simplicity. Just a beautiful story. It made me grateful for the ability to read.
 The author writes this story of Nazi Germany and the citizens of that country from the perspective of Death.  Death winds the tale with words with double entendre in ironic form.  It is hard to read the struggle of innocent good people but absolutely necessary.  Lest we ever forget all the victims of the Nazi regime.
 It took a while to get the rhythms of how the story was told but once i got into it i absolutely lovely. It made me cry how our lives can be so devastatingly affected by the choices that others do. I would have loved for leisel and rudy to have been able to survive the bombing together but even though that wasnt the case her last minute kiss was toughing. Definitely worth reading i loved it
 What makes this book so interesting is that it is written from the perspective of Death personified which is so fitting for one of the most horrendous times in history. It is a story of survival and conviction of all of the characters, flaws and all. I liked the story, but save 5 stars for those books I just cannot put down.
 This was one of those books I hated to put down!  You become so attached to the characters especially the book thief.  The story told so much about the characters and their struggles in Germany during world war two.  This is a very touching book and one you will not forget after you finish it.
 Book that reaches into the heart and soul. It stays with you for a long time because of the a author's incredible writing g style where every character and scenario feel real
 It was written by the angel of death which was very odd. I had to keep that in mind as the view and perspective were different. I found it to be a good historical fiction of what living in Germany at the time of Hitler must have been like. It's probably not for everyone since it is a serious book but I enjoyed.
 My whole package came a day early, and this book was kept in a GREAT condition. I wanted to read this book because I loved the movie and knowing how it usually goes, the book provides a bit more detail than the movie. I'm most likely going to cry from reading this.
 Beautiful, frightening, touching.....a must read...<br/>Liesel, Rudy, Max, and Hans were wonderful characters. Mr. Zusak really knows how to tell a story
 This book was written like none other - having "death" as the narrator - ingenious.  Although the subject matter was dark the narrator "death"  was compassionate, witty and even humorous while still being respectful to the seriousness of the book.  The format of each title page - again... ingenious.  It was so differently written - I absolutely loved it.  Wish more books were presented this way.
 This was a real page turner.......didn't want to put the book down until I was finished.  I'm hoping there will be a part two now.<br/>Can't wait to see the movie to see if it's anything like the book.  Hope you enjoy the book as much as I did.  It's written a little different but once you understand that you will really enjoy the story.
 It took me awhile to finish this book, but I'm so glad I did.  Reading about life in the 1940's in Germany, through the eyes of the the book thief and death, I truly do not think there could be anything worse than what they endured.  I hear people saying how awful times are now, which don't get me wrong the human race has plenty to be ashamed of now.  I believe there are very few of us that have the spirit and fight to endure true tragedy.  I admire Lisiel, an amazing character, you will fall  in love with each of the characters of this book.  I loved Lisiel's eagerness to learn to read and how she fell in love with the words and stories.  How amazing would it be to be so enthralled with every book you could get your hands on?
 This book is love: a love of words, a love of life.  It gives an important perspective to a world that can be cruel, can be evil, but shows the beauty and yes, the good, that can overwhelm and replace the ugliness.  I would recommend it to older adolescents because it can alter their perspective on life and counter the so-called modern perspectives that they are being exposed to in other "literature" that is being presented to them.  This is a book for all adults to enjoy also, and what a different view of Death it gives!  It stimulates our thought processes!  Please enjoy it!
 Interesting use of voice in construction.  And the tale becomes more and more compelling and draws you into the characters.  On the face of it the story is very ordinary about extraordinary times.  But it is so much more than that once you go deeper into the story. The characters are compellingly real.
 Our book club read the "Book Thief" in January, 2014.  We all liked it.  The appeal of the book, to me, was the historical, well-written prose with a twist.  The narrator (death) caught your attention from the first and used colors to describe the days and events of German life before and during World War II.  The relationships of family members, neighbors and enemies were complicated and well thought out.  Music, reading, writing and art united the characters and gave them a realism that we could all relate to.  I would recommend it to a mature reader.
 This book will be a true classic.  Death, the narrator, takes you through an amazing tale of humanity at its worst and best.  This book gives real insight into all the people involved. There is no sitting in judgement, just the revealing of truth. I refuse to see the movie because the book is a stand alone work of art.
 I truly enjoyed this book. I wasn't sure that I would as I, like many don't like to think of war. However, the characters in this story grabbed my heart. Markus Zusak did a fabulous job painting the picture of war torn Germany. More than that,the people who endured this horrible time in world history.  I could see the basement and the homes they lived in. The beauty and the tragedy were so profound. A Must Read!<br/>Would highly recommend to everyone!
 It touches the heart in so many ways. To think "death" is the one telling the story. Beautifully written! Day after finishing reading the book,<br/>watched the movie.... Movie great, but needless to say book fantastic....
 I was told by a cousin to drop everything and read this book five years ago.  I ignored her then, but I shouldn't have!  The Book Thief has left a permanent mark on my soul as one of the great stories of the survival of the human spirit that I've ever encountered.  It is rich and complex, and the story unfolds in ways you wouldn't expect.  An absolute must-read!
 Depressingly good read.  As with most WWII Nazi-era novels, the heavy reminders of this blighted time in history make the journey through this story a not-so-pleasant trudge through facts and terrors we often choose not to remember.  The heroine is a tragic figure, but complex and an interesting mix of optimism and fate in an atmosphere teeming with reality.
 This was an interesting book that I found hard to put down.  I finished this book in just a few days because once you get into the story, it is a compelling read.  I would recommend this book to those who are interested in History during the rise of Hitler.  It is written from a different and interesting point of view.
 Excellent fiction-historical book. I wish all people interested in WWll will buy this book to understand what was taking place just before the war started.  This author's mastery of telling a beautiful but sad story is so poignant it makes us realize the sufferings the Jewish people went through. I loved this book with all my heart.
 Could not put this book down. Even though future events in the story are given away earlier, I still could not stop reading. Reinforces the heartening fact that the humanity of some people triumphed over even the catastrophic holocaust. A realistic look at how children, who are left to think for themselves, view world changing events.
 great read. movie is made from this book
 This book was so engrossing, I finished it in three days.  I rarely come across a book where I get so attached to a character and absolutely, positively must find out what happens to him/her.  The Book Thief is such a book.  It gives gripping insight into what it must have been like to live in Germany under Hitler's rule, and the risks people took to protect the innocent Jews from his madness.  I give it five stars.
 Hitler was a monster!  This is a story of one little girl who survived the horrors of Nazi Germany aided by words!  It is a beautiful and moving story of a young girl, so very poor but so very rich in so many ways.  Told from the viewpoint of Death makes it extremely unusual but very interesting.  This is a must read.
 One of the most beautifully written books I've ever read. I re-read line after line just to enjoy the beauty of the words put together. An absolute treat of a book.
 I love all books about this era and this was just one of the most interesting ones I've read. I love the way that the store is told and I couldn't get enough. A friend and I bought this (after we both have read it) for a friend who is studying abroad in Ghana. We figured it was a nice long book for her to pass the time.
 I never saw the movie, so I didn't have the movie as a reference as what to expect when I read the book.  I loved the book.  It gives an intriguing point of view of Germany when Hitler was in power - at least to a little girl.
 This book has no climax. After a slow start, it twisted and turned and broke my heart only to mend it, then break it even more a few pages later. There is no happy ending when  talking about this piece of human history. In this book the author can only show us those glimmers of hope that give us faith in humanity. I really don't think I will want to see the movie...it's enough to see myself in Liesel and imagine what I would do in her shoes. It is the first book in a long time that made my heart race and eyes well. I can't give it 5 stars though, nothing this painful can be perfect.
 How to explain the exquisite beauty of this novel about a girl in WW2 Germany?  Well , it is about love, the power of words both written and spoken, hatred, war, family, friendship, life and death.  Read this book and  it will snatch you up and take you away, and you will never forget it.
 Well written and good story line.  Gave a glimpse into the German mind of everyday people and what they had to go through to survive the war without diminishing the suffering of the Jews during that time. However, this was really a story about a girl who loved books and the written word that just happened to be during WWII in Germany.
 I loved this book!  To me it was an upbeat (somewhat) Diary of Anne Frank.  I loved that the characters showed love for each family member and others in and around their village.  The narrator drew me into the plot...sounded gentle, and contributed much to the overall theme/feel of the book.
 I always think one should see the film before one reads the book, as there is always more in the book.  I was not able to do so this time as I read the book early, but everyone is raving about the film and I am about to go and see it.  I love the way the book unfolds as if one is growing with the child and her realisation of what is happening is also unfolding as the book progresses.
 Markus Susan has a beautiful writing style.  I enjoyed every minute of this book.  He made me laugh and made me cry.<br/><br/>He brought to life the hardships suffered by the German people and their inner strength to do what is right in spite of Hitler, through the eyes of a Book Thief.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book.
 While it took me awhile to become engrossed in the story, once I did I found it to be a moving tale.  From the first death of a brother through stories of growing up to finally the horrors of war the book thief memorably tells a story of family, friends, love, learning, promises, integrity and losses.  Well worth the read.
 I loved the story, the writing.  I watched the movie after reading the book.  Was so disappointed at how they butchered it.  READ THE BOOK!
 The story is narrated by Death, who is out collecting souls.  Mainly it concerns Liesel Meminger and the people around her - in particular her foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, her particular friend, Rudy Steiner, and a Jew in hiding, Max Vandenburg.  The story starts in 1939 when 9-year-old Liesel (not quite ten) arrives on Himmel Street in Molching, a town on the outskirts of Munich.  It continues through the war years to 1943, as people struggle to survive, men from the town are sent to the Eastern Front in Russia, and Death strips away people around Liesel.  Along he way Liesel steals books and learns to read and write.  It skips forward with an Epilogue to the end of the war in 1945, and ends with Liesel in Australia, the home country of the author.<br/><br/>Along the way you will get a good picture of life in a small town in Nazi Germany during the war.
 It's an ok read, better suited to pre-teens and middle schoolers. It puts a happy and hopeful face on some tragic periods in history. Got tiresome reading the italicized foreign words "sourkraut" or "soccerball" or some such. I didn't finish the book, will hopefully get back to it sometime.
 I have not seen the movie but being a reader thought this book sounded interesting.<br/>I really felt I had an insight into what Germans felt about Hitler and youth and adults.<br/>The beginning of the book, I had to go back and reread understand who the narrator was.
 I read the book first, which gave me a little more background when viewing the movie.  Couldn't wait to get Bach to the book while reading. It was a great movie and both it and the book will stay with me a long time. The photography in movie was outstanding. Certainly recommend both book and movie.
 A book about how suffering is conquered with a strong heart and belief in persistence and humor in trying circumstances.  A truly good look into how a child comes to grip with tragedy, violence, and survives emotionally and physically.
 First the writing was so beautiful, the story so original, and interesting, made me want to cry. I would highly recommend this book. It's incredible!!
 It took me half the book to get into it and I  am so so glad I did. I cared about these characters so much. It's been a few days since I finished reading and I still think about them and the story and the beautiful writing. Definitely worth reading, even if the narration by Death is difficult for you to get into.
 "The Book Thief" by Markus Zusak is an unusual, highly creative, captivating, and darkly enchanting novel. It tells the story of four years in the life of Liesel Meminger, a foster child growing up in Nazi Germany during the last years of World War II. We watch her grow from a frightened child of nine to a disillusioned and angry teenager forced to come to terms not only with the inhumanity wrought by Hitler's Holocaust, but also with her community's participation in it. Liesel's life is an uncommon story--one filled with both beauty and brutality. It makes for a riveting and compelling tale, and few readers, even those who find fault with the narration, will fail to be entertained.<br/><br/>Liesel's life story is narrated by Death--a character who shares center stage along with the young girl as one of the book's most endearing and unforgettable protagonists. Death has a distinct fascination for this child. He rescues her autobiography from a garbage truck, and admits to having reread it thousands of times in an attempt to understand humanity. In the beginning of the novel, Death tells us: "in one of my vast array of pockets, I have kept her story to retell. It is one of the small legion I carry, each one extraordinary in its own right. Each one an attempt--an immense leap of an attempt--to prove to me that you, and your human existence, are worth it."<br/><br/>The language of the narrative is brilliant in its originality. What makes this possible is the otherworldly point-of-view that Death brings to the narration. Through Death's eyes, our human world is seen anew with distinctly fresh and vivid prose. Death does not appreciate the difference between animate and inanimate objects, between people and things--thus his narration is filled with countless richly original metaphors that entertain (and yes, sometimes distract) the reader at almost every paragraph. Take these phrases for example: passengers "slide" out of a train "as if from a torn package;" a man wears "a face with the shades pulled down;" a woman "empties  her] words out into the sink;" books stand upright on a table "as if in conversation;" two words of regret are "giants" that a girl "struggles with, carries on her shoulder, and drops as a bungling pair at" a woman's feet; an exchange of gunfire is "a conversation of bullets;" and kind words "drop out of  a man's] mouth like jewels." There is enormous reading pleasure to be had between the pages of this book merely by experiencing the narrator's richly creative prose.<br/><br/>"The Book Thief" is being marketed as a young-adult novel, but it can easily be enjoyed and appreciated by adults. Although the story unfolds against a background of immense historical inhumanity, Liesel's story is one of courage, goodness, integrity, and compassion.<br/><br/>This book has an overall fairy-tale-like quality, yet it deals with major themes concerning the human condition. I found this juxtaposition between the fairy-tale world and the real world jolting--for example, at times the character of Death entranced me, and at other times I felt his presence to be annoying and contrived. Also, the construction of the plot, although highly original, made it difficult for me to believe in the story or its themes. The author constructed the telling of Liesel's story to be twice removed from any adult reality: first, the story is written down by a young girl who naturally lacks a reliable understanding of the full breadth of human experience; and second, the story is read, reinterpreted, and retold by Death, a character who acknowledges his complete inability to understand the human experience. Yet, we the readers are supposed to derive deep understanding about the human experience from these two unreliable narrators.<br/><br/>The fairy-tale-like quality of the work made it difficult for me to give credence to its weighty main theme, namely: given all the pain and inhumanity inherent in the human condition, is there still sufficient value in human existence? In all likelihood, the young adult reader will come away from this book answering this question with a resounding, "Yes!" But the adult reader may want more complexity and reality from a novel dealing with such a serious theme. For the adult reader, I believe the book succeeds better with its secondary theme concerning the enormous power of words to do good and bad in the world.<br/><br/>As a young-adult novel, "The Book Thief" succeeds admirably. Its words are powerful and do good in the world.  I recommend this work and eagerly look forward to reading more books by this gifted writer.
 I wanted to know more.  I wanted to know what was in the "spaces".  The characters in this book were more than words, they were words with breath and soul and I feel as if I have parted ways with old friends now that the last page has been turned.  Thank you Markus Zusak for sharing these characters with the world.
 Second time re reading this and it's still such a amazing and life changing read. I highly reccomend it. You can check out my booktalk about it here where I give my full review~<br/><br/> ...]
 This book is about human suffering and inhumanity, set in Nazi Germany. But yet there is the goodness in people that gives us hope. And, then there are the children -- Liesel and Rudy -- fell in love with them. A childhood friendship that was an unspoken romance between two young people. Written from a unique perspective, it kept me engaged from beginning to end.
 This book touched my soul. The writing is absolutely beautiful. I personally felt like I grew up with Liesel and Rudy throughout the story. It's a shame and tragedy... Truly.. But I shall say no more!<br/>I think everyone should read this book. In the beginning I was a bit confused but the book just kept getting better and better. There's just something about the way Markus Zusak's writes that makes his characters come alive out of the pages. The characters really grow on you, Rudy, Hans, Rosa, Max, and of course, Liesel. This book is definitely one of my all time favorites.
 I took me a few pages to get acclimated to the style, but I'm glad I didn't let it stop me from reading this amazing book.  Poetic and insightful as well as a good read, damning and hopeful of the human condition at the same time. Looking forward to seeing how in the world they can translate all of that into a film - hope they do it justice.
 I think it has to be the best book I have ever read.  Well, anyway it ranks at the top, it is most definitely a must read.
 This book has an unique writing style and tells a knockout story. From a dark period in history, it's told from a different point of view. The story focuses on the experience of a young teenaged girl trying to cope with daily life, finding her place in a foster family who hides a Jew for a short time, and in the Nazi dominated culture of her town. Well worth reading, and definitely a thought provoker.
 I usually forget most books after I read them, but not this one.  The characters l and the terrible time period are so realistic that I felt that I was living through the Holocaust.  It touched me deeply and I still think about the characters and what happened to them.  Don't miss it.  Elva Delks
 Fascinating inside look at WWII from the German people's standpoint. Interesting viewpoint in the story telling. Well drawn intriguing characters. Unusual style of writing but easy to follow.
 I liked how the book described what life was like in Germany under Hutler’s reign.
 Written in an interesting point of view and told with humor and insight, I enjoyed this book very much.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in an amazing story.  I have not seen the movie but look forward to seeing this story on the big screen.
 I was hoping I would be asked to rate this book.  I would give this book more than 5 stars if I could.  It is one of the best books I've ever read.  I loved the characters and it was written from a very different and interesting perspective.  I would recommend this book to everyone.  I will probably read it again sometime.
 Really liked this book.  Excellent history of the touch times in Germany during WW2  and the deprivation the German people endured.  The courage of those who sheltered Jewish Germans is outstanding.  The book's perspective is a novel and interesting approach to writing.
 I had some trouble entering the book but eventually was drawn into the story of a foster child on Himmel Street in 1940s Germany. In just a few years she grew from frightened and illiterate to a young confident woman with a powerful love for her father, a Jew hidden in their basement, and a special friend. The narrator is Death which was a bit lofty to get used to and there's a streak of sentimentality that blurs the characters but the passion and pain of Liesel's life are palpable. And the sketched stories within the story are unique. This book is original and moving.
 The Book Thief tells an amazing story of a young girl living in Nazi Germany. Her family is hiding a Jew in their basement. The story is compelling, because it tells the story of how daily life in this era was. She is scared about the Nazis finding the man hiding in her attic, but she also just wants to have fun with friends, and maybe get her hands on some stolen fruit. I would recommend this book to anyone
 This is a book written with a very different perspective. The author's voice and word choice were definitely unique.In Germany, I'm told that this is considered a children's book and my foreign exchange student read it in school. There was a great deal of humanity and moral decision making within the context of Nazi Germany. The different vignettes told the story from a variety of perspectives. I was also intrigues to know that the author lived in Australia. This presented a different view of survival and relocation after WWII.
 Setting is WW2 Germany. Leisel is sent to live with foster parents when her young brother dies and her mom is either shipped off or just can't take care of her anymore. This is the story of her relationships and trying to live a "normal" childhood in a brutal time. Written in an entirely unique point of view.....I LOVED IT. Authentic voice and characters.
 This was an excellent book that took a little getting used to because of the narrative styling, but I am immensely glad that I continued.  The Book Thief transports and transforms, digging a tunnel directly to your heart with its main characters.  It doesn't take but a minute to become fully invested in the futures and interactions among them.  Without giving away any of the story, I will say that it is a completely satisfying read that I would encourage any reader to pick up.
 The narration by "death" is a unique approach to tell a story.  At first I was confused, but once into the book.... the author's portrayal's of the characters and descriptions of the settings were so real.  Interested in seeing the movie now that I have completed one of the interesting novels.  Very well written.
 This story is not new and the tragedy of this part of that war never changes or improves.  Death is a grand story-teller in that he has seen it all.  His compassion as he does his job overwhelms your heart.  So many characters, so many stories, each one connected yet also separate.  Great writing.  I loved it.
 Death as the narrator of this journey through the childhood of a young German girl is a startling story.  The young girl comes into a small German town and placed with a childless couple for safekeeping.  Because the story leads up to and through WWII; safekeeping is so uncertain.<br/><br/>The young girl learns the power of words for communicating, understanding and wielding power.  Words bring friendship, love and hate.  Words made her feel an outsider and then gave her family and love.<br/><br/>Death stands above and observes all.
 One of the most powerful, wonderful, yet cruel books I've ever read. Don't look for a happy ending here. Look for how the experience of this book changes your way of thinking.
 Not only is this book narrated by a very grim, insightful, and often sarcastically funny Death, but it's full of unforgetable characters you can't help but love. Liesel is an innocent German girl living through the horrors of Nazi Germany. She loses the little family she has, gets sent to live with strangers, and becomes best friends with the Jew hiding in the basement. The story is amazing from page 1!
 This may be intended for teen readers, but it is captivating for adults as well. The story is heartbreaking, but the language and imagery are truly inspired.
 Dont let the abstract introduction stop you.  This is a very human and very heart breaking story.  I laughed and cried a lot reading it.  Both happy tears and genuine grief tears.  Check out The Messenger by Zusak if you like this, its lighter hearted but a lot of fun with out the gravitas of the Book Thief.
 This book captured my interest from the first couple pages.  It described both the goodness of people and the terrible evil that can over-take even large groups.  I rejoiced with the characters in the happiness they found in small things during difficult times, and in the heartache and difficulties they endured.  I highly recommend it!
 I read this book in just a few sittings and I have recommended it to my reading friends.  The setting and the times interest me.  I am always amazed at how human beings are able to live in the midst of such horrific conditions.  It makes me grateful to live in the USA at this point in time.  Complaining about many goings on in our country ) Books such as this are a wake up call to what life could be.  When I saw the clips at the end of the book from the movie ( Hollywood sure does dress up the characters- not at all what I imagined as I read the story.
 It was a wonderfully written novel  that took us back to a very difficult time in history. And, being told through the eyes of a young girl and her life experiences in Germany renewed the historical events of this time.
 This is the best book I've ever read, to be completely honest. At the beginning of this book, I was very confused, and I wondered if I'd be able to even finish it. 10 pages later, I was hooked. The book thief is not just a story of death and of world war II, or even of the complications of hiding a Jewish man. It is a story of love and friendship, New beginnings and angst, comfort and understanding, and honesty in a way that's never been more honest. I recommend it to everybody.
 Excellent
 Liesel lives on humble Himmel Street with her foster parents, Hans and Rosa, and they hide their Jewish friend, Max, in their basement.  Liesel steals books from the mayor's mansion and plays soccer with her best friend, Rudy.  Hans, a house painter, plays accordion and teaches Liesel to read.  Rosa takes in washing and Liesel helps by doing pickups and deliveries.  As the war wears on, economic privation worsens, starving Jews are marched through the town to Dachau, Liesel's and Rudy's fathers are drafted into service, and air raids hit.  Liesel's evolving relationships with peers and adults illuminate the story.  Please read this; it's well worth it.
 The most beautiful story I have ever read.<br/>Markus Zusak uses evocative imagery built with improbable word combinations which amazingly work to put you right there with Liesel and Rudy and Max.<br/>Wonderful characters, I already miss them as part of my day.<br/>Thank you Mr. Zusak.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to people of all ages who enjoy becoming lost in another world as they read.
 Wow!  Powerhouse story!  Exceptionally well written.
 Excellent book, well written in an interesting format that keeps you riveted to the book. I enjoyed every minute of it. My book "My Only Choice, 1942-1956 Hungary" also available at amazon.com is about the experiences of a little girl with the Nazi and the Communist systems, while growing into a mother of three. If you liked "The Book Thief" you will like that too. Extreme right and extreme left are equally horrific. We must not allow any of them to take over, ever again.
 This is an emotional read. I have always heard of  WW II from the allied side. The book gives a little insight into what German non combatant citizens went through and the retributions they suffered when caught trying to help the Jewish people. The little girl has a powerful life force that gets her back up and moves her forward against overwhelming odds while she lifts the spirits of those who pass through her life.
 When I finished this book, I immediately turned back to the beginning and read it again! I just loved it and didn't want it to end. An unusual format that really works to tell an unforgettable story.
 Beautiful edition of a wonderful and captivating book that sheds light on extremely important history and issues. The characters are captivating and Zusak really insures that the reader is part of the story.
 Enjoyed the character development, but I did not like the grim reaper as the narrator. His narration was a bit stilted. The a play of opposing classes was interesting to follow. I'm glad to have read it, but it's not the best I've ever read on the topic.
 I can't say I "like" the book because the subject is not pleasing. Nor did I like having Death as the narrator, but who better to tell a sad tale about Nazi Germany and the humans who haunt him; among them, a girl that lived on the other side of the river, a Jew with feathery hair, an accordion player, and a boy with golden hair.  And the words, spoken and unspoken. Powerful
 Amazing read.  If you like historical World War II fiction, you must include this in your life-up of books!  And I have never read a book narrated by death.. what a great perspective.  You will fall in love with ALL of the characters!!!
 Incredible story, chilling at times, emotionally moving and gives whole new perspective on.......well I don't want to ruin your experience of discovery by finishing my sentence. Simply outstanding with a great narrator. Plan on listening to it again!
 This book shows the desperation of the German people as their lives are swept up in a war they didn't want, or understand.  It cleverly portrays th horrors of the war through the innocent life of a young girl and her neighbors in a small village.
 I LOVED this book, from how it was narrated to the characters and plot.  This book made me stay up late and wake up early as I could not wait to find out what was happening within its pages.  Then the tragedy is not how it ends but it comes to an end.  Wonderful reading from start to finish.
 We have all heard of the holocaust and varying opinions of whether the German people knew or didn't know of the slaughter of the Jews.  This book tells a story from the ordinary German's perspective of the horrors of WWII and horrible it was.  The repercussions suffered by the Germans for assisting the Jews would make anyone with a family think hard. This is about a promise kept despite the hardships that it entailed and the unexpected reward that comes because of it.  I could hardly put the book down.
 Haven't seen the movie, but the book was unexpected.  The perspective of the narrator adds a dimension to the story that I have not experienced before.  Besides the historical aspects of the story and what happens in the small German town where it takes place, it explores many of the effects of the Nazi rise in Germany on the characters.
 The Book Thief is such a fabulous read...don't miss it! Markus Zusak paints vivid pictures with his words and you'll find yourself rereading parts over and over wondering: "Now how did he think of that?" I had to put this book down for a day or two because I didn't want to finish it...it was like saying goodbye to an old friend. The narrator is Death...now how intriguing is that? This is the most beautifully written book that I have ever read...trust me, you will feel the same way.
 Slow to start, but my gosh, such a powerful book. This one will stay with me long after I've finished it.
 This was an excellent book and unique in having death as its narrator. The characters were well described and it wasn't always heavy despite the setting of Germany during World War 2. There were certainly depressing parts and it's always difficult being reminded of how Jews were treated during the Holocaust. I think anyone interested in that time period would appreciate reading this book. It has been compared to The Diary of Anne Frank but the latter left a more lasting impression.
 Moving, sad, hopeful, story of life during WW II.  Cuts to the quick with its discriptions of life in an invaded country.  Shows the great resiliance  and goodness of people.  Could happen anywhere, even here.  How would you hold up under these conditions?
 Story about a communist orphan who is placed in a lower class German home and learns to read from her foster father.  Tale carries through the war and is told from the prospective of Death.  I could not put it down and still think about how powerful it was.
 I was fascinated in the beginning, but then felt let down as the book went on. The POV of the grim reaper kept me interested though. This is one of those reads that's very subjective; it's unique and often brilliant, but often uninteresting (to me) you just need to check it out for yourself.
 I cared so much about the characters in this book. If you read and liked the book  "The Nightingale", you'll like this book.
 My daughter convinced me to read this book, as it is her favorite.  I started out mostly just because I agreed to read it.  However, it has become one of my favorites as well.  It is not often that an author brings such deep character development without sacrificing the story telling.  I found myself identifying with many of the characters.  This is a deep look into life in Germany during WWII for many.  I highly recommend this book.
 this book will be a favorite of mine, the other To Kill A mockingbird touched my soul concering mans inhumanity towards other men.  This book was spine chilling, giving me insight into the plight of men, good and evil, love unconditional, and mAde me feel Leisels pain, down to the bones!!  Bravo!!!  I loved it!!!!
 A simple concept, really.  What better narrator then death itself to tell us a story about the Holocaust?  I have honestly never for a moment considered the lives of Germans, especially German children, who also were the victims of the Furher. I will treasure this story for the great lessons it has taught me.
 Good book
 I absolutely love this book.  It could have been a tear jerker but it was handled in such away that you were prepped for it.  Sad but still it will be one of my favorite books.  I am thinking of buying it so I can have it on my shelve
 Love! This book has an interesting perspective, fabulous imagery, and a hearty subject matter. I will be teaching this novel to my sophomore class and can't wait to get their opinions on it. Heavy subject matter so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone in middle school quite yet.
 I enjoyed this book as the style of writing was very different from most.  It also gripped my attention because when I typically read books pertaining to WWII, they are from perspectives other than German. It was interesting reading about the life of a German girl during Hitler's reign and terror.  A good book, deep at times and light at others.
 Beautiful and desperate at the same time. The author's style draws you into the book's world and doesn't release you until the end.
 Irresistibly pangful. The narrator's perspective brings a childlike clarity that kept me playfully engaged. Set in the horrific backdrop of the holocaust, I found myself groping for some semblance of a happy ending. Vivid characters. Good read!
 I read this book a couple of years ago at my daughter's recommendation; I'm reading it again for a book club.  The author paints (and I don't use that word lightly) a dismal, but likely true, picture of life in Germany during WWII.  The narrator is 'Death,' but the descriptive and enjoyable writing is anything but doleful.  It is the poignant story of a foster child, who experiences the death of her brother as the book begins and she is on her way to her new foster home.  The character development of all in the book is captivating, and it is hard to put this (long) book down.  It didn't hurt one bit to see the movie before reading it the second time.  And only seeing the movie would mean missing so much.
 This book jolts the reader with an unusual narrator whose view of humankind puts life and death into an ever expanding arena. The Central characters' lives provide a window into the human soul that must exist and stay true even when the world has ceased to make sense.  Good descriptive passages, beautiful use of language to evoke the time and place.  Would recommend this book enthusiastically. It stays with you.
 Normally I do not read books like this. I am into scifi and horror. In its own way this book is indeed a horror book. This book although fiction really paints a true picture of nazi Germany. It's a real page turner. It's a heart breaker but it is also heart warming. I just loved this book and I am so glad I took a chance on it. I wanted to read it before I saw the movie but I am pretty confident that the book will blow the movie away.
 There are lots of war movies, movies that show battles and man's inhumanity to man. Hitler was a demon who terrorized the world. This book covered only a tiny part of that. It was like looking into the window of a small, very poor village in Germany during this period of history.  It portrayed the innocence of the children, the fears of the parents, and the ethical dilemma of being forced to betray people that they had grown to love and respect. Narrated by "death" itself,  the reader interacts with the family and grows to care for them. It's a real story, not a sensational drama, introducing the history of the time from a different perspective.
 Found hardcover.
 To say that this book is a breeze to read would be a lie. The writing style is quite easy to read. It's the emotional impact of those simple sentences that are hardest part.<br/><br/>I've read so many sad, bittersweet books that I cannot begin to count. But, this one.... oh, how lovely the pain is expressed. I sobbed like a baby.
 The book came on time. It is in GREAT condition. My daughter said all she can say is... Amazing. Thank you.
 Truly a remarkable work, the synopsis does not give the interwoven characters and relationships justice.  Yes, the family hides a Jewish man in their basement, but this book is so much more than that.  This is a book written for those that love to read.  Read it and find out what makes death afraid.
 I have red this book twice now and I loved it both times. It is an essential read for anyone who thinks they know all about WWII and the Holocaust. I found the story written from a different perspective than normal to be interesting and it sheds a slightly different light on a terrible time in history.
 I love to read stories from past lives.  The Book Thief was a glimpse of what life was like in Germany during WWII, for the residence in a small village.  Told though the eyes of a soul taker, following the life of a young girl, it kept me interested and wanting to finish the book quickly.
 one of the best books I have ever read-looking from the German family viewpoint this book gives great insight on what is was like to  a German in Germany during World Was 11
 This is my new favourite fiction book. It is set during the holocaust. As expected, there are times of sadness, but it is not always sad. Death personified is narrating the story. It contains some of the best characterization I have ever read.
 Death is the narrator so at times it is a little confusing.  However it is a great story told from a different side than we are used to hearing from.
 I really loved this book. It is well written, has a great heroine and the historical background is well depicted. A fresh perspective on an awful tragedy. There are always so many small stories with in the bigger one. This is a book for anyone whether read for reading enjoyment or for its literary value.
 It took me a little while to understand just who was telling the story.<br/>But I found the book worth reading.
 This book pulls you into the character's lives...you feel their emotions...experience the joys and sorrows of such a sad period in our world's history.  The author has the gift of making you feel that you are right there, deeply entangled in their lives and times.  I truly enjoyed the reading as well as the different perspectives given.
 By far my favorite book! The language is beautiful and imaginative, and you can't help but fall in love with the characters. A rare treat that will undoubtedly bring you to tears.
 Excellent story of WWII Germany seen through the eyes of a child - the 'Book Thief' - who matures, suffers many losses and deprivations, but maintains humanity. Beautifully written.
 Similar to the Anne Frank story but from the German perspective of a German orphan. Told from a novel fictionalized narration of death as a character and the narrator in 1939 Germany and the war years. A morbid subject in a terrible period of world history, but told as a morality tale filled with both tragedy and inspirational perseverance from a unique perspective.
 My teenage son has been trying to get me to read this book for months. He loved it. I finally had a chance and I have to agree with him. This book is a great read for teens to learn more about the struggles of Jews during WW2. As well as the Germans who didnt support the Nazi party.
 A tale of a German girl who survives the Holocaust. Narrated by death. He revels in the sublime beauty and horror that is the human condition, and is haunted by humans that he feels he is continuously overestimating or underestimating. But if it is possible for death to love a human, death lives Leisel Meminger, the book thief whose life is shaped by words...
 I quite enjoyed The Book Thief. I took a little while to get used to the style, but soon I was hooked. I loved the character development. I grew to enjoy the style and looked forward to each new chapter. I found it very original and captivating. The story evoked wartime Germany in a different way than I've ever seen before. The scenes were funny, intriguing and heartbreakng.<br/>Great book!
 Due to the style of narration, and finally figuring out WHY the narrator was Death, I was able to understand the plot a bit better...have to be honest, I was about 60% into the book, almost gave up on this book, but stuck with it... Last few sections were worth it. This book was a struggle, but it finally made sense.... Sad, but true to history and from a viewpoint you rarely hear from. Glad I made it to the end...
 Markus Zusak is an incredible writer. Although a bit wordy at first the reading is amazing, draws you in and he gives us so many gems on so many pages. I thoroughly enjoy his twist on words...so original. Excellent! Makes me want to read everything he has written. Thank you MZusak for sharing your writing gift. Maggie B
 This book is extremely interesting.  First of all, it is narrated by "Death", which ia a bit disconcerting in the beginning.  As one progresses through the novel, the interactions between the young German girl, her foster parents, and the Jewish man they attempt to hide from the Nazis is very poignant and touching.  The novel is written in a unique style and was a very enjoyable read.
 Markus Zusak is a great author.  "The Book Thief" is the fourth of his books that I have read, and each one of them was compelling reading in its own way.  "The Book Thief" is his most ambitious undertaking of the four, and it is a fascinating read.  His books may be targeted at young adult readers, but I am in my 60s, and it has been great for me.
 I actually had low expectations for this book, despite its reviews. This is just not normally the type of book I'd read. However, I picked it up anyway and I'm glad I did! The story was fantastic and you know when you've read a great book when you are truly sad when you finish it. I know I was.
 The writers style was easy to read and held my attention, but the section (chapter) breaks seemed to take away from the momentum of the story.<br/><br/>I loved the description of humanity from so many different perspectives. It also helped to see how we as a society can be led astray by our leaders and peer pressure if we are willing to follow.<br/><br/>I am still deciding if I liked the story being "narrated" by death.<br/><br/>Overall, a good story well worth your time and reflection.
 bought it for a class, was a good book
 This story is a creatively crafted narrative that is gripping in the simple beauty of the emotions it triggers in the middle of such horror. I wasn't expecting to like a book about nazi Germany's and was very surprised to be reading from the perspectives of a non-Jewish narrator-,well I guess technically the narrator isn't anything. It brought me emotional insight into the experiences of ww2 that other " classics" have not.<br/>Highly recommend the book to anyone who enjoys some non conventional narrative perspectives and layout  with good characters and plot.
 I found this book a struggle for the writing style but by the middle of the book was totally hooked.  It was a whole different story on Germany and the persecutions, even tho not Jewish, during the time of Hitler.  I feel this book is  one that will be read and reviewed by many book clubs and high school literature classes.
 I was planning on reading this book anyway... eventually (I was in no rush). But a friend of mine was raving about how great the movie was. Whenever a book is based on a movie, I prefer to read the book first before watching the movie, so after hearing her sing this praises about the movie, I got cracking on the book. I am glad I did or I would still be putting off reading it and would be missing out on this great story. I love this book from begining to end. It is heart breaking!! So full of significance and human emotion. Now I'm ready to watch the movie.
 The author has such a unique style of storytelling. I couldn't put it down and will recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good read.
 Fantastically and unusually written novel!  Interwoven story is just beautiful while also being sad.  The overall theme seems to be the freedom we have in small decisions rather than having to follow the crowd.  SO highly recommended!!!!!!!!  Liked the movie, too, but I'm so glad I read the book first!
 This is a very enlightening view into Nazi Germany that I had not read about before.  The perspective of lost and lonely child and how she blossoms in some of the worst conditions in history.  It's a testament to the human spirit and people can make a difference even when there is little hope.
 The Book Thief was well written and an engrossing story. I was disappointed when I finished the book as I didn't want it to end - some stories are like that! I would have liked to learn a little more of Liesel's life after the war. If you've seen the movie you will thoroughly enjoy the book. Good read!
 This was a pretty good read.  It became a bit tedious and lengthy at times, but I enjoyed the unique perspective and the focus on color.  A worthwhile read for adults.
 I am, of course, premature in writing this review, since I am only about 100 pages into my first reading of the paperback text.  But already there is no question in my mind that the book deserves all the accolades it has already received since its first publication some years ago.  My only excuse -- if it is that -- is that I just came to the book very recently (and, I'd like to say for the record, atone initiated a book discussion forum by the title of "The Book Thieves"  ahem..] before going to the Amazon entry for *The Book Thief* and finding out I'd been beaten to the punch a considerable time ago, oh well.)  Among other things -- but i'm sure this has already also been noted ahead of me) -- there is a sardonic Death in charge throughout Ingmar Bregman's  game-changing movie, "The Seventh Seal," one helluvah way to be introduced to Chaucer's "Knights' Tale" as a wet-behind-the-ears, just-off-the-boat Harvard junior English major, Fall of 1960.  Brrrr.<br/><br/>The writing here is superb, the pace is spell-binding, and the cliff-hanging suspense at the ends of chapters is, well,  suspenseful -- sorry -- and I know I'm far behind the rest of you.  I *think* we're going to abandon our own free-standing discussion forum, and I'll send a note to that effect to my co-conspirator in that baby beginning.  Thank you, Amazon, for putting all these resources at the tip of one's computer. "Oh Death was never enemy of ours/  We laughed with him, we leagued with him, old chum... .Knowing that better men would come, and greater wars,/<br/> When each proud fighter brags he wars on Death for Life. / Not men, for flags." (Wilfred Owen).
 No way is this merely Young Adult fiction  ...  in fact, our book club had the best discussion ever.  One becomes fascinated by the characters and comes to appreciate Death. The author says so much in a mere three or four words ...  descriptions and use of colors need to be spoken aloud. The plot is mentioned in other reviews so I only will say it is simple, yet complex.  Stories within the story touch the soul, and The Book Thief is now one of my favorite novels ever.
 I liked this book because it is written in a different format than most books.  The narration is captivating.  The author uses all your senses to help you experience this profound story.  The characters are believable and very well developed.  I loved this book, eventhough the story was of a very dark and sad time in our history.  The author did an excellent way of telling this story in a way that kept me reading into the night.<br/><br/>The unusual thing about this book that sets it apart from others, is the point of view the author chose to use.  Another great aspect is that one of the side characters, Papa, turns out to be quite a hero.  Thanks for not making him a villian. It was a wonderful touch to make the man be the tender and compassionate parent. I think this is a brilliantly written book. It is marketed to young adults, but certainly is very well written for anyone.  I have recommended this book to several other family members.
 I enjoyed is book immensely.  It starts out a little slowly, but once into it, it is a page turner.  The story is beautiful yet haunting.
 The lack of proper past tense gets annoying, otherwise it's fine
 The Book Thief's beauty is in its simplicity. The book is narrated by Death, and he tells us the story of  Leisel  Meminger a young German girl who at onset of World War II, has already endured some very difficult personal trials. Through The Grim Reaper's narration we follow Leisel's new life on Himmel (German for heaven) Street in the fictional town of Molching. We meet a cast of characters meant to show us what life was like for the average German citizen as the Nazi party hurled the world into war.<br/><br/>The book gets its title from Liesel's taking a book dropped on the ground during a very traumatic moment in her early life. This book is used by her step-father to teach Leisel to read and write.  Through these teaching sessions, she develops a strong bond with her step-father, and a love for words and reading and writing and of course, books. Throughout the novel Leisel does what she can to procure new books and she uses them to enrich her life and the lives of her friends and neighbors.  The most poignant moments come as Leisel and a houseguest, Max, share their love of reading together, and He creates some books for her.  This "guest" is a young Jewish man whom the family takes in and hides at great risk to their own safety.<br/><br/>Through Leisel and her small world we see the Nazi party gain a foothold with nearly every citizen in town. We learn that there are real and personal costs to individuals who disagree with the party.  We see what it was like to live with rationing. We watch as a populace does nothing and often even joins in on the harassment of the Jews in their town. Soon they are all gone and we are taught the price that individuals might pay to help a Jewish friend with the Nazi machine at full power.<br/><br/>I say that the beauty of this novel is its simplicity because so many of the insights are delivered through the stories of children and their daily lives. It was somewhat reminiscent of Huck Finn in that regard.  Death communicates in simple, short sentences, and the writing is beautifully to the point; poetic.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is a novel that manages to be beautiful despite its subject matter. It is a novel that you will feel more than you will read.
 Haunting. At first I thought it would be too wordy. But the author weaves an unforgettable tale. High schoolers, and ever all Americans should read the scenes of how good people sing and chant the praises of Hitler. Regular folk succumbed. We need never to repeat the same mistake.
 This is one of those books that will stay with you as long as you live .. in a good way.  It was touching, sad, heart-breaking, joyous, and thought provoking.  The book is much, much better than the movie.  You won't be sorry you read this one.
 I love this book. It is written from a different perspective which makes it very interesting. The character development is wonderful. I laughed and cried a lot while reading this beautifully tragic story from the time of WWII. Beautifully written. I would recommend it to anyone (and have!) Make sure you have tissues ready when you read this beauty!
 One of my favorite stories.  It was narrated by death, which was an interesting take on things.  It was well written.  Not graphic but it did not sugar coat the plight of the Jews or the Germans in WW II
 This is more than a story about World War II and all the horror, it is a tale about life, love, and living. The simplistic parts of every day living are detailed in such a way to make life elegant.<br/><br/>When the heroine discovers the power that made Hitler who he was, I surprising agreed.<br/><br/>This book is a different look at World War II. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
 We have all read about the disasters of WWII with the Jews and our Military but never from the point of a German citizen. I loved it.<br/> I don't think there was a person left untouched from WWII. No one got through it with out some damage, mentally or physically.
 I loved the book and the characters. It gives a touching, realistic view of life during the Nazi regime and how it effected the normal people who lived in Germany. I learned a lot while enjoying the well-written story.
 The Book Thief (TBT) is a haunting story of life in the amoral, wanton Germany that emerged during the WWII years, 1939-1943, all as seen through the eyes of children and by one dubbed “the Book Thief” by her friends: Liesel Meminger (an adopted waif, who lost her parents and only sibling early in the War); the tale encompasses her ninth through fourteenth years.  The narrator, whose prose is rudimentary at best, is an unidentified observer, seeming at times to be Death itself, but the story captivates nonetheless.  The Kindle eBook is made even more entertaining by links to short but tender videos (excerpts from the movie) that are appended to the eBook.<br/><br/>The story itself has charm and warmth, as it reveals the way remote-area, poor and semi-poor, small-town Germans coped with Hitler and WWII.  The veiled hatred of Hitler becomes widespread and is exacerbated by the growing privation and apodictic starvation that gradually become commonplace, requiring Liesel and her peers to forage the land, stealing the necessities of life.  Among the saddest scenes are those depicting the skeletal, inhumanly abused Jews, as they were marched through Molching, on their way to furnaces of Dachau.<br/><br/>The prose style is unique.  An outline form is often used, with bullet points; the vocabulary remains at early-teen level.  Since so much of the story revolves around a child’s view of events, TBT seems best suited to an early teens-audience, and, perhaps, makes a reasonably gentle introduction to life in Hitler’s Germany.<br/><br/>TBT serves as yet another reminder of the cruelty that dominated much of Europe during Hitler’s reign of terror, which began, oddly enough, in 1932, when he received 90% of the German vote.  All of Germany felt the pains of the reparations imposed by the Versailles Treaty, which followed WWI, and the populace was searching for a way to reject it.  Once in power, very subtly, Hitler became a demagogue and, then, absolute dictator, by 1938 or so, when he began WWII by reclaiming Austria as part of Germany.<br/><br/>It is interesting, albeit tragic, to read of life in small-town Germany, 1939-1943, but is this book worth the candle one must burn to read it in the dark of night?  For those who yearn to be supplanted from their current homes into small-town Germany during WWII, yes, by all means; it is worth the time and effort.  For those who have experienced enough revisiting of WWII, and who do not enjoy simplistic prose, ignored and emasculated grammar, perhaps not.  Since its dialogue stems from its barely literate characters and/or is so pre-teen bent, and since the grisly horrors of Hitler are not really detailed, TBT may be best suited for young readers, those in their early to mid-teens.<br/><br/>The real author, Markus Zusak, is Australian, born in 1975, a sometimes English teacher, and the author of The Messenger, which has also become an international best seller, and several other books.  His mother, Lisa (a sound-alike to Liesel), was born in Germany, likely in or near Hitler’s reign, and, by personal experience or contact with other Germans, seems a probable source for Zusak’s knowledge of Germany under Hitler.<br/><br/>2 Stars for Adults;  4 Stars for Children<br/>BookAWeekMan  ( ...])
 What could have been a truly unique perspective of the WWII experience -- at least for a non-European -- was a bit too much of a sampler as the author tries to show the effects on a variety of people.  Some of the circumstances seemed a bit contrived; some of the introduced characters and situations were never developed. Yes, in some respects the book left me wanting more, but in this case it wasn't the hallmark of an exceptional novel.  Would I recommend other read it?  Probably.
 I felt this book was very repetitious. I actually never finished it. The part about her stealing books made no sense to me because it was a thread running through the book with no logical purpose. This left the entire thrust of the book as a simple tale of the pranks and daily happenings of childhood friendships.
 There was no limit to human cruelty, as this book so profoundly reveals in this sad story. In our history the unthinkable happened to our fellow man, and also to an innocent little girl that steals your heart for her intelligence and strength to endure.<br/>This is one of the best books I've ever read.
 Well written, imaginative. Best novel I read this year.
 My husband read this with out 14 year old daughter and really enjoyed the story and the authors unique voice for the narrator.
 I was determined to read and finish this book.  The narrator was death and sometimes it was hard to follow.  Overall, I enjoyed the book and the history.  I think it’s a book everyone should read in their lifetime.
 This is a long story, heart wrenching. There were a few small things I did not understand, but will figure those out when I read it again. If YOU are reading this for the first time, do not give up. Things will become clearer later on. It is a wonderful book, whether you are interested in WWII or not.
 It was a little different twist on the sad story of those years:  a more sympathetic telling of the situation good hearted, regular German citizens found themselves in.  It has a sad ending of course but surely is an awfully well told story with a "there but for the grace of God" moral throughout.
 The story line had me from the very beginning of the book.  I cried and laughed...mostly cried with the main character.  Such heroism in her foster parents.  The story really makes one appreciate what we have now and how so many people in Nazi Germany suffered along with the Jewish population.
 Wonderful book bringing us back to when hitler was in charge and what this child went through having to get used to a new family, new town, new school, new friends, the war, hiding a Jewish man ect. I really enjoyed it and surprisingly is narrated by death!
 This isn't your typical Nazi Germany story.  It is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read, and it's astounding that its beauty is so powerful considering the fact that it takes place during one of the ugliest chapters of mankind.  Riveting, touching, heartwarming, heartbreaking and inspiring all at once.
 Well written.  You can't help but pull for the Book Thief and hope she gets a break in life.  I like that it is narrated by the grim reaper and gives you a different perspective on that character.  Not so fearsome.  I really enjoyed this book.  Now I can watch the movie.
 It is a rare book that can break my heart &amp; reduce me to tears, but this is one such book. Set in WWII Germany through the eyes of a young german girl w/ Death as the narrator, it shows her foster family and friends' struggle to survive while trying to do the right thing down to the Jewish man hidden in the basement. The book has an important underlining theme of how words, written or otherwise, can make such an impact on lives and to choose them wisely.  Makes for a great book club read as it will spark heated conversations, opinions about war, and how many of the issues of that era can relate to today's issues.  Clearly written for a young adult audience, but still captivating for the adult reader.
 The author used a very unique style for writing this book. It was difficult to get used to at first but I decided to stick it out and in the end, I was pleasantly surprised that it all made sense. The Book Thief is a remarkable story, handcrafted from a tough period in time, so get your tissues ready and enjoy!
 The Book Thief is a young girl who could be paralysed by suffering. The novel presents the ways in which various people express love and provide care for her as she grows and matures. Different perspectives on the backdrop of WWII Germany are provided through the eyes of the main characters, and the interludes provided by Death as the narrator weave together a memorable tale. The reader is informed about the period in a persuasive multi-faceted way. I have gone back to read it again a number of times. The story intrigues me and provides evidence for the triumph of loving relationships in the most demanding of circumstances.
 Uniquely structured and narrated by Death...I couldn't help wondering how this book could be translated into a movie and retain it's beauty. While I could have viewed the clips in this enhanced edition, I avoided them, holding on to the book's own rhythm and essence. Words escape me... truly everyone should read this book.
 I am a sixty year old who seldom reads fiction but I loved this book. I loved what it told about being human, and that the narrator was Death, that which we seldom want to consider. I think anyone from age fourteen onward could relate to this book on some level.
 I bought this book for my grandchild on the recommendation of another grandchild.<br/>Now his parent's want one for themselves.<br/>The actual physical quality of the book makes it a keepsake.<br/>I haven't read it but I am assured by my other grandchildren that it is very good.
 I couldn't put this book down! It takes awhile to get used to the narrative but then it's very interesting.<br/>I only gave 3 stars because I was disappointed in the ending but won't give that away here. With such a good story I expected an epic ending. I still recommend though.
 I searched for books set in the Munich Germany area because I was going there on vacation and this book was suggested.  I had a hard time getting into it, but I was motivated to finish it.  I'm glad I did.  While in Munich we spent a day at Dachau, and I could visualize Max and the other prisoners walking to the camp.
 I loved the structure of this book.  It contributed greatly to the story.  I fell in love with all of the characters, good and not so good people.  And unlike some books, I felt completed by the ending.  Markus Zusak is now on my list of best authors.
 This was a very good book. I did have a hard time at the beginning but as I went along I couldn't put it down. The fact that the narrator was death took a bit to understand what an important part he w in the story.<br/>I loved the relationships that were played out in the story'. The author did a superb job if describing each one. Diesel was such a strong young lady.<br/>I have recommended it to so many people!
 This sad but fascinating story is a book that I had to keep reading in spite some very sad parts.  I found it gave me a very different view of WWII than I got from other stories.  Well worth reading.
 My 8th grade son and daughter recommended this book to me in the Fall 2013. I had a hard time putting it down. I really enjoy the perspective of the narrator, whose identity I won't give away here. Suffice to say, it's very clever! You'll run through every emotion while reading this book. Happy, sad, angry, frustrated...because the author knows how to bring the reader into the story.
 This story has my heart so twisted and knotted up, it's going to take time to recover. And yet I'm not sure that I want to ever leave this world of words, one with so little left to offer but for the salvation that hope can bring. The daring, compassionate, mischievous and profound Liesel Memminger won't exist in any other book, and I will truly miss her in my daily reading life. But she and her beloved family and friends will never leave my heart.
 What an amazing story! I loved every second of this book! It was just so good!!! There are just not enough words to describe how it touched me. It is SO well written, the characters are so wonderful. please read this book,  you will not be sorry!!!
 Excellent book from a German village girls point of view in WWII who's caretakers were Jew sympathyzers and helped hide them. She preserved her humanity and self with her deep character, intelligence and the "books". Wonderful book!
 I have this book five stars because it was a wonderful way to think of the citizens of Germany during Hitler's rule. I didn't agree with all of them, but the main family I could identify with emotionally. This book made me laugh, cry, happy, hopeful, angry at some and also more respectful for those who lived through this war. I loved that I was able to experience all these emotions along with the book thief.
 Could not put this book down, it is a must read. The story takes you inside Hitler's Germany during the late 30's and early 40's.<br/>You really get a feel for the life this little girl led, her foster family, and the friendships she made and the books she stole in order<br/>grow her education. Zusak definitely has a way with telling the story through the third person of the "angel of death."<br/>I highly remommend this book.
 Thank you- as advertised...
 I found this book to be very depressing. I had trouble reading it and yet I had trouble putting it down. It made a profound impact on me. It was an eye-opener about a young German girl's life during Nazi Germany. A beautiful, but very sad story.
 This story illustrates the tragic experiences of some of the (poorer) Jews who lived in Germany in the late '30's and early 40's.  It also helps us to understand that there were compassionate German people who helped save some of those Jews, at great risk and sacrifice to their own daily existence.<br/><br/>Liesel's love for books, education, AND the value of family/friend loyalty is a beautiful example of human possibility under the most<br/>extreme and threatening conditions of an orphan's life.<br/><br/>The book describes this historical time with extraordinary clarity and truth.  Much better told than the movie.  I hope it touches  and<br/>softens the hearts of those who read the story.
 Since I have a passion for reading, the title of this book intrigued me.  What I discovered was a unique and beautifully crafted story of ordinary people whose lives become forever altered by the ugliness Hitler's Nazi Germany.  The perfect sensitivity with which the author treats his characters envelops the reader in the warmth and love he feels for them and the plight of people who have no official power over their own lives but nonetheless have the strength of human spirit and the comfort of their fragile human bonds.
 no one mentions the writing style of this book... unique, and for me difficult to really enjoy
 Beautifully written- mesmerizing and unique - this story is not to be missed a must read! This book quickly climbed my top favorite books of all times. It is a deeply moving, realistic human  microscope on all the beauty, the horror, the sorrow - all woven together with a clever, witty, and unapologetic narrator.
 I began reading this book under the impression that it was written for teen readers. That was proven quickly to be erroneous. It should definitely be read by adults as well. At times, I had to remind myself that Death not Leisel was the narrator. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a unique approach to a worthwhile story.
 Loved both.  I actually saw the movie first and then bought the book.  They are both wonderful.  The author's decision for the narrator was a very interesting choice, the story was great and his writing exceptional. The casting in the movie was perfect and made the book come even more alive after seeing the movie.  Highly recommend both.
 Loved the story, the characters and the narration which made the story surreal.  Very, very sad but at the same time great to read about war heros, even if they were fictional.  This book really touched me deep inside.  I just finished "Once We Were Brothers" and they both were great books.
 NEVER READ A MARKUS ZUSAK, BUT SUGGESTED BY MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW WHO IS WORKING ON HER MEDICAL DEGREE.  JUST AS SHE STATED, IT IS A GREAT READ AND STORY.  LOVED THE FACT THAT THE STORY IS INTENSE ENOUGH TO KEEP MY INTEREST WITH DETAILS, BUT NO GORE.  HAVING LIVED IN GERMANY AS AN ARMY BRAT, I AM ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE ATROCITIES DURING THE TIME PERIOD OF THE STORY, DON'T NEED THEM REHASHED.
 I absolutely loved this book.  While it was slow, it kept your interest completely.  You got to know the characters and either loved or hated them.  I even felt sympathy for the people of Germany because they lived in fear of Hitler and the SS, as well as the fear the Jewish people or those who were different felt.  I would highly recommend this book for a book club choice.
 Arrived in excellent condition.
 I absolutely loved this book a and the unique and interesting way it was written.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
 Cannot write a review that even remotely can describe this book-<br/>It is one of those books that you will stay up all night to finish-<br/>I loved how it was narrated- it was well written-<br/>I feel so any of my reviews are 1 to 2 stars, however this one should be a 10..<br/>PS. still have not watched the movie because I loved the book so much
 One of the best books I have ever read!
 I'm never sure how I will like books or movies about this horrific time in history...this is a good one.  Loved the narrator, the character development, the relationships, the love...all in a time of deep horror and sorrow and people trying to live and not just live but survive.  The movie came out but I knew I had to read this first.  You won't be disappointed.
 Today, Sunday the 10th July, around 1:55 AM, I had finished the most beautiful book I've ever read. A book, though breathtakingly beautiful, it showed mankind at its worst and its best. How? I have no words that could tell you. Maybe the words were there, but they weren't enough, no amount of them could ever be.<br/><br/>I couldn't find one word that could that could describe the way this book made me feel as I burned through its pages full of life and death and as I read every single word it held so dearly.<br/><br/>Words, words, words. It was also the story of Liesel's love affair with words and yet the words themselves could not do her story any justice. I'm sure, sure as Death, sure that even from the moment I read the first words that I was then a lifelong fan of Marcus Zusak. Making Death the narrator was truly original, very unusual indeed. He gave Death a personality, a personality that was interesting and that had drawn my attention and approval from the very start. Deaths was kind, had a sense of humour and believe it or not, he had a heart.<br/><br/>Now I attempt to share and describe my thoughts and my feelings. It was like riding some sort of emotional rollercoaster that had begun slowly and gradually gained momentum. Happiness had been constant after the cloudy days, but that didn't mean that sadness and despair wouldn't catch up. They did. Oh, yes they certainly did.<br/><br/>The ride had been bumpy here and smooth there. I was drawn to Liesel, to her innocence, the way see saw the world and the monsters in it through her observant childish eyes. Her world was a dark one but now there was her new Papa and Mama, Hans and Rosa Hubberman, and not forgetting our lemon headed friend, Rudy Steiner. They shone through her gloomy days of black, lonely cloud filled sky like bright stars of hope.<br/><br/>Then there came the books, how could I forget the books. Liesel and her beloved books. And Frau Herman who gave some. She had stolen one even before she could have even read, but Hans, her Papa, her gentle Papa taught her how to speak their language, how to use them, to befriend them and in return the words had comforted her and accepted her as a dear lifelong friend.<br/><br/>Her not-so-gentle Mama was there helping Liesel along in her own special way. Oh and Rudy! Oh, boy, Rudy! I loved him. I loved him for being him. I loved him for his will and character. I loved him for being a fighter, for not giving up. For his spunk and his pranks. Most of all, I loved him for just being there, his existence alone brings a smile to my lips, salty with tears, and for being there for the book thief.<br/><br/>Then there came Max. Max who, in my opinion, had a great impact on Liesel's life. They both had much in common. A filthy Jew was how many saw him and his kind, but oh, I hope to God that he didn't think of himself that way because I know and so did Death that Max was nothing of the such, well not filthy, figuratively that is. He was scared and scarred, guilt ridden and was hopeless. But he was kind, thoughtful and creative. He saw a ray of hope in the book thief. He had lost so much and was full of memories of his family. But he had the Hubberman's to whom he was extremely grateful for they had put their necks in the line of fire for his, and he also had Liesel who made his days bearable.<br/><br/>This was some ride. Hans was like a father to the girl and considered her his own; he was her Papa after all. The way Liesel would describe him and his accordion and his mannerisms I could clearly see him before me with his silver eyes and gentle loving face. At times I felt that he was my papa too. Hans Hubberman was a strong and honest man.<br/>Liesel was right when she said to herself that this ugly world didn't deserve Max and Mr. Steiner, nor did it deserve the likes of her Papa and Rudy.<br/><br/>I want to lighten the gloomy atmosphere; it doesn't do me any good at all.<br/><br/>I enjoyed peeking into their childhood days; Liesel's and Rudy's. Rudy the saukrel who had always longed for the kiss of a certain sticky handed book thief. The best friends stole together, laughed, played and grieved together, but alas... oh, here I go again all gloomy and I nearly spoiled a bit over there too.<br/><br/>How they ate their looted fruit, oh and how it came out again, but Liesel had gotten off the hook that time; her sharp Papa blamed the soup! And Rudy's little war with that Hitler Youth fanatic, Deutscher. And that Jesse Owens incident!<br/><br/>The two of them had guts all right, and that was evident from their other stunt with the Jews and the bread. I must cut this short because I could go on forever. It's now 3:05 AM and I'm gonna get a hiding myself.<br/><br/>Marcus Zusak is an artist, like Death with his colours, who knows how to paint not only with his variety of shades but with their unforgettable words. Words that will remain with me forever. As long as I live.<br/><br/>I have to admit that the bits of profanity, "Jesus, Mary and Joseph" and "crucified Christ" had me chuckling.<br/>I've learnt that war is an evil that masquerades as a necessity for defence and , ironically, for peace. Though The Book Thief may seem just another book, it's not. It was a reality for the countless Liesels, Maxes, Rudys, Mamas' and Papas' back then. A reality for Jews and the Germans and people all over the world. And it still is a reality. People are still living and going through what Liesel had. Yes, today, as I write this review. Today as you read it. War.<br/><br/>The Fuhrer has made himself an enemy of me. Dead or alive, it's the plain damn truth. The war was stupid and senseless , precious lives were lost for nothing at all but for a crazy man's stupid belief, his prejudice and arrogance.<br/><br/>I must now conclude that the end of that rollercoaster ride was rough, rough I tell you. Bumpy beyond belief. Sharp turns, sudden breaks. So high and so steep was that fall, I nearly hurled off of my seat.<br/>I cried.<br/><br/>Oh, God, I cried on this early Sunday morning as I sat on the washing machine in the laundry room when I had finished Death's last words:<br/>"I am haunted by humans."<br/>Oh, Christ, oh Crucified Christ! I can relate.<br/><br/>(My review from Goodreads.com)
 Lyrical and haunting story. Incredible characters. Some authors write many paragraphs to convey an idea, describe a feeling. This author uses a few deftly chosen words that will touch your heart and leave a lasting impression.
 I have never left a review before - even though I read countless books and enjoy the majority of them. I feel compelled to leave a review now........  I am mithering so many people,  asking if they have read it and telling them they really must,  if they haven't already.  It is the most beautifully written story...so hard to endure sometimes....  I need to get a hard back copy ...as I read it on Kindle... the wonderfully simple, evocative drawings and the fact that I had to keep re-reading parts because the words/ scenes took your breath away mean I need a paper copy so I can handle it and just hold it. It will stay with me forever.  Thank you Markus Zusak.
 At first I thought the narrator in the story (death) was just getting in the way of the the story. But in the end he made the the story crystal clear.<br/>This is a great book though interesting even though at times they seem boring but later your reaction is like " oh now I get it"<br/>I enjoy story's like that and this is once again a very intriguing story. I hope the book thief  will steal your time (in a good way) 😊
 This is the large-print edition. I got it for my mom and she loved it. She said it was so nice to read! And she loved the story, of course.
 This is such an unusual view of WW ll.<br/>A beautiful, powerful story, full of passion, empathy and insight.<br/>I highly recommend it.
 This book is an interesting read from an historical point of view, but it tells the story in a very human way.  How would you react to some of these events???  What if you were brutally punished for doing a small humane act??  This book hooks you in the beginning and just will not let go of your heart, or your mind.  You absolutely must find out what happens in the end!
 I spent so many late nights reading this book and absorbing myself in the way the author depicted the characters. It is about a sad love story, the kindness and bitterness of human race and the ability to rise when you don't think can.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this book because it is a beautiful story and because of the author's writing style. Although English is not my first language, I enjoyed learning a few new words throughout the book.<br/>Buy this book and be ready to cry, smile, and be upset.
 It took me longer than most books ever do; not sure why. I'll always remember it. Differently written, warnings given; softened the blow. Recommended especially to those who need simply to learn the gifts that are life, love and friendship; and the pains that are cruelty and prejudice. Five stars for its simplicity and depth; and its words.
 I am so impressed with the book that I would like to see the movie. However, I have heard the movie isn't as good as the book. I will re-read this book as each character was "fleshed" out for me and I was hooked from the first chapter.
 This book was incredible from the first page to the very last page.  I loved every single character but my favorites were Liesel, Max, Hans, &amp; Rudy.  I did not want the book to end because I feel like I miss these characters.  They kept me company everyday on the train to and from work.  Even though this story is set during the Holocaust and the subject matter is very heavy, it was interesting to hear it from Death's point of view.  Also, the flow of the words and the tone made me feel like I was an invisible person really looking in on the lives of these characters.  I recommend that everyone who has heard of this book should take the time to read it.  You will love it or at least like it very much.
 The story is told in such a unique fashion. I was truly captivated.  I highly recommend this book. I finished it 2 days after purchasing it.
 Great read narrated from a very different perspective.  Once you start it's hard to put down.  Hitler's Germany was not a pleasant place to be if you were an average German family trying to make ends meet, and far worse if you were Jewish.  Well written and captivating book!
 swears, mostly in german, but fairly frequently...in case that concerns you. If it was always in English, it probably would have annoyed me, but since I don't speak much German, it was easy enough to ignore.<br/><br/>Excellent story. Also an Excellent audio book.<br/><br/>I found the beginning (where he introduces the narrator) A bit mucky.  Once I was past that though, loved it.
 A gift
 I absolutely fell in love with the story and its characters. I hope the movie does it justice. Zusak is an exceptional writer and I thoroughly enjoyed his story telling style. The Book Thief captured my imagination and my heart. I was captivated by both the extreme tragedy the characters endured as well as their tiny treasured moments which many of us would take for granted today. This book is truly something special.
 Perfect, just what my son wants.
 Beautifully written.  Raw feelings of great  loss, abandonment anrd fear are very slowly transformed in this lonely child as she learns what love and family mean.
 This is the kind of book like "To Kill A Mockingbird" that may be read in HS's, but that doesn't make it a book just for young adults.  Expertly written and meaningful, I highly recommend this as a "coming of age" story.
 When I first started reading this book, I rolled my eyes, who cares what death thinks! Right? But the more I read the more this book the more it gripped me and it was if I was right along with the characters, they essentially became alive. Enjoyed the book and plan on watching the movie when it comes out!
 This book is horribly written. It jumps around and seems to speak on circles. I waited the whole book for some kind of plot but it never came.
 This book is best described as hauntingly beautiful. The voice of this is powerful and unique. It is the story of war, courage and the power of words to change peoples’ lives/perceptions. Two things make this book standout: death is the narrator and the primary characters are Germans hiding Jews in the middle World War II. I cannot say enough glowing words about this book.
 The Book Thief definitely surprised me. What an enthralling and addicting piece. I never thought I would not be able to put it down. I've read plenty of books based in WWII Europe, but never WWII Germany and never something that pulled me in so closely that I felt I was part of the Huberman family. A beautiful book, definitely read it before you see the movie. Enjoy!
 I enjoyed the book thief very much.  It had a lot of people to keep track of, with many difference stories jointing together.  The story took place during ww2,  The young Germany children life during the war.. The love story between a couple, and a Germany girl and jew.  I found I could not stop reading this story.  I guess I never read this side of the war.  I know everyone would love the great book.
 I only recently heard about this novel while talking with a stranger on the bus about good novels. She highly recommended this especially because I am interested in the lives of ordinary Germans and Jews during the Nazi reign of terror. I was not disappointed. Although it took a little while to get used to the author's writing style, I was totally immersed in this sweet, sad and tragic novel. Don't miss it.
 It is difficult for me to put into words.  This story evoked a huge range of emotions.  I want my friends to read it so we can process it together.  Who knew the other side of the fence was so difficult.  Of course we know. We just are unable to express the horror and pain.  Well done Mr. Zusak.  Well done.
 I thought the story was very good.  What I didn't care for was the author's choice of relating the story in a 3rd person format.  For the first several chapters, I didn't know who was telling the story.  God?  Satan?  The Grim Reaper?  I thought the story would've been much better if they had just told the story.
 While I liked the film very well, the book eclipses it.  Even if you've seen the film, I hope you read the book. If I could give it four-and-a-half stars I would.  Original, compelling, well-written, evokes the cold, harsh agony the characters suffer while wit and hope burn through.  Highly recommended.
 This is the first book that I have read by Markus Zusak and it will not be the last.  His unique style of writing captured my interest from the first paragraph and kept it to the last. He breaths life into his characters and makes you care what happens to them.
 This book is thought provoking in a time of great world stress.  It depicts a struggle for survival both physical and spiritual.  The characters are warm, harsh and a combination of both at the same time.  The author's style is complex yet easy to follow as the rader gets deeper into the story plot.
 I found the perspective imaginative and perfect for the story.  I had always wondered about the German people and their experiences during the war. I rated the book a five because this book is important for all Americans to read and be moved as I deeply was- to know that we are all humans and should not be labeled by the acts of others without regard to truth.
 I enjoyed the story a lot but I didn't like the perspective the narrator gave.  I thought the narrator ruined a lot of would be touching or said moments by blurting out randomly when something was going to happen months or years in the future.
 I loved this book.  It was a real tear jerker because it's characters seemed so real and their circumstances were so difficult.  If you like World War II era historical fiction, this book is for you.  The period comes to life with antisemitism and the problems of German Occupation.  How the characters deal with these ciricumstances is nothing short of heroic.  The children in the book illustrate how difficult it is to be a child in war times.
 Most books regarding the holocaust are from the point of view of the persecuted.  This book is so well written and unique.  It's from the perspective of a 10 year old girl who is not persecuted but living though the insanity that was Nazi Germany.  I would make this mandatory reading in high school
 This novel gave us the Perspective of  ordinary small town German citizens during  WWII.  Told from a young girl's point of view.  She became a heroine by reading to the neighbors as they were crowded together in a basement during air raids.  The story carries her through her lifetime.  The author does a great job of bringing the different characters to life.  Well written and most interesting.  X
 This is a beautiful haunting story. I countined to think about it long after the final page. The tragic story of a little girl and the people who become her family, set in Hittler controlled Germany, in the time leading up to and during World War Two.
 This book.... I read it in pieces. It was hard in places to get past towards the end. Especially since death prepares you for what's coming. It was so well written. Narrated by death, it tells the story of a young girl in Germany during WWII. I think this is one people are either going to love, or hate.
 A great read for students who may be learning about the holocaust.  I love how it came from another perspective rather than just the main character.
 This is an excellently written book.  The opening of every chapter starts with a list of events that he, "death" (the narrator) will tell us about.  It's setting is Germany throughout WWII.  It offers great character development and gives the reader a glimpse of life in Germany at that time.  It's sweet and heartfelt - well worth a read.
 One of the best books I have read in a long time.  I loved the point of view throughout and the characters were so well drawn and for once, I really cared about them and wanted to know them deeply.  Highly recommend this book to any reader, young or old.
 Bought as a gift and they seem happy with it.
 Terrific read. Incredibly moving...very real and heartbreaking. I<br/>couldn't put this book down. I found myself caring deeply<br/>about the characters and once again hating everything about the<br/>Nazis, their followers and those who remained silent to the<br/>atrocities.
 I was slightly confused at first but then I started understanding as I read. You have to read quite a ways before you understand it. I thought it was amazing. I always thought it would be a confusing book but no it wasn't to confusing. I just didn't like how it suddenly ended. I was left like what the neck happened to max after this, does he die of tuberculosis or what. I really liked it though. It was very how would u say this ummm.... solid.
 One of the most unique books I've ever read... I'm not sure why this is considered a YA novel, because it definitely seemed more geared for adults to me.  I really enjoyed this book.
 The story of the book thief is at once funny, touching, unnerving, heartbreaking.  It weaves together what is best and worst in humanity, while always maintaining a sense of hope and a belief in humanity.  A truly masterfully told story.
 This is by far the best book I have ever read!!  I also have it in Audible which is outstanding!!  I have even gone so far as to buy additional copies to share with my best friends.  It touched every emotion and feeling.  I can't say enough wonderful things about it.
 Definitely entertaining and worth a read. However given all the hype I did expect more.Would I recommend it, yes sure, but I don't think its for everyone. I tried to watch the movie. There are some books that just don't translate well to the silver screen, especially if you have read the book. This is one of them.
 One of the most engaging books I've ever read.  Such a good story and it rattled me at points when I saw things in an unexpected light.  There were moments in the book that were powerful and profound, maybe even life changing.  I would recommend this book to everyone!
 If a book is great you do not want to put it down . This book was interesting as I like to learn about the holocaust . I had good visuals while reading it , which was a good thing . I ended up putting the book down and reading another in between and then going back to it . But all in all it was an ok book .
 I really enjoyed this novel &amp; the characters were well written. I especially liked who narrated the story. It brought alive living under Nazi rule &amp; how it affected the people. Liesel, the main character, was very strong &amp; very brave for such a young girl. I would recommend this book.
 Words are powerful. We must always remember. They can be inspiring and life-affirming or hateful and hideous.<br/>The pensive and purposeful narrator of this amazing collection of expositions uses the life of a German girl  during World War II to illustrate both acutely.
 Outstanding book! I highly recommend it.
 I had a hard time putting this book down.  My son saw the movie before I started to read the book so I knew how it ended, however, while I was reading the book I tried to not let that knowledge affect me and I immersed myself in the characters.  I loved the book and am looking forward to seeing the movie.
 This was a story which was hard to put down because of the way in which it was written.  The plot was not necessarily unusual but the  manner of its writing was refreshingly different.  I chose to purchase "The Book Thief" after seeing promotions for the movie and was not disappointed.<br/><br/>One small hiccough in the Kindle e-book  edition was the print size for "The Word Shaker".  With my limited technological ability, I was unable to increase the font size for this section and so could not actually read Max's book.  This did not detract too greatly from my enjoyment of the book as a whole.<br/><br/>A cleverly written story.
 This is one of those quiet books that lives with you a while. The writing is superb. I purchased the book after seeing the trailers for the movie but now that I have read it I'm a little afraid to watch the movie because i don't know how it can possibly live up to the evocativeness of the book.
 ****Spoilers ahead****<br/>And so sad! I know that a book set in WWII Germany, narrated by Death was bound to be sad. You have to be in the mood for tragedy when you pick this one up, folks. By the second half of the book I couldn't put it down. I loved every character &amp; am not ashamed to say I wept over losing most of the them.
 I really never gave much thought to other families who helped the Jews during the war. The book thief opened my eyes, opened my mind and touched my heart. I traveled Himmel street while I read the book.  When I can see the characters and scenery, feel that I am there, I consider it a great book.
 One of the best books I've ever read and I easily read 40-45 books/year. It would be in my top 3 of all time. I bought this copy for my dad, who loved it so much that he bought it for my aunt.
 I absolutely loved this book! It was a little difficult to get into at first - the style was a bit different, but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down.  The characters had such depth, and the book allowed the reader to experience such a wide range of emotions.  I found myself wanting to reread this book after I finished, because it was so perfect.
 We forget so fast that we have the USA. How did I happen to be born now and here?  I am thankful.
 I love this book!  Tears... they just appeared on my cheeks as I read the final few chapters, and the foreshadowing.... Markus Zusak knows how to craft a compelling story with deep, flawed, and still beautifully lovable characters.  I hope that this book resonates with me for many years to come!
 It isn't really easy to read such truths, but how else we will we learn from history?  This is a remarkable and unique story about how the people of Germany who remained in their homes and neighborhoods during WWII were affected.  A good read.
 Great book! I've read it twice and will be keeping it to read again.
 This book is beautifully written and it's something you'll want to reread even after you've finished it.<br/>It's under young adults but it's for mature adults as well since there are so many lessons to be learned.<br/>Feelings of isolation, loneliness, hurt but also themes of belonging, love and responsibility are all part of this book.<br/>It can get a little confusing with "Death" as the narrator but it's extremely creative. I don't know how<br/>accurate all the details are but once again we are reminded of the horrific events of the holocaust.<br/>The only thing is it might be a bit long but otherwise you won't be disappointed. 100% recommended!
 One of the best books I've read in a long time  - original in phraseology and structure. Used as required reading in many high schools, which is good, shedding light on a period of history many of today's youth know nothing about. Thanks to Markus Zusak for giving us this readable and thoughtful story!
 This book is so sad and yet so great. it made me think about living in those times, the resilience of people and it reminded me that although there's a certain stigma about the Germans, that they too were victims of the war and of Hitler's insanity. I also love the narration of 'Death' in this book.
 I found this book to be both leaving me wanting more, and yet I was more than satisfied with the ending.  Liesel, the main character, was such a tangible and well developed character that you just wanted to embrace her/take care of her/rescue her, yet she did not need rescuing. She rescued herself, and the voice of the narrator .... Somewhat a spoiler alert: the grim reaper, came to be not someone to dread, but someone you felt you would not be nervous or fearful about meeting, but almost like a long lost friend you found comfort in meeting. This is a great book for both genders, and the young and the old!  Loved it!
 Just be ready to cry.... A lot. But seriously what a great book. This story about an orphan girl growing up in nazi Germany and tells a side to a story that has been mostly ignored. Her experience growing up during the third reicht, losing people she loves, and learning to read and write is told from the point of view of death himself. Really good.
 To follow Liesel's journey guided by Death brought me joy, pain, laughter, sorrow, confusion, understanding and adventure! It changed me in a good way.
 The story as sad as it was was one of hope and survival through human kindness and compassion. Characters whose fragility was tested on a daily basis during the Hitler reign. How something as simple as the reading of a book by an adolescent brought some peace to a small town subjected to the atrocities of that time.
 A poignant story which helps the reader to understand all the complicated feelings, hardships and pressures put on the German people during this terrible time in history. It is told from a unique perspective and describes how one girl struggles to cope with all that has happened to her and the people around her. I won't forget it soon.
 I LIKED THIS BOOK VERY MUCH.  IT GAVE A GOOD LOOK AT WHAT THE GERMAN PEOPLE  ENDURED, ESPECIALLY THE CHILDREN.  I HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE GETTING STARTED AS THE FORMAT IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I'M USED TO BUT IT IS A BOOK WORTH READING.  I HAVE ALREADY RECOMMEDNED  IT TO SEVERAL FRIENDS.
 This is so great.  I loved it, as did my 14 yo daughter and my 60-something yo father.  Please buy, borrow, whatever.  One of the best books I have read in years.  Somehow even though the subject matter is a familiar and heartbreaking one, this book is fresh and offers an interesting perspective.  So well written, it hooks you right away.  Get it for yourself and your (mature) teen.  (and your dad)
 Interesting book.  Found the beginning a bit confusing ( the use of color to describe the scene) but think that was due to the author unique approach and style, different than anything else I have read.  Good character development. An insightful look at a German town and it's people during WWII.
 The book was great, but the book came in with the cover damaged. There were also pages slightly ripped and dog eared throughout the book. The handling was horrible it had no protection whatsoever, just a box that the book barely fit in.
 After watching the movie, I hesitated in reading the book. The movie was great, but it was to me a different story. Zusak's characters were not black and white people, which I found interesting and as an adult I could understand both Liesl's POV and a grown up perspective. Why the movie chose to make some of the people seem more like the bad guys I don't understand.  I was able to see many different types of people were not the devout Nazis they were supposed to be and Death's views on humanity instead of the whole right and wrong issues were both interesting sections to me. I wasn't prepared to feel compassion for anyone who was a Nazi, even if they were only a fictional character.<br/><br/>This isn't the first time I've read Death as a character and often I find Death is as involved with the humans in the story as I, the reader, am. I suppose it's a bit like bird watching, I enjoy all the birds and even though they squabble amongst themselves I am an outsider and therefore don't feel as passionately about what happens between them. I can appreciate each one and find beauty in all of them. Death is a lot like this in The Book Thief.<br/><br/>I wasn't quite sure about the ending of the book, Liesl's end of life left many questions for me. I tried to piece what I saw in the movie and match it up with the book, but am not sure if that's how Mr. Zusak saw it. This was a hundred times better than the movie and I loved the movie.<br/><br/>This book is appropriate for both older children and adults. I think children should discuss the book with an adult after they've read it, because the whole WWWI and WWWII topic is something that should be talked about frankly and openly.<br/><br/>Great job Markus Zusak!
 I loved the Book Thief! For those who are interested in books like The Boy in the Striped Pajamas and other stories based around the Holocaust, it will break your heart and give you wonderful insight to the past and appreciation for the lives we are blessed with today.
 Can’t believe I have never read this book, a classic!
 I loved this book and didn't want it to end.  It gave me a deeper perspective of the human suffering and amazing strength of people living during the invasion of Nazi Germany.  The writer's gift of telling the story through a child's innocent eyes contrasted with the atrocities was spellbounding.
 Bought for school
 One of my favorite books of all time. It's so different, so beautifully written and one of the most powerful stories about the devastation of war I've ever read. The characters will haunt you long after you've finished the story.
 Wow.... great book. The author's personification of death was powerful and the story of the poor girl was humbling,sad and extremely unfortunate. If you haven't read this book, you have done yourself great wrong.
 Excellent book
 Initially I wasn't sure if I would like the writing style, but I quickly realized I was wrong. I connected with the characters and this book was a great way for me to catch a glimpse of what day to day life must have been like growing up during the dawn of WWII in Germany.
 It started off a bit disjointed.  Once I got the hang of the flow it was very interesting.  A different look at an awful time in our history.  I was reminded of the Diary of Anne Frank.  Please, if you are going to see the movie, don't read the book.  The movie leaves a lot to be disired.
 Emotionally complex. The characters are well developed. The story's word pictures transport the reader to Nazi Germany during World War II. I was moved to tears throughout my reading, which is not common for me. I rarely re-read books, but I feel the need to revisit this one. I will be thinking about this one for a very long time.
 Great book! Good read for a rainy day, I would buy it again in a heart beat!
 My son read this book multiple times and kept telling me to read it. I finally ran out of reading material and decided to give it a try. I struggled with the narration style at first but quickly fell in love with the story. This is a beautiful,well written story that I will read again and again.
 I know I am  only one of many who read "the book thief" and found it to be an outstanding read, but I am glad to add my  voice.  I have read many books and have seen many documentaries concerning the holocaust and aspects of WWII, but this perspective was so well done.  It is a thought provoking and well developed story captured so beautifully by author Markus Zusak.  I highly recommend it.
 I was hesitant to read this book.  I read the first few pages several times.  Once I got past those pages, I was sucked into the book very quickly.  It's a great book.  I highly recommend it.
 Very good book. Hard to get into, but once you're hooked, you're hooked! Interesting take on a time period that most want to forget. We often read of the suffering of the Jews, but this story speaks to the suffering of the Germans who had no choice but to bend under the rule of Hitler.
 Wonderful. Sad. Epic. Filled with love for words and reading. Inspiring. Magical. The narrator was so peaceful and kind. My favorite forever. Will read again in a few years.
 Beautifully written book about Nazi Germany in the late thirties and forties. Book will keep you enchanted to find out what is going to happen next. A most interesting story line with extremely well developed characters. Three years to write - this story is well developed and a wonderful read.
 This is a wonderful book about life among the Germans during World War II.  It was very well written and described how hard life was for ordinary citizens and difficult choices that the common person had to make.  It is the story of children during the war.  This is a "must read" and is definitely worthy if a second read.  Great book.
 With rave reviews I expected a little more.  While this novel provides an interesting point of view about WW2, I didn't have to hurry to my book.  I never felt that I just had to know what was going to happen.  It was good, it was interesting, it was different, but it did not compel me to continue reading day and night.
 This is a wonderful story of what occured in Germany with Hitler and his group of men that hated Jews and any others that did not follow their rules.  I will never understand how these people lived with themselves. Hitler killed over 11 million people.  What makes a person so hateful?
 Death and many stings. A girl and a second family and a boy and two boys who like to fight. One wins and the other died.
 Very sad tale but always good to be reminded of historical horrors like Hitler's reign. Entire book narrated by "death" - I was ambivalent about that (sometimes I really disliked this aspect of the book but other times, it felt very appropriate.) I saw the movie first and one of the rare stories where I liked the movie better than the book. But now I want to see the movie again.
 This is a very good book.  I'm looking forward to watching the movie when it comes out in DVD.  I've been to Germany a couple of times just recently and it's hard to believe that these things happened right where I stood not that many years ago.  Reading it has been a great history lesson and reminder to me.
 The writing is beautiful... So many times I went back and re-read sentences just to let them soak in. The characters are so real, you feel like you know them. I ugly-cried my way through the end, sobbing for these people I now loved. Wonderful, wonderful, heart-breaking story.
 Great
 When I saw that this book had been adapted to film, I knew I wanted to read it. I am so happy I did. It truly is a hauntingly lovely piece of work. Liesel's character embodies hope and her view on life during such a tragic time resonates with the reader. This book is a must read for all ages.
 Why oh why is this exquisite multifaceted multilayered book being only marketed as young adult? I almost didn't buy it because of the age it claims to be for-I am 56 and a quality literature maven. The Book Thief is one of the most extraordinary books I have read- the quality of writing, the story, the honesty, the wisdom are all rare and unique. I will be reading it again slowly to savor its words.
 This story comes from such a unique narrator (death).  "Death" is a great storyteller who makes all the characters so real and describes them and their personal stories in such a way I felt I could actually see, smell and feel each character's situation.  Masterful job of writing.
 13 year old son couldn't put this book down.
 Very well written book. It reminds me that "We always live in  the best of times and the worst of times". There are always good people, bad people and people in between,  Even if you are on the right side of history the other side suffers also,
 While this is another story of the Jewish tragedy in Germany, it is not typical.  The Book Thief moved me to tears and opened my eyes to the suffering endured by some of the German community during the time of Hitler while not diminishing the suffering of Jews.  I highly recommend this book.
 Good book
 One of the best books I've ever read.  Heart wrenching.  A lovely book.  Highly recommended.
 This book, as told by the Grim Reaper, was a story not to be forgotten in a long while.  Its covers Nazi Germany, from the German point of view, by two young children.  What it was like to be in the Hitler Youth group, to life in a very poor section of town, the rationing and the wants and needs of simple German people.  And eating pea soup seven days a week.  The characters came to life for me.  I loved them all.
 This book was so completely emotionally involving for me that it would be difficult for me to explain.  Needless to say, I fell in love with the book and its characters. I will miss them. My favorites aside from Leisel, were Rudy, and Death, actually.  Hans Hubermann had my heart, as well, and later, Rosa.
 Teenager liked it, parents didn't.
 I loved this intriguing novel - very descriptive and revealing of human nature. The unique narration provides a perspective that I hope the movie can somehow provide. Any book lover can identify with the book thief. Any compassionate individual can identify with the other beautiful characters in this story. This book doesn't sugar coat the disturbing holocaust experience, so it is an eye opener too.
 Well written story of loss and love during Hitler's rise to power shared from a young girls perspective. Inspiring, touching and  at times haunting.
 Enjoyed reading this book. The characters are amazing people. Story is filled with WWII in Germany where we witnessed family bonding, friendship, fear, honour and determination. A passion to read even during hard times.
 compelling story, how awful life must hve been in those times, very insightful information about  those caught up in Nazi Germany and the accompanying countries under his control. the inhumanity of the genocide of millions of people and the aftermath of it all.. One little girl thrown into the choas and survives only by the comfort she finds iin her books.
 This is one of the best books I've read in some time. I got the Kindle version, and ended up using the highlight feature a lot.<br/><br/>The prose is heartrendingly, terribly gorgeous. Such perfect words to describe such horrible events; I can't stop thinking about this book. I realized going in that it was probably a tearjerker, and it certainly is that.
 Very special.
 It started with niece needing a book report. We read it out loud. My mom and sister ended up enjoying the book as much my niece.  I loved the writing style that the narrator is death. I love the colors and the discussion on the books of her life. Wonderful. unique writing style. Very inspiring.
 I bought this to read before I go to see the movie.  I liked the book very much.  The writer did over reach with his poetic use of verbs but that did not take away from the story or the characters.  I found the characters interesting and found some thoughtful points to reinforce and expand my value system.
 What an imaginative author.  Writing from Death's point of view was inspired and revealing.  So many superb phrases, I had to stop highlighting. His descriptions were so fresh and new, some took my breath away.  I don't know why I didn't read it sooner.
 Historical Fiction, but still well written, the author reality does now his history, and he had an excellent writing style, but the story is pretty short. The story gets you to know the characters. It made me cry.
 This book was a fantastic read.  Few books tell the story of WWII from the german citizens point of view.  You hear the jewish side.  Most books paint all German's as bad guys, this does not.  Gives you hope that some people could really see the big picture.  I would highly recommend reading this.
 Very pleased. Well packaged for shipment. Love the extras in this edition!
 The Book Thief by Markus Zusak<br/><br/>This was one of the most beautifully written books I have read and I will probably read it again some day. Markus Zusak's style of writing puts you right there with the characters. I have already downloaded another of his books.
 Took me a little bit to figure out much of the story is told from two different characters. At times it was hard to follow the thought process of the author. I did enjoy this book, yet found that I needed to be focused to not lose the storyline. As with many books based around the Holocaust, there is much tragedy.
 I see there's more to find in this book than the most readers highlight. Lines like the Death's Diary 1942 prove just how brilliant the author is. The wordsmith made himself the word master with this book completed.
 I don't reread books but if I did...I would read this again.  There are some lines that are so profound...The characters get to you in the best way...this book is definitely in my top 20 for sure.
 I am not even through yet, but I find the language like nothing I have ever read.  It is so colourful, so way out of the ordinary,  I just wish my grand daughter was 13-14 so that she could read it.  As for the subject matter and how the writer deals with that, I like the way he handles it, I like the way he uses German words and phrases.<br/><br/>I very enjoyable read so far.  I'm sure to the end, too.
 The story is told by Death, and who better to spin a story about WWII  and Hitlers Germany. The difference is that this is seen through the eyes and hearts of regular people, living the best they could with very little. The story is riveting, sad, and rewarding at the same time. I highly recommend  this book
 What a beautiful story! Mark Zusak has an interesting style. He does not simply foreshadow, but instead tells about things coming soon without revealing the end. I loved this story of friendship, family, and overcoming. It certainly had some heartbreaking elements, but it created a very unique description of the horror of the Holocaust and the beauty of some people's response.
 I really enjoyed reading The Book Thief so much<br/> it was hard  to put it down.  You find yourself wanting to hide these people. You really find yourself as one of the characters, you  exactly like this.  I appreciate  the story it is so real and so true,.  Thank for taking the time too write  Greater s book I've red in  a long time! Carol Nash
 When I started the book I was sure I wasn't going to finish it,  I did not like it. The more I got into the story I realized it had a great message and I needed to finish it. The story showed me that there is two sides to a story and that everyone suffered during the war. Not all people are bad and both sides suffered.
 I enjoyed it as much the second time as the first. Also picked up on things I missed the first time.
 I choemjoyed the story. ose this book based upon the ads for the movie. The presentation enjoyed the story.of this book is different than others I have read. Once I was comfortable with whom was narrating I found the story to be sad, funny and heart touching. I recommend this book to all.
 My 14 year-old granddaughter was pleased to receive this for Christmas because the 9th grade English teacher assigned this for January reading and then she will see the movie.  I read it last year and knew a high-schooler would enjoy it
 I've never read a WWII story from a German's perspective before, much less a young girl coming of age. Very powerful story - I loved this and found myself completely immersed in the characters. The tears were flowing from several points in this book, but I am so glad I read it. Highly recommend!!
 Hi, this is a great book.
 Narrated by Death, this story about a young foster girl in Natzi Germany during WW II, was an easy read. The book provides the reader to view Nazi Germany through the eyes of a young girl, who is sent to live in a foster home and finds love, friends and hope.
 A truly hauntingly sad story of devastation, love and hope told through a most unusual narrator during World War ll. Death, words, music, trust and love become integral to the story, in addition to the primary character, Leisel. Perhaps this theme still resonates with people due to the fact words still hold that same power today but are often used through a different medium.
 This is an excellent book .... if, you are interested in what life was like in the 20's, 30's and 40's in Germany.  We living here during this period in history do not have a clue ... This book should be read by one and all.
 This story of loss and bravery leaves us feeling that we would wish to be as Leisel. I am sure that.there were many brave stories from that era.I am finding it difficult to understand that this book would be attractive as a Child's book as the readers really haven't lived long enough to relate to the characters.
 Would recommend it to everyone I know.  Beautifully written.<br/>Will remember it for a long time and may reread it.
 The Holocost through the eyes of a child. Wonderful.
 This book was so interesting I decided to go to see the movie after I had read it. For the life of me I couldn't figure out how they could do that with this book. It is so rich and well written. Compelling characters and such an unusual way to tell the story. I was really happy that I had read the book first.
 I loved this book!  So well written and descriptive. It just put you in the house at that time with this poor family. It also gives an accurate history account of Hitler and the Nazi Party.  A great Christmas present for any young avid reader.
 I enjoyed how death narrates this tail!
 I believe I started to read this book about six months ago and couldn't get into it.  Has a very difficult beginning and I probably wouldn't have kept reading it this time except that I knew they made and have released the movie.  What a tough little girl and what a neat friend she had.  Really enjoyed it.
 I was enthralled by this book from the first line.  I found the setting and storyline interesting if devastating.  The author's use of language engaged and excited me.  I took notes for the first time as a reader without being told to by a teacher and still read them to remind me of the beauty of the words and phrases.  It is a heartrending and beautifully written book.
 I don't remember how it's narrated. But it was a FABULOUS book. Well-written. Even some pictures, (which could make you cry.) A great book. Read it!
 Entertaining
 The book was a little difficult to get into at first until I understood who the narrator was. After that it was harrowing. I certainly had never thought of what it was like for the German people going through World War 2 and the hardships that were endured and the repercussions if they assisted a Jewish person.<br/>Would highly recommend the book.
 The Book Thief was a very good book.  It made you want to keep reading to see what would happen next.  Makes you go back in history and actually see what the people lived through during that horrible time period.  What a sad, sad time in human history.  I highly recommend this book.
 Finally got around to reading this book and loved it! Couldn't put it down! Really easy read but super entertaining
 Cuz you shouldn't have to fight back tears. This is a very compelling story of a young German girl told by Death, as<br/>Narrator.  I highly recommend this book as a different viewpoint of a familiar horror story in our history.
 Enjoyed this book very much.  Short but fun. The story keeps your interest hand is suspenseful.  I couldn't put it down.
 I'd like to give this book a 4.75 stars actually. Wonderfully written with a compelling story and interesting characters. I have to say as you get to the end you can't help but nearly shed a few drops of tears for the people who suffered during the war in Germany. Bravo to the writer in writing a book that focused more on the characters rather than the troubled times and bravo to a book which was narrated, interestingly, by the oddest of person(?)! Anyway you'd be gripped to the book all the way through, so I highly recommend this book.
 When I find a book that I cannot put down until I have finished the last page AND then am sad that it is ended, I know I have found a great book.  The author gives the reader a great insight into how Hitler's war affected all of the people of Germany, especially those people who opposed his ideas and actions.
 I am so very grateful that this book was recommended to me. It relates a different image of the Holocaust from the perspective of a survivor NOT from the concentration camps. The ironies are poignant. Choosing death as the narrator was a stroke of genius. Although I just finished the story, I want to read it again. Truly a story to savor.
 What a wonderful read.  I couldn't put it down.  I wasn't sure I would like it, but decided to order it anyhow.  Needless to say it was one of the best books I've read in quite awhile.  Also, I found out that at the high school where I work, was using this book as a required book.
 I really enjoyed reading the Book Thief. The beginning is a bit strange and leaves kind of a hollow feeling as the book is narrated by death. But the story of the bonds created and then broken by tragedy is something we can all relate to.<br/><br/>The story was so well written I feel as though I spent time on the street of the main character and I feel her pain and loss.
 I had seen the movie, which was okay, not great.  But I knew that movies were usually made from books that a lot of people love so I wanted to read it.  First I looked at the reviews and there were some that were negative, hence the comment that I read with doubt.  I found the book to be very good.  It is not written in the standard chronological order which some of the reviewers didn't like.  I thought that the style of writing added to the emotions that this sad time in history evokes in a way that prefect chronological order would not have achieved.  And now I like the movie better too!
 I found this book slow and difficult to read in the beginning. Somewhere right in the middle I picked it up and couldn't put it down. I literally had tears rolling down my face at the descriptions of how the story unfolds. I wish I got a little more of how Liesel managed to cope after all that happened though.
 I enjoyed reading this book because it transported me to an ordinary German village in the midst of a horrific war.  The narrator's tells the story from a unique vantage. Simple and complex. Rich emotions. Tearful in the end. I recommend this book, but not merely to be entertained, but to reflect.
 I had pre-conceived ideas what this book would be like but wasn't prepared for the emotional journey that followed.  The story is told in a unique and moving way that holds your interest and takes you back in time to a world reeling with war and injustice.  We see it from a young girl's eyes and watch as the story unfolds.<br/>I would recommend this book as an inspiration to everyone and particularly to those that have been fortunate to live a sheltered life.
 All though very sad at the same time enlightening<br/>  A different version about Hitler.  I can't say I enjoyed this book, yet I couldn't put it down. I can't say I didn't enjoy it because enjoy isn't the word, engrossing, magnetic that is what I would say..  Mama loved in her own way.  They were good people.  The suffering was enormous, the hunger, yet the kids played.  Read this book.  The author had s beautiful writing style, complicated yet very easy.  I read a good deal about the holocaust years and I loved this way of approaching the story.  Thank you mark for writing this book.
 I absolutely loved this book! I'm German blood, and books that take place during the holocaust are my interest. This book had me laughing, and crying within minutes and the turning of a few pages.. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has interest in WW2. Comparable to the feelings I experienced with "The Boy in Striped Pajamas." Fantastic read. Finished  it in 2 days, I just couldn't put it down!
 This was a different, but good book. It has been awhile since I read it, so I can't give a detailed review. I would recommend it to someone looking for a good read.
 This was a hard book to read because of the subject matter. I imagine the movie they made of it was hard to watch, but I learned a lot from this book and the characters were drawn well. I cared about the characters and might just have to read it again to see if I missed something.
 I do not like to give away the plot, as some people do, but I will say the book is worth reading. The characters became very real to me through the authors excellent writing. It is both sad and humorous and I was so disappointed to reach the end.  If you want to know more, you should read the book.
 I really enjoyed this book. One of the best books I have read in the last couple of years, and I am an avid reader. The book is very touching and beautifully written. I found the prologue to be a bit confusing and difficult to read and almost quit there. But I am very glad I kept on reading. It's an excellent book.
 Two evenings of reading enjoyment.  This book was written from a very unusual perspective. I fell right into the the life of the main character. Underlying this young girl's life the the bigger fact that no matter how much you try to change the outcome, life has it's own plan for all of us.
 I am currently working my way through the top 100 bestsellers list produced by NZ Whitcolls. This is listed #12. I agree. It would be more or less where I would place it from my experience so far with a vast range of books I have read over the years. If you like a story which gives you some emotion, whether it’s laughing or crying. You’ll get the later with this one.<br/>Read it and get it on your book list.
 Another tragic presentation of Nazi horrors and how the people, even those who wished to stop Hitler and his maniacs, were cowered into submission.  Very, very few bright spots from the German people during Hitler's reign of terror (I am of German heritage although this period in history is a permanent embarrassment to me).
 This book should be read by all!!  Its an interesting book and it relates  to what went on during a certain era;  we forget what happens<br/>then.  It takes you thru some challenging times and at the end it turns out to be not so bad.  Just read it --  it is worth your time!!
 Great writing and brings the reader into the world of a young girl in Germany during World War II. Death is the narrator - interesting concept. Well worth the time to read for those who love history. Amazing descriptions of time and place. The book on tape reader did a beautiful job.
 I just could not put it down. I was captured by the intensity of family, friendship and love.  It was filled with heartbreak and heart-strength. A truth about those who have caused human suffering , their despicable cold-hearted greed, and those who rose above.  Everyone should read this!!  All age groups
 It's a quick read that adds to the legacy of books that must be read from time to time to remind us all of the evil potential of mankind, even today.  It's a love story. It's a compassionate, sweet story.  It's a nightmare story revealing mankind's love of power, control and greed and hatred for things we don't understand or accept.  Every human over 10 should invest a couple days to read it.
 I didn't think this would be a book that would hold my attention if I was to read it on my kindle, but I thought it would be great for my hour and a half commute to and from work three days a week and I was right! Definitely would recommend it to anyone who wants to hear about a family who lived in Germany and weren't  isolated because of their religion, sexuality, profession, nationality, etc.
 Perfect
 A very interesting twist. Death does not usually write a story.  It's a very sad story but with a twist at the end.  We all know war is hell, but to live through the pain was just too sad for me. It was an effort to finish the book. It did not leave me satisfied. Just too much misery for me.
 Unique in every way, this story is touching, tragic, and at the same time funny and tender.  It is a peek into a somber time where survival was never a given, yet life still managed to plod along.  Told through the observances of an unlikely narrator, the story twists and turns culminating in devastation and disbelief with strength and endurance rising out of the ashes.
 My grandmother and I read this together then talked about it before she passed last year. It was a great book and now a wonderful memory for me. I plan on reading it with my daughter.
 "The Book Thief" brings the years of WW Ii in NAZI Germany to life through the eyes of death himself, who is the narrator of this extraordinary tale. It is a love story; it is an amazingly realistic picture of everyday life in a country in the grip of madness; it is the story of the painful and ennobling childhood of an amazing young girl who struggles with agonizing personal loss to find the meaning of the love of a parent and of a stranger. Truly one of the best books I have read in many years.
 While I heard this was written for young adults and I'm far from there I found it good for all.  Actually more for adults than young people because of its dark content. Well written about a girl in Nazi Germany it gave a real inside look into what the people went through. Many times all you read about makes all Germans Nazis which they were not. This showed you the other side. I really loved it.
 I took this book with me on my Caribbean cruise and I found it hard to put down. The story is very well told and left me want ing to know more. Several times I was in tears around the ships pool.  I am sure people thought I was upset with my husband. HA  I really enjoyed this story.
 In THE BOOK THIEF the narrator appears to be the Angel of Death, though that name is never used.  Although I found that an odd choice, I was willing to just go with it.  The story was an engaging World War II /Holocaust tale.  Although it is hard to read about the Holocaust, it seems that every book set in that  time gives another piece of the picture, helping those of us born later to better understand it. The end was a tear-jerker, but at least somewhat in a good way. I am glad I read it.
 Unique writing style and beautifully written. I loved that we got the German perspective and it wasn't all bad moments; I cried and I smiled. I highly recommend this novel. I will have to read more from this author.
 I enjoyed the history in the story and truly got an idea of what it was like during that time. I enjoyed the "irregular" way this was written and how I was surprised by what I was told...in advance. Yet I continued to read on knowing what was to happen. At no point was I bored or wanting to get through it. It was an easy read for me because it was so interesting and enjoyable.
 Loved the narrator...what a great way to get a different perspective! Loved the story line and Leisel's love of life. Loved the way books brought her closer to those she loved. Loved the incorporation of Max, the 'Jew', and how there was no prejudice in Leisel's family. Even Rose, who was difficult, was very accepting. Great for teens and adults alike!
 I thought this could have been accepted as a realistic reproduction of life at the time in Germany where people could not even trust their closest friends. Despite this ,many risks were taken by good people in the face of certain death if they were exposed.<br/><br/>I could see myself witnessing the experience of the principal characters.<br/><br/>Almost a page turner for me.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to seeing the film.
 The setting is Nazi Germany during WWII, during a time when not all Germans were in favor of Hitler. It is the story of a family and how they adapt while protecting themselves and others. A tale of innocence and intrigue told with grit and grace. I couldn't put it down!
 The very best-- stunning prose...<br/>This author writes so that you SEE every word, every scene, every character. His descriptive writing is exceptional and the story is beautiful. The very best book I've read in a very long time.  I didn't pay much attention to the included movie scenes. I was already seeing everything in my mind.
 The style is unique.  The author creates a nice blend between focusing on some small detais along with keeping the "big picture" in mind.  I also enjoyed the use of a "punch line" constantly through the story.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend the book as a quick and educational read.
 This is a book everyone should read, youth and adult.  It provides an authentic picture of the trials of living in Nazi Germany as an ordinary citizen without legitimizing the behavior of most.
 There have  been many books I've  read and wished they could go on an  on. With this book, I almost cried when I finished. I do not claim literary arts as one of my strong points, but I can recognize this book as a magnificent piece of baffling  creativity. I cannot imagine Markus Zusak's creative  process and dare say I understand  only minimal symbolism in this novel, but enjoyed The Book Thief on dramatic and historical levels.
 This is one of the best books I've read.  The way it's written I cannot explain, you have to read it yourself :)  The characters are beyond awesome.  The story is not a thriller, it doesn't have a super intensive climax, it's just like a perfect wave you ride out til the end... AWESOME
 The beauty of this story will tear your soul from its heart, leaving you the reader, ghastly amazed knowing the chapters continue to be pinned with each passing moment of living and departing, loving and hating, healing and destroying.
 I was mesmerized from the first chapter on. I usually don't like war stories, but this novel was captivating. A visceral exploration into a world I am fortunate not to have experienced, but grateful for that glimpse into that part of history.
 I was recovering from the shingles and downloaded the Book Thief on my kindle.  It kept me occupied several nights, too good to put down.  I liked reading the "other side" of the war story of '41, of German people who didn't believe in Hitler and suffered, too.
 Needed this for school. Came perfect.
 I thoroughly enjoyed reading this historical fiction book about a little girl who loves books!  The story was rich with characters who came alive under the author's pen.  I would recommend this book to everyone who loves historical fiction.  I've already loaned it to my daughter.
 Five stars seems to fall short when it comes to Authur, Markus Zusak’s, unique and astounding approach to an historial event which is centered around the time of Nazi Germany. Both the characters and the narration; through the eyes and ears of death (itself) is a genius approach and addictive hook!! This is a page turner like never before. The imagery within this story is constant throughout.  The altering between perspectives throughout the chapters in this story is both perfected and profound. This is a MUST READ for everyone. Extremely well written. Amazing!!!
 This was given away as a gift.
 I picked this book after a friend told me it was her favorite book.  I find it very challenging to read books about Nazi Germany but this is a kids book, right?  It's unbelievably well written, with beautiful terse sentences that create an elaborate world. Sad, charming, full of life and death this book is wonderful.
 I loved this book, I could not put it down until it was finished.<br/>I grew up in UK during the  war and although we did not have to bear all the experiences of the people in the book, the capture of the Jewish people and their terrible treatment I could still identify with the terror of the bombings and the rush for the shelters. The loss of loved ones both at home and on the war front. Running through it all was the story of kids growing up and surviving against the odds. Mainly a story of a young deprived girl fighting against almost impossible odds. A fantastic story.
 I admit it took me awhile to "get into" the book. Death is the narrator. The author does a beautiful job with figurative language. His metaphors are "to die for."
 I only got a little ways the first time I started reading this book.  The second time I was determined to read the whole thing.  Very slow going but I made it through. I don't mean to disrespect the subject matter of this book, but it was very  tedious and a little boring for me.
 Although I initially did not like the author's choice of death, or the grim reaper, as the narrator, I managed to get past that.  I became totally absorbed in this story  of a little girl growing up in severe poverty in Nazi Germany.  She and most of the other main characters were not Jewish, or Nazi's, but suffered nonetheless.  I finished the book with a different understanding of how ordinary Germans were as much victims as the citizens of many other countries.
 As humans in a world we may never understand, it is heartwarming to know that life always allows us the choice to love.  We cradle it always deeply in our souls where  only our thoughts reside.  What a tribute The Book Thief made to our purpose here in Earth School.  Kudos to Marcus !
 Fantastic book ❤
 Couldn't wait to find out what happened next!!  I really liked the characters in the story.  I liked the way the author described in detail the different settings of the story!  So sad but also very interesting to read about.
 This book set in Nazi Germany takes a different approach to that time and those events.  It is written from a entirely different point of view than what we are accustomed to, and that makes the story / stories surprisingly unique.  I think those in their early to mid teens, especially, would enjoy this book.
 My absolute favourite book of all time, surpassing my previous favourite book of 20 years! Everything about it spoke to me on a deep level and at times, I felt the words were so delicious I could eat them. Markus Zusak is a legend.
 Great story. You need to add this to your to read pile. I listened to it so it went fast and the angel of death was kinda cool. You forget that heaven had a lot of work to do or hell depending on your belief. His take was Interesting.
 great book!
 This book is about a girl growing up in Nazi Germany and all the troubles they were faced with . It is told by death and that takes some getting used to. Once you get into the book you don't want to put it down<br/>I would recommend it .
 Still can't get this one out of my head.  It's one of the more memorable books I have read.  I found it a little challenging to be drawn into the story but after about twenty pages, I was hooked. Thank you Markus Zusak for sharing such a wonderful story.
 At first I was put off by the book - Having Death as the narrator is a bit unusual but I kept reading and fell in love with the characters.  good for older teens but the uncontrollable scenes of death taking place to the young girls brother than parents is disturbing and might be too much for yournger teens
 A story that captured me and was evocative.  Showed several perspectives that may have been what those living in Germany during the war experienced.  The final point hammered home at the end of it all was that words and people using them can be for good or for evil and all in between, but words are very powerful.  I've read about 4 or 5 books this year that offer other perspectives of those who went through that terrible horrible war. Zusak gets my mention for doing it best.
 The book is excellent with the author writing from the perspective of  the angel of death.  Thus one could quickly learn about the rise of the third Reich in Germany.
 I read the book then saw the movie unfortunately some parts of the movie were not true to the book, however I enjoyed both tremedously.  Her new father is an example of unbelievable goodness to his fellow human.  The mother though harsh in her words was an angel that took in a young girl that was given away for her safety.
 Took me a long time to get through it but I ultimately enjoyed the book even if it was depressing.  I did not like the introductory mechanism the author used for chapter outlining but the use of the grim reaper as the narrator was very effective.  I was a bit let down at the end but still worth reading.
 A haunting story brilliantly told. Using a personification of Death as the narrator works as a literary device. The language in which the characters and events are described is poetic and mesmerizing. I bought the book after seeing the excellent movie. The book is even better.
 I've read this book twice and seen the movie twice, The characters won't let me go. I've read that the story was based on the author's grandmother's experience during World War II. That must be the energy I feel as I read this wonderful book. I'd read it once more anytime I had the time.
 The narrator captures the feeling and heart of the story and brings you to 1940s Germany.  Thoroughly entertaining and never knowing what is around the corner, the story will hold you and leave you wanting more.
 I don't fancy myself a critic, and this isn't so much a review of the book, as it is the writing itself, so no worries about spoilers. The writing is so rich in allegory, it's almost a song. A long, happy-sad song. It was a pleasure to read, from start to finish. Really a work of art. Thank you, Markus Zusak, for creating this.
 I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Book Thief on my tablet. The characters are very interesting and the author paints a good picture of what it was like to live in Germany during WWII, especially from the perspective of a child. Using Death as the narrator of the book made for a very unique writing style.
 The  people who don't believe the holocaust occurred should read this book.  My family lived it. Even though we are German we lived the starvation and witnessed the horrors the Jews went through, unable to help. It hit too close to home. a great book.
 I read this book from the recommendation of a friend, and was quite surprised by the subject and style of the book as I began reading. Once I got over the initial "shock" of this interesting style, I kept falling deeper and deeper in love with this book. Would definitely recommend!
 This was a little hard to follow in the beginning, but really tells the events of a community in Germany during WWII from the view point of a child.  It allows for the belief in good people despite the actions of a radical few.
 A wonderful book even though the subject matter is NOT wonderful.  The beauty of the spirit that lies in those who are in unfortunate circumstances is uplifting.  Another glimpse into the horror of the Nazi era .  A must read for everyone!
 Charming, beautiful, heartbreaking.  Takes a few chapters to get into, which is why I tried and failed to read this book for several years.  Once I finally stuck to it the pay-off was tenfold.  I won't ever forget the characters in this lovely book.
 the Book Thief ....book is better than the movie.......even though the movie was good.<br/>Fast pace.<br/>Death as narrator was a different twist.\<br/>Have always been fascinated with World War II, even though I<br/>understand the dynamics of Hitler, how can people be beyond cruel.<br/>Then pick up the pieces of life afterwards.
 Although the book is good, it took me awhile to read as it didn't hold my attention. Dragged on in parts
 Really did not like this book. Only read few chapters.
 I read this book at an airport while waiting for our thrice delayed airplane and then finished it on the long flight that followed. I was pleasantly surprised by the emotional depth and the development of the characters in the story. I went into the story not knowing what to expect, and I came out happy that I'd taken the journey. I highly recommend this book to just about everyone.
 This is a wonderful story told by multiple points of view<br/>Its a fast read, and gives you a historic view into what Germans felt like during WW2-kind of like City of Women.<br/>I really liked this book and would highly recommend.<br/>I think they are making a movie from it?
 This is a must read for all book lovers.  The story telling, character development, overall setting of the time in history.....  This is a quick read that will leave a significant impact and made you look at the most challenging human / social issues from a different perspective.
 The way the author makes you know the characters, the senselessness of hate, the explanation of how "words" can destroy humaness, and yet, there are some humans who can remain human...I loved this book.  I was sobbing at the end.
 It was a very touching book. It made me feel as if I was there and experienced everything.<br/><br/>When I was a little girl, I was told that books weren't important. Books helped me deal with a hard childhood and then later helped to me to escape to other places. I love reading and felt just how important books were to Liesel.
 Amazing read! The story is so descriptive, and I can always feel Liesel's emotions. The story seems so real. I would read it again and again and never want to stop.
 Really good book. the movie is boring though fell asleep during it
 I loved this book, as did the other women in my book club. It was a heart-breaker at times. It also really made me understand why most Germans "let it happen"--most had no choice if they and their families were to survive.  Some tried to alleviate the pain and suffering of the Jewish people, often with disastrous results.<br/><br/>The ending was somewhat disappointing to me (I expected more, based on the rest of the book), otherwise I would have given it a 5.
 This is now in my top 10 favorites. I could not put the book down. Told through the voice of death as he watches a young girl live during the holocaust in Nazi Germany. The story takes you to a level of understanding that moves the soul. Even though the subject of course is sad the story is so tender and loving. There is just no good way to say how wonderful this book is. You just have to read it. I read the library copy and had to buy it. It is the kind of book you read more than once and you share with friends. It does have some language in it...but considering the time and what is happening it has it's place.
 ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER
 Phenomenal book that will really give you insight on what it could be like living in WWII Germany as a normal german citizen.  Don't read this if you like happy endings.  Don't read this if you don't want to cry.  If you want to learn and grow with a young lady and her family and friends in their struggles through living in nazi germany, this is a book for you.
 The book held me from beginning to end.i highly recommend it. It is not a happy book but, in some ways, it was a triumph of human spirit. Most of us will never know the terror of what it must have been like to be Jewish during WWII or to be a Jewish sympathizer. This book gives both life.
 Engaging plot, but a lot of cliches in narration style.
 Not all Germans participated in the Nazi takeover of the German mind.  Those that didn't had a hard time of it in order to stay out of the Concentration Camps.  This is the story of some poverty stricken but dignity high people on the outskirts of Munich.  In a way it reads a bit like a 'what about us?' plea pointing out that not only the German Jews suffered.  The family is a made up one of the eponomous 'book thief' a young las whose foster father teachers her to read and as well as Hans the foster father there is Tosa the foster mother whos endearments as genuine but sound savage.  The fourth member of the house hold is Max whom Hans and Rosa house for a long period and the quality of the human relationships between the four people in the house has a noble quality on aching poverty and political and social oppression.<br/><br/>However the novel has a sookie quality.  Its a romance story and we 'know' from the time of the appearance of Max that he would survive the war and that he and the foster child would go off to Australia and make babies.
 This book appealed to me on several levels.....WWII Germany, families in desperate situations, children's lives in limbo, the everlasting importance of knowledge and literature, family and friendship, tolerance and bravery. Historical fiction written from the viewpoint of a German child coming of age during the Holocaust.
 Loved the book after I saw the movie. It didn't make sense at first. But after I saw the movie, I was able to fully grasp the book. Really great writing style.
 Fell in love with the characters.  Most books paint people with the same brush but in this book you can see and understand why they behaved differently during these troubled times.  Peer pressure is very strong  --  with the children -- with the country.  Sad but enlightening story.
 I love books to bring out emotions.  They are hard to find.  This one brought out a lot of emotions in me.  The only problem with the book is that my next book would pale in comparison and not be as much fun To read.
 One of the most poignant, beautiful stories I have ever read in my life.  The prose is so touching and eloquent; you know, the type where you go back and read a sentence over and over.  Towards the end I had to stop to wipe away tears more than once.  This book will stay with me forever.  Very special.
 I liked the book but enjoyed the movie more.  Sometimes it's the other way around but for this particular book/movie the movie was better.  An amazing story, none the less and certainly worth reading.  If you have any interest in WWII this is a must read.
 The story is haunting. Vivid pictures of the characters and their struggles. This shows how the war affected Germans. Those whom we sometimes blame for the war and how they felt.  The story shows their suffering. It draws you in and holds you captive. I enjoyed it very much!
 We should always be reminded of the tragedies of war and it was hard to remember that this was a novel not a true story.  A good book should leave you with an imprint on your mind and heart and this certainly did that.  Written with a different perspective than I have ever encountered before it will stick with me for a long time.  Truly a great read.
 A vivid portrait painted using the powerful words of an unusual narrator telling the story of an unthinkable tragedy. A message of words beyond this beautifully composed story. Creatively and unpredictably constructed. It was a book that I didn't want to end. So well done.
 WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED BUT A GREAT READ - COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN -THE GOOD THE BAD ALL THE CHARTERS WERE BROUGHT TO LIFE THE GOOD WERE NEVER ALWAYS GOOD AND LIKE LIFE THE BAD ARE SOME TIMES GOOD EACH HAD THEIR OWN STORY FEW OF US ARE ONE SIDED YOU UNDERSTAND MORE OF HOW A BAD TIME COULD HAPPEN AND WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN SO DIFFERENT AS THE ADVERAGE PERSON JUST TRYING TO SURVISE
 This book worked for me on several levels: simple yet captivating prose, memorable characters and scenes, a story that is at once grim, hopeful and oddly whimsical, and a truly unique narrator (Death). It conveys not only the well-known horrors of Nazi Germany but also the many levels of victimhood that dominate all parts of a society at war. The Book Thief should appeal to thoughtful teens as well as adults.
 I will keep this short and sweet. I loved this book; it is rich in history and it took me weeks to get over missing the characters. It is so well written; at no time during the read did I NOT have a perfect visual of where the characters where and what their surroundings looked and felt like.
 Good story about life during that period of this world
 So much missing, a book about words,but not enough of them.  Maybe I was expecting more because there is a movie coming out.  I will be interested to see it and how they are going to fill in the blanks.  This book might have too much hope in the advertising and should only be a three.
 This book is AMAZING!  I can't wait to see the movie and just hope it does the book justice.  I LOVED it.<br/>The book is written from the point of view of Death and it follows a little girl called Liesel as she lives through the war.  It's such a touching story and so well-written.<br/>I will be checking to see the author's other works.
 I love this book.  Even when it's ripping my heart out - and it does rip your heart out.  OK, it's yet another perspective on the Holocaust - but if we ever forget what a horror the Holocaust was, we are doomed.  I recommend this book highly - but keep your Kleenex handy.
 Excellent story; loved it. A different view of the war in Germany during WWII. The movie was very good, too.
 this is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. it is told from "death's" point of view. very well written, great story, interesting characters and each very well developed. I found it totally enjoyable.
 The Book Thief is unlike any book I have ever read.  I found it strange at first. The narrator style of writing from Death's perspective was at first very dark, but ultimately very effective and warm.  I haven't seen the movie yet. I cannot imagine it can measure up to the book.
 Required for school.
 This book is enthralling. Amazingly well written. Although the cover does not imply a female protagonist the book centers around a young girl in Nazi Germany. Although the story is deeply personal to her it has implications that cross language and cultural barriers to impact readers everywhere.
 I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Book Thief! It took me a while to figure out who the actual storyteller was but it definitely kept me interested in reading it! I am so glad to have read this before I go see the film version...I recommend everyone read the book before seeing the movie.
 This is an mazing story that I loved on so many levels.  The stark conditions that surrounded this family for years before and during the war and the child that kept moving somehow and learning with any book or paper she could find in her little town.<br/> The love of a family and the father and daughter and the interaction with the prisoner that they saved by hiding him in their tiny basement.<br/>Kindness, passion and survival and the character of the book thief make this a winner.
 The author switched from first to third person throughout the book. Though "death" was first person, I thought that it was rather undeveloped in relation to the main characters--almost gimmicky. I did expect to learn the fate of Max, but that was not developed in the book. It was an Anne Frank kind of book, without getting as deep into her character. Overall, though, I did enjoy the read and look into a different side of WWII.
 Awesome, riveting, gut wrenching, book... I read it. My wife read it. She was in tears for 24 hours... Well written OBVIOUSLY! I would compare it to The Diary of Anne Frank and Schindlers List. Read it - but first purchase kleenex.
 Loved it!  This is one of those books that I absolutely could not put down.  And even after I finished it, the story stayed with me. This was wonderful storyline, and the narrator made it all the more interesting and unique.  Highly recommended.
 When I first started reading this book, I thought the writing style of the author was peculiar, and sometimes even confusing.  As I got into the book, however, I came to understand the flow of the story, and was drawn into the Book Thief's world through the narrator's eyes.  I cried like a baby all through the last several pages, and to me, that means it was a great book.
 I loved this book. It  made me laugh and cry especially considering the contents, but that's life  and this book certainly showed that.  It  reflected the strength and the weaknesses of the human spirit. It also reminds us of a time we should never forget and hopefully learn from.
 The heroine of the book is a courageous sensitive loving girl who has lost a lot in the war already, but proceeds as an adopted orphan to give love, understanding , and courage to a new family plus a vulnerable Jewish man that they hide for a long time. The narration by "death" adds a new twist to it and keeps a different perspective.
 Wow.  Words almost fail me in reviewing this book. You are allowed to view both sides of the human race that were involved in WWII and the beautiful, tormented relationships that evolved in spite of the tragic circumstances. This was a very good book and I hated to finish it.
 Interesting story told from a unique perspective.  Couldn't recommend this any more strongly to anyone interested in WWII and the fascist scourge that plagued Europe before and during the conflict
 whether you read the book first or see the movie, both are deeply affecting. small differences, of course,but nothing that changes the feel of either. as perfect a book as I have ever read, and I have read a lot. savor this book, laugh,cry,cheer, but do read it.
 Recently made into a movie.  But, there is no comparison between the book and the movie.  You MUST read the book first.  It is one of the dark realities of what war brings to the common person.  Too bad they don't have a 6-star rating.  I'd give it to this one.
 Excellent, yet odd, story of WWII.  Sad, moving and informative.  I would've liked to have known what happened to the main character after the war, the last chapter had me sobbing.
 I really enjoyed this story.  It follows a young girl's life from her Mother leaving to being "adopted" and living during the poor times of World War II.  She is an interesting character.  The point of view that this story is written from is something new and very different.
 This story made the horrors and humanity of WW II come alive. Once I started to read, it was hard to put the book down. The characters spoke for so many who suffered the hardships and sorrows of Nazi Germany, and the love of a father and a friend were so real in the descriptions. Each character displayed their own struggles in vivid words. Death as a narrator made sense in such a sad time and place. I'm sorry the book is finished, since these characters became a part of my circle of friends.
 This beautifully written book is the newest addition to my list of all-time favorites.  The truly unique portrait of "Death" as a character and narrator is brilliantly conceived and the story told delivers powerful emotional truth.  And beyond the power of the story, Zusak's prose is often more like poetry, painting both the physical world and the humans who inhabit it with a unique brush.  It was so beautifully written, I had to repeatedly fight the urge to force other people to read or listen to passages.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves reading not just books, but literature!
 A wonderful book.  It was recommended by a dear friend and now I am looking forward to seeing the movie which she also recommended.  The approach is very novel and the writing exceptional.  I have now recommended it to my daughter and granddaughters.
 Wow. Written from the perspective of the Grim Reaper, this story chronicles the life of a foster child in Hitler's Germany. Strikes at so many of the questions about what would it be like, being an ordinary family, when all your neighbors and friends have been washed away with propaganda. Excellent read.
 I often enjoy reading the book a recently viewed movie was based on (when I don't do it in the opposite order of course).  I only knock off a star because in this case I liked the movie a bit better than the book. Still worth the read.
 I'm not sure what I was expecting but this book is certainly different. I am normally a fast reader but this book is a slow read because you can only read so much without becoming overwhelmed by the subject matter. I'm glad I read it, but honestly I don't think I would read it again nor can I recommend it to others. I would not go to the movie.
 I was hooked from the first few pages. Written in such a way I was right there in the book with them. The wording and descriptions are so vivid, it grabs you and doesn't let go, even when the last page is read. Every emotion is pulled out of you, definitely one of the best books I've ever read. I can't recommend this book higher!!
 Loved it
 This book is narrated by the "grim reaper" or angel of death as I prefer to think. The trials of Nazi Germany through one young girls life. I like a book that accounts accurately on history as this does, even the atrocities. The perspective is of a "German" non Jew/ non Nazi. It is comparable to "Schindler's list" and  "Sophie's choice."
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The imagery and powerfully descriptive writing captivated me to the very last page and I saved quite a few clippings from this ebook. Towards the end, I slowed down, simply because I didn't want it to end. It took a couple of chapters to get into and I wasn't sure this was my sort of book, but if you feel that way after reading the sample, stick with it and read the rest, it's well worth it. I particularly liked how well it portrayed the life of a young girl living in Nazi Germany, without going into too much detail about the horrific things that happened, which would have made it too morbid and depressing. Its one of the few books I've read where the characters had a real impact on me, making the story all the more moving.
 one of the most beautiful stories ever written. SHould be required reading in every class setting. eventhough it was originally written as YA, I found it one of the best books I have ever read
 This book gives an interesting perspective of the holacaust from the eyes of a sympathetic German family and also makes you aware that many of the German people not in the army were very much in favor of Hitler's programs.  It is well written and will keep you wanting to see what happens next.
 I haven't read a WWII book in a couple decades, but couldn't resist trying this one.  It was wonderful!  A heartwrenching, but sometimes funny story with wonderful and inspiring characters.  I couldn't put it down.  If you love the movie, you will love the book ten times over.  You need the WHOLE story!
 Without going into too many of what you'll find in the pages, this book - narrated by Death - is probably one of the best books I've ever read.  Well thought out, flows wonderfully and you can't help but feel the 'heart' in this story. Amazing read and I cannot wait to see the movie...
 I think every high school student should read this book. Well written. Really churns one's emotions. Loved it!!
 From the first page to the last I was drawn deeper into the heartbreak of the war. Not just the physical carnage but the emotional and psychic butchery served up in manageable bites. I laughed, I cried, I felt deeply. These are some of the things an author most dearly hopes to give a reader.
 Oh, to tell a story with so many hearts involved and in such a realistic way. If I could only ask the author why his use of reference to Christ, Mary &amp; Joseph in statements of crisis and not a mention of anyone in prayer...
 At first, I was confused by the narration by the grim-reaper. But as this story unfolded I realized how appropriate it was. A terrible era for humanity, this story flashed a light on the dignity of people during the worst of times. I couldn't put it down!
 I couldn't put this book down.  It is a realistic story in the Hitler era of Germany.  When I start to describe the story, it sounds depressing but it is not.  The author draws you into the life of a young girl and her love of books.  I felt like I was actually living in Germany in the 40s.
 This was such a hard read, but, one that I so wanted to dig into.  I loved the characters, loved them!  I know that I can't fathom the depth of suffering that was endured but, from my window view, I wept with each injustice.  And, yes, I did laugh at Rudy and Liesel's antics.  Suffice to say, what a worthwhile read.
 This novel steals your heart and soul while you gladly relinquish them. The reader will do anything to keep from being denied access to the lives and souls of Liesel and the others. This book will own you and not just for a day or two. If we are lucky, it will own US forever.
 Interesting narrator and the power of the word shaker can be applied to the current political environment.
 This story has all the beauty and nitty-gritty reality of this life. The lyrical writing of Markus Zusak is captivating, and the POV of Death constantly caught me off guard - I was so wrapped up in the story. I would recommend this book to friends of all ages - middle-school to adult.
 Couldn't put this book down.  Not the typical Holocaust novel, this is a fresh take on the circumstances of one girl and the family that takes her in, as well as the neighbors and friends who touch her life in the ghetto.  Once I grasped who the narrator was, it took on a whole new meaning.  The book seems to span many levels of thought and spirituality.  Will try more by this author.
 This book tells a story from the vantage point of a very mysterious entity. Although it is fictional I'm sire it could have been true. It is a story of bravery and conviction which gives those who have lived through such horrors a face, one of humanity and love. I recommend this book.
 At first I was sure if I liked The Book Thief. I thought it odd that the narration was done by Death. By the entire  of the book I could not have imagined it any other way. It would not have been the same or even as great as it truly was. The characters are rich and full. You fall in love with all of them but especially Hans. This is a book that will stay with me for a long time. It was very sad but also very moving. Kindness is more powerful then more know and if I had to put a theme on this book it would be just that. The power of kindness is unfathomable!
 A truly amazing book.  So full of emotions and horrible pictures brought to mind!  There where beautifully<br/>Described moments and characters that I grew to love.  Truly a fantastic adventure with the little girl and Rudy!
 I thought this historical fiction was a wonderful way to get a glimpse of life during WWII from a different perspective.<br/>I couldn't put the book down, and recommended it to my 12 year old daughter, who enjoyed it as much as I. Note, we haven't seen the movie yet but look forward to it.
 This book was a difficult read because of the subject matter but well-worth the time because it's a powerful story. The characters were well drawn and you could almost picture the houses and streets. A definite must read.
 This is one of those books you live inside of while reading it. The author is incredibly creative and clever and inventive. I highly recommend this book.
 One of the best books I have ever read to date.  A haunting tale of a horrific time in history presented with such depth, raw facts, yet real emotion.  Difficult to describe but you are drawn into this era and are pulling for the characters in this story and living their sorrows and joys with them, through the skilled writing of the author.  A must read!!
 This is one of the few books I have read about the average German citizen during World War II. I thought most German's were Nazis.  This book is written from a child's point of view and narrated by the soul gatherer.  I would recommend this book for readers of all ages.
 It took some time for me to really understand what was going on in the beginning of the book. I started over at one point because I wasn't following. Once I understood who the narrator was, it made more sense to me.  I hope the movie is good. I'm anxious to see it now.
 This book gave a unique perspective of World War II, the Hitler regime, and the Holocaust!! Its content was very interesting with a historical resonance that created a high level of sympathy.  Zusak captures the 'fear' of the the residents of the community, the Jewish people, and their accomplices. He addresses the issues and lives of people who were 'forced' (for self-preservation) to support the Hitler regime even though they opposed it.  Very emotionally charged!!
 In the never ending horror of world war 2. This story is a wrenchingly beautiful and horribly sad story. I felt so many emotions reading it that I cannot begin to describe except to say READ THIS BOOK.
 This book was hard to get into but once I got into it, it is very good.  It's sad that the world has to remember wars and all the terrible things we humans do to one another.  I sure hope some day we have a world without war but I don't think this will ever happen.  Read the Book Thief and you will be thankful for all the things you do have.
 From the first chapter, you know this is not going to be an easy, light-hearted read. But you can't put it down and the characters become a part of your waking thoughts. Yet the book leaves you with the hope that evil forces in this world can never destroy our love for one another that gives meaning, purpose and strength to our lives during our darkest hours.
 I enjoyed the story line of this book. However, I personally did not like the writing style of the author. At times I thought it was hard to follow and jumped from one thing to another. I enjoy this type of historical fiction but was a tad disappointed in this book. Overall, it had a great story line with mediocre writing.
 A beautiful book full of detail and compassion. Narrated by Death, the use of color sets mood well. Set in Nazi Germany, the location could as well be Syria,Israel, Sudan. The characters are well -drawn. One sees how even in the midst of propaganda and great evil how the decency of people unswayed by public fervor can still do good, no matter how small it seems at the time of the doing.
 I am about 2/3 of the way through this book and I like it a lot.<br/>Often I have to stop reading until the tears clear from my eyes.<br/>The writing style is different from anything I have read before, he uses the gentle (not the grim) reaper as the narrator for the story..
 I loved this story and how it is told! The characters are all amazing and I fell in love with them all! The way he writes is so originally done with wonderful detail but not too much that you get lost in them! I recommend to all!
 I could not put this book down. I had been told to read this book by numerous people and finally got around to it. I am so pleased I did. Well written, great storyline, character development and narration. Loved it.
 I don't often read fiction because I find so much writing to be either contrived or predictable.  This is just GREAT writing. Many passages can stand on their own with deep meaning even out of context.<br/><br/>Also the story seems to me to be much more about the manner in which things happen rather than just a sequence of events.  He does not often narrate about what the characters are thinking, rather he shows who they are by the many small things they do.<br/><br/>This is a book for adults more than children unless the children are "old". I am going to reread this at some point and get copies for several people. The Book Thief speaks strongly to the power of words to produce good and evil. Anyone interested in writing must read this book.
 Great story
 A most uniquely written story centered on one young girl's life in Nazi Germany just before and during WWII. Narrated by Death, the story is both heartbreaking and beautifully poetic. The many metaphors woven throughout the story are often strange and "other worldly", in keeping with the teller's perspective. Haunting and deeply moving, "The Book Thief" will grab your heart and never let go.
 a great story told from a different perspective on Nazi Germany.  this book is very sad so be forewarned.  it can be choppy at times but the narrator's delivery is fascinating and entertaining.  I think it could have added a little more at the end,I needed more closure.
 I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend.  But I had no idea of the storyline.  Turns out it is set in WW2 during the Holocaust.  It is compelling, hard to put down, but also sad.  The characters are so real and show a different side of German humanity.
 Topic of "average" Germans during WWII, their perception of events including Holocaust through the eyes of orphan girl. Language of the book is very easy to understand without artificially fancy words and phrases. It has enough of reality as well as a bit of mystery. Very skillfully done. I suspect it could be used for really good screenplay as well.
 Great book.
 Loved this book. Kind of slow but I loved the characters. The movie got terrible reviews so I have yet to see it, which is too bad because I had high hopes that the movie would compliment the book. I maybe will rent it someday but I don't want it to ruin the illusion of the characters.
 I'm weary of best sellers because I often have wildly different tastes in literature than most. But this one is as good as all the reviews
 One fantastic emotional ride from start to finish - that is sure to grip your interest and you are capable of emphathy!  Written from the prospective of someone you would never guess (not that it is keep a secret), but especially appropriate for the time period.
 I was somewhat intimidated by the length of the book, but once into it stayed interested. The author's focus on the German children's point of view during the bombings in their city during WWII was a fresh look at a difficult time in history. Using Death as a narrator was unusual, but creative
 I have not finished reading it and I don't want it to end. I love the writer's style and the story. It's so different from other stories about what happened during the nazi regime in Germany. I think it's as good as The Pianist. I haven't finished reading it so I don't want to make an extensive review. I just love it!
 Beauty and a story narrated by Death - not two ideas that you would expect to use in the same phrase - but this is a beautiful story. Sad, desperately sad, but full of insight into the human heart and its capacity for love, loyalty, hatred, bravery, resilience...<br/>(A note to those with poorer eyesight: I read it on my very small Kindle but had to transfer to my iPad for the section that shows the book Max wrote, as it is essentially a series of illustrations and tiny handwritten script and it was too hard to see without using the magnify feature the iPad provides. I may have to buy the actual paper book to fully enjoy that - it is one of the highlights of the story.)
 Thought provoking, well written.  At first it was slightly hard to get into, but once I found the rhythm it was impossible to put down.  I will read it again after I have done some processing of info and some of my own research to fill in the gaps in my knowledge of WWII history.
 I couldn't read this book fast enough.  Even though I knew it would be so sad.  I can't wait for the movie.  as always, I like to read the book first.  I don't want to spoil anything, but the way the story is told is quite unique.  You won't be sorry to read this book.
 This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time, and I read quite a bit.  It is very well written and just draws you in.  You become wrapped up in the characters very quickly and want every thing to work out for them.  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this book.
 This was an extra ordinary, thought provoking, emotional reading book.  The idea that Death was narrating gave a different perspective and actually gave the reader an outside view of the individuals.  I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to seeing the movie.
 It made me smile; it made me laugh; it made me sad; it made me cry.  A sad reminder of man's ability to be evil, as well as our ability to be selfless and kind. Lovely characters that suck you in. Very enjoyable read for all ages.
 Although this book is somewhat difficult to get into once you have been hooked, it is quite remarkable.  The viewpoint is different from any I have ever read on the subject.  I think The Book Thief will become a classic.  It makes one think and feel and brought me to tears.
 The "Book Thief" is written as if an observer were describing the action. It is different, but extremely effective. I was captivated from the first page. Seeing WW2 from the eyes of a German girl puts a whole new slant on history. A wonderful, satisfying story.
 At first I was having trouble reading this book due to the way the author broke things up, but once I started, I did not want to put it down!! I had seen a preview for the movie a while back and this book had been in the back of my mind to read and I finally got it and loved it.  The way he would describe the thoughts of "Death" or the Grim Reaper was fantastic...I could see exactly what he was describing.
 What a wonderful book - dark, suspenseful and absolutely terrific story.  Written in an unusual manner but I couldn't put it down!
 I liked the story line of this book and when I learned it was being made into a movie, I decided to read it.<br/>But I'm really disappointed with the slow pace - ages before I figured out what this book is really all about along with whose who.<br/>I'm not sure Ill finish it
 Really enjoyed the books characters and the points of views it was told from...sad fictional history of events!
 I loved reading this book.  It was a great story from an interesting perspective.  I strongly recommend it.
 Good story although written a bit weird until I got into it then it makes sense (don't want to spoil it for anyone).  The best parts for me were the stories written by the hidden man.  Overall I would recommend.  Very sad though but to be expected for the subject matter!
 I bought this before I realized it was a movie but read it after I had seen the movie so I had faces to put with the main characters.  The movie pretty much followed the text of the story so there was no problem in reading the book after.  It is a hard to put down story.
 Yes, this is a good story and a worthwhile read.  However, the main reason why I gave this five stars is because it is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read.
 The Book Thief by Marcus Susan was a wonderful novel narrated by Death.<br/>Most everyone knows the history of World War II, but Mr.Susan b r ought the era to life with the best writing I have read in twenty-five years!!!
 No book about WWII Germany has tugged at my heart strings as much as The Book Thief.  Loved the idea that it was a narrative from Death and think that may be why the book was able to extract such emotion from the reader.  I never sobbed so hard during a book.  I recommend reading this book again and again.
 I won’t ever be able to forget Liesel and her family.  One of the best books I’ve ever read.  A great historical fiction work.
 I couldn't put the book down. I saw the movie first and was curious as to what else was in the story. The answer was "A lot". The movie was very true to the book, and now I must see it again. I will recommend this book to anyone.
 This story was beautiful, touching, and moving.  The writing itself is 5 stars.  So why the 3 stars?  Because it was so sad and therefore so hard to read for me personally!  i would recommend this story to anyone but with the disclaimer to make sure to have a box of tissues close by.
 Very good read.
 I enjoyed this book and the unique presentation of a very difficult subject and time in history.  The perspective is surprising and for some may be unsettling.  Not great literature but a very good read.
 I LOVED this book. From page one I did not want to put it down. The characters are true , living each day in Nazi Germany ,seeing all the trials in the families and trying to stay true to their moral code. Thru the words you are there with them. This is one book I will read again.
 The Book Thief is a very tender story about a horrific time.  Instead of dwelling on the Holocaust, the author touched the human damage experienced by a survivor.  The characters were well developed and I felt that I had lived their experiences too.  As a reader, I have withdrawn into my books during difficult times so I could appreciate the solace and strength that it gave this young girl
 Amazing story about survival, humanity, greed and love! There are many books about Second World War and holocaust but this one I could not put down. I loved the fact that Death is the main narrator with a bit of human in it! Strongly recommend but a word of warning: this book will leave you in tears!
 THis is one of the better books I read this summer. I would classify it in-between a light summer read and more serious literature. I enjoyed the use of colors to convey emotion of the moment (usually historical). Considering the historical setting, I don't foresee any better ending. Great read.
 I'm a book worm.  I think this is my favorite book ever.  I can't put it down.  What a story!!!!  If you read Monuments Men you MUST read this one too.  Awesome story telling, you feel like you are right there in Germany during the War.
 This is a wonderful, imaginative book told from the perspective of a ten year old German girl in 1939. The characters are beautifully drawn, and the writing is first rate.
 This was one of 2 books I think are the best I've read.  Although I didn't see the movie, and understand that it was wonderful.  I first read this on my Kindle, and then had to buy a hard copy!
 Very thought provoking and definitely a different book into WWII and how a young girl helped save and hide a Jew during this terrible time in history.  This book has been made into a movie and that is always a clue to me that  it is worth a read!
 I loved this book. though it was a tragic story of a tragic time, the narrative was beautiful. I particularly like the fact that it was  the voice of the reaper throughout. perhaps that helped to keep a safe  distance between me and the characters whose lives were being shattered.
 The fictional story helped me 'walk a mile' in the shoes of working class people in a small German town in Nazi Germany.  Putting Death in the role of narrator was an interesting literary device that faded In and out of perspective.  I would highly recommend this book.
 I wanted to read this book before I saw the movie.  At first, I wasn't sure if I liked it.  The more I read, the More intrigued I got.  It is a good insight to the lives of someone living during such a terrible time.  The persecution of the Jews and how the people had to live in this world.  I am anxiously awaiting the movie.
 At times the book is difficult to read, and at times the words fly from the pages.  Every emotion, love and hate, fear and comfort, happiness and sadness are dealt with in this book.  Ultimately, the ending leaves the reader short of breathe, because to breathe would be to grieve.
 This book is written from the  perspective you don't ever consider. I will recommend this to all I meet, and to my 6th grade grandson. It's about humanity an  the lessons learned from one  of<br/>  the darkest chapters in history. Bravo Mr. Zusak.
 Excellent story.  I have always had a fascination for the lives of people during World War II.  Love how this book takes the viewpoint of a young German girl and her world.  Truly an eye opener and heart wrenching.  Just wish that it's plot wasn't based on actual history.  So sad what the European people at that time endured.  Enjoyed the narrator's viewpoint.  Was an excellent read, and excited to see the movie.
 "The Book Thief" is one of the most beautifully written books I have read in a while.  A friend had been urging me to read it but I did so only recently when it was selected by my book club.  This wonderful book generated a lot of deep discussion as it works on so many levels - war, family, good and evil, love, and more, much more.  And then there is the absolute poetry, the music, of the writing.  If you have not read this yet, please do.  You will not regret it.
 The best book I have read in ages. So beautifully written, I didn't want it to end. I suspect the Book Thief will stay with me forever.
 This is one of the most remarkable and haunting books I have ever read.  At times I couldn't put it down and other times I had to put it down.  The book takes place during WW II in Hitler's Germany but it is so much more than a war novel.  The characters are fascinating and usually very developed.  The narator of the book is "Death" yet it isn't a horror story in the traditional sense.  Anyone who loves historical novels that make you think about the human condition will want to read this book.  It is suggested as a book for teenagers, and is appropriate for mature teenagers, but adults will want to read it as well.
 Loved this book
 I read this book at the request of my 14 year old daughter who had already read it at school. I have read many stories about WWII in the past, but none that I can remember affecting me so stongly. We often forget the effect the war had on the German people both Jewish and non-Jewish. This story as told by death, shows both of those sides. He tells how many of the German people were forced to do things they did not believe in just to survive themselves and how many risked their own lives to save others. This is a must read.
 A truly absorbing book. Its unusual narration ends up as a strength which allows a strange series of 'impartial' insights which strengthen the narration. It had the potential to cheapen and trivialise the story but showed itself to be a strength. It is unusual to find a book set in Nazi Germany that does not become a Hollywood benediction to the Israeli world view, it is therefore refreshing to find a book that deals with such horrors without the tinsel and gloss of the Palestinian's oppressors taking center stage.  A Great Read.
 A very entertaining story written in a totally unusual way which made the book even more interesting. Based in Germany during the war years, it is also good to see a perspective from the 'enemy side' though really not an enemy at all, but a family, a neighborhood a village affected buy an unjust and foreign element..war. And the people like those from any community, who go about life in a compassionate and warming way bringing their strong characters to the fore. Much better than the film.
 <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/The-Book-Thief/dp/0375842209/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Book Thief</a><br/><br/>For some reason this marvelous and compelling work of fiction is labeled as Young Adult.  The topic certainly isn't, as the other books of Zusak are.  It takes a few pages to get into the author's style, but after you arrive, the journey and characters are unforgettable.  I have recommended this book to everyone who has ears.
 Mere words explain the tragic events to a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany near Dachau.  The story has some similarities to The Diary of Anne Frank.  Don't forget to see the movie of this heart-warming tale.
 Bought this book but kept putting off reading it.  Wow when i started i could not stop; now that i finished i wanted it to go on, that's how much i loved it. Great book, wonderful story. If you have not yet read please do.
 I found this book to be riveting.  Although it is heart rendering and sometimes most difficult to "live" thru - it still became  one of those books that I could not put down.  Definitely not for the faint of heart but certainly a have to remember what happened and what could happen again.
 As I am from the era of the 2nd world war ( I was 7 when it started and 11 when it ended) I could still remember lots of things that happened. Being the same faith as the young man they hid, I recall the anguish that my family had during those years. It was beautifully written and of course lots of tears to my eyes at the end of the book. I will re-read it because I want to be sure I did not miss a word.
 Help! I did not mean to order Kindle edition! What can I do to cancel my order?
 Writing style is pretty quirky, but over all it was a fascinating depiction of life under the Nazis.  Heart breaking, but a glimpse of what people need to resort to just to survive. One is likely to ask if 21st C Americans could be as ingenious and gutsy as the characters in the novel.
 Well written about Germans and Jews in Germany during  World War II from a prospective that I have not experienced before. It is that of the "every day German". It presents humans at neither their worst or best, but in that human, grey area full of faults.
 I loved this story! It was the story of youth enduring hardship and the naivety that can go along with that. It was written by the Angel of Death, which was a twist. The character development was great which is something I value. This book is easily recommended to all!!
 Depicts the evils and wastes of war with scattered pieces of caring humanity.
 Drew me in with characters that were alive and real  I grew to love all of them and with a heavy heart I must let them go but it will take awhile before this will happen and I will never forget anyone or their stories.  I will put this book in the top shelf of books that change me.
 This was a book being read and discussed by a book club in a nearby library. I saw the notice and thought the title was interesting. When I read the blurb, I knew I had to read the book.  Having read much about WWII--both fiction and nonfiction--I must say that few books have touched me so profoundly as The Book Thief. The unusual perspective of the narrator is very effective as is the unfolding of events as they affected a little German girl, her family, and her peers in a small German town. An excellent book!
 A personal view of a family in WWII Germany through the eyes of a young girl. The insights provided as she grows up show us the daily struggles of the war years. We see what true goodness looks like though the actions of her father, Hans. We cry for Max and his struggle as a Jew in Germany and his need to hide. We grow up with Liesel and treasure her "Book Thief" experiences.
 Very good, but sad as well. Full of adventure and laughter. Would definitely recommend to probably ages ten and up, it just depends on how much they can handle.
 Great book &amp; Great Quality
 I was a little leery at first, but this book kept me reading and wanting to keep getting back to it each time I put it down. The characters in the book are fabulous, and the ending of the book is one of the most heart-rendering tales I've ever seen with my mind's eye.
 well written and a good read the author is very good at keeping your interest throughout the book
 saw the movie that inspired me to read the book - the book is very readable narrated by 'death" which sounds weird but isn't - it makes the book flow together - highly recommend - fast and accurate service
 I can't understand why the storyteeler mentioned the sad ending FIRST, and then told the story. One can't help but see the life with a sense of doom from the beginning.  The inside out description of things was very pleasant, overall I don't consider this book a must read.
 A dreadful tale of unspeakable suffering told with lightness and clarity that is absolutely riveting.  I hope they don't screw up the movie with morbidity that ruins the unique perspective of the book's narrator.
 Incredible character development, refreshing to see Nazi Germany from the German perspective.  Plot was a little hard to follow at times. Not a "feel good" book, but definitely an important one. Love the juxtaposition of war time events with daily life.
 This is a very good read with a good ending for the most part. There was some sadness toward the end, but this was history though embellished somewhat. The narrator was different and helped to hold one's interest. Different, but delightful. My wife is reading the book now.
 I will admit that it took a little while to understand the narrator at the beginning of the book.  But after getting in the flow of the book, it was hard to put down.  Keep an open mind to the perspective as sometimes it seems sympathetic to Hitler. However, I don't believe that it is.  It helped me understand how horrible war is for everyone. Definitely war should be avoided if possible.  That is why the "Hitler's" should be stopped before they gain traction.
 This book is so much better then the movie. I saw the movie first and had a lot of questions. The book answered most of my questions. That is the biggest party of the book I liked. It is a tear jerker. I would recommend it to anybody who has the patience to read a book like this.
 Though this is listed as a Young Adult book, I think it would take a serious young adult to enjoy it.  It was a riveting story, yet easy to read and follow the plot.  I would recommend it to anyone who has some knowledge of the WWII era and understanding of the German life at that time.
 I enjoyed this book even though subject is awful.
 A great view inside WW II time Germany. A story that shows the suffering of the average Germans and their fright of the Nazi regime. A family risking their lives to save a jew. 10X better to read the book then watch the movie.
 What a wonderful book.  I loved the style in which it was written.  I couldn't get enough and I hated to see the book end.  A pleasant surprise, a book mentioned in "The Book Thief" was a book that was actually written which I am enjoying now.
 Thanks
 I loved this book, it is very soulful, emotional, insightful and yet so real. The author has a wonderful understanding of human nature. I find it hard to describe how much this book affected me, I have since read two more of this authors books and he continues to surprise and delight me.
 A beautiful and compelling narrative set against WW II in Nazi Germany. The narrator is engaging, sympathetic, and . . an omniscient abstraction. The characters are lovable and achingly lovely despite the squalor of their surroundings. And the tale is an absorbing page turner that will have you, like the book thief, sacrificing sleep to read.  Highly recommended.
 Broken, beautiful, colorful but always shaded in gray.  It was seeing Nazi Germany through new eyes.  I sobbed at the end but not because of the sadness, more because of the profoundness.  I didn't sleep.  This book will be on my mind for a very long time.  Wonderful, wonderful story.
 I'am not really sure how I feel about this book! Death comes to all of us, but it seems strange to have it tell you a story. It took a while to get through this book, wanted to see what it was all about. Still not sure how I feel so a 4 is for that reason.
 Imagine, if you can, a story narrated by Death in the heart of Nazi Germany.  Imagine what Death sees as he watches one small German foster child, a girl, who loses her mother and her brother.  Then watch her as the war rages on and her life becomes harder and harder and yet easier and easier as it fills with words and love.  But as Death will let us know, don't count on things getting better forever.  It can get worse.  And it does.  And it can get even worse after that.<br/>JW
 Amazingly written book.  I love this book!!!
 Amazing story. Great characters. Love WWII Germany/Nazi historic stories.
 This is an excellent read for the price.  There were times I felt it was lengthy but the read was worth it.  I went to see the movie when it came out and was disappointed because the book is much better (as always).  It is appropriate for younger readers.  You will fall in love with the characters...such a touching story!
 I would never thought this book would be so good when I saw the cover. This was a great book that taught me a lot about brutality and being brain washed and all kinds of stuff. I am a teenager and I liked this book so I think it is good for children and especially adults.
 The word selection and word combinations are some of the best that I've read (they just make things so vivid and the reading experience rich); however, I would say the author is an outstanding writer but not as good a  novelist.
 Extraordinary and truly amazing book.  The writing is superb and the point of view I find fascinating and surprising.  I'm looking forward to seeing the film once finished with the book.  Markus Zusak is a gifted, creative writer and I feel that this book will be among those that are considered great literature far into the future!
 This is a terrific book and movie! We saw it in the theatre, and own a copy. This one was purchased for a friend! Highly recommend this!!
 One of my fav books
 A lovely book, well written.  Easy read, hard to put down. Would recommend to anyone, young or old.  Am suggesting it to my teen daughters.  Tastefully done on sensative subject!  'What would I do?' type of story.
 This book is right out of the time that my mom and dad went true the war in Holland I like to read anything that has to do with worldwar 2 in Europe, this is the first book I read about what people in Germany went true, I can't wait to see the movie.
 Great book! The narrator's point of view keeps it interesting. The suspense was killing new during the whole book n even when there was foreshadowing. It definitely reminds you that there were two Germanys' back during the Holocaust not just the tyrannical Nazi Germany. I loved every minute of it!!
 OH MY GOSH. I will read probably 50 - 60 books this year. It is going to be tough to top this one. Oh yes, I have read the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns is on my nightstand right now. I have read Water for Elephants...I have read Shadows of the Wind. All excellent. Any time a book can make you smile and snicker and then fill you with sadness or grief...anytime a book can stir emotions like this one did me...I rate it five stars with no problem. This book takes place in Nazi Germany during the war. Rudy and Liesel are the young protaganists. Nuff said...buy this book...it will blow you away. BTW...I am a 59 year old male reader. Enjoy.
 First read the book then saw the movie...glad I read the book first which contained much more detail.  Excellent reading but kinda depressing reading how the Jews were persecuted.  We tend to forget much of our history and this was a reminder of these happenings.
 Hands down, one of the best book I've read. Captivating, Exciting, Well written, I just couldn't put the book down. And when I finished it, first thing I did was checking whether they are going to make a movie for it. And yes they are working on it now - can't wait!<br/>One thing I really love about this book, besides the interesting choice of narrator (death), superb story line, and great character development, is the fact that the story is 'complete'. My pet hate is spending some time reading a book, and in the end, my imagination is left hanging to wonder what happens with the characters. With this book, it tells me exactly how each character ends up to be. I finished reading the book feeling satisfied.
 I did not find Mr. Zusak's writing rhythm until page 100.  I could see Liesel and her family/friends.  There were moments when I lost the rhythm, but overall, this is a good book.
 The Book Thief is one of the best literary works i have read. It is captivating; light-hearted and amusing in some parts, poignant in most. It is beautifully and sensitively written; the language is poetic. It is unique! If you saw the film and loved it, please know that you received a frightfully small portion of what the author had to say. How refreshing to read such a well-written book without any profanity (the mild German expletives don't count!) or obscenity and vulgarity that pollutes so much modern literature.
 One of the best books I read recently. As a second generation to the Holocaust I immersed myself in the story and the various characters. What added to the uniqueness of this book is the special way of Zusak's writing the narrator is Death and therefor we are looking on the happenings from a higher viewpoint and it gives a very strong effect on the reader.<br/>I couldn't stop thinking about the book and especially Liesel and her foster parents long after finishing it.
 In the beginning I was distracted by the way in which the story went from a story to the bold print but the more I read the more I got used to the switches.  What an incredible story!  It's well written and I enjoyed it so much!  If you give it even half a chance you will too!  Be prepared for a wonderful adventure!
 This book was a bit difficult to get into but soon became an enthralling story. Absolutely worth reading, especially in a time when the younger generations seem to be ignorant of what happened during the Holocaust. A gritty, new perspective of an important time in history.
 I  found this novel to be beautifully written, great novel that had facts many of  us need to hear, and the first page turner I have read i n a long ti me.  Problem is -  I am not a teen and makes me wonder how many teens would love it as much as an adult.
 What can I say that has not already been said before. Nice read good insight into of what the normal German citizens were living through during a horrible period in history, I think it would be a good teaching tool for middle schoolers to read along with Anne Frank
 I really enjoyed this book.  This shows horrible like was during WWII and how much books could take away a small portion of the sadness that people and children had to endure.  I can see why a movie is being made of this book.
 This book is beautifully written. There is a very appealing quirkiness to the writing. There are delightful surprises of association in the descriptions, like "All was dark-skied and hazy, and small chips of rain were starting to fall", and "the moon was sewn into the sky that night.  Clouds were stitched around it." The story is very moving.
 The author has has reinvented the adjective.  His side of language is spare and perfect.  This is the third time I have read read it and still believe that if I had ever been able to write a book, I would have wished to have written this one.  And I think I would have been complete.
 Zusak paints extraordinary pictures, which is a gross understatement. Creating the setting in Germany with common people suffering through the horrors of WWII, gives a different viewpoint of its madness. Making the narrator Death was a stroke of genius. I hate Holocaust and war books, but I couldn't put this down. The writing is incredible.
 The Book Thief was a good read.  I've read several books on the holocaust, but this one is being told by "death"!  Very interesting.  The author did pay special attention to the characters, making them feel real.  Never boring.  Glad I read it!
 This book was full of sadness and success over evil.  The ;characters were alive to me.  I felt that I was a part of the story.  It remains hard to understand how horrible people can be to each other.  The "book thief" gave courage to me and I'm sure everyone who reeds this.  Yes, I cried, but felt honored to be reading this strong, sad but hope filled story,.
 Now this was a fascinating book.  It was so incredible, I would wake up in the middle of the night to continue reading it.  It was difficult to understand at the beginning, but I continued onward only to become totally engrossed.  What a beautiful story.
 good
 Great read. Gets you into the hearts of the Germans and their children during WWII and how they were also victims. I sa the movie while I was half way through the book. Instead of ruining the book, it made it better because I could imagin what the people looked liked. Of course the book added so many more details. I love books that tell a great story, and also gives a whole new in site into history.
 I couldn't put this book down even though I had read it some time ago. I would recommend it to older teens and adults.  Because it is set in Nazi Germany you know it is not going to be a happy-ever-after book but I loved reading it from a German point of view. My only criticism would be some of the language--here the words do get in the way.
 The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is a small story, about a small girl, some words, an accordionist, some Germans, a Jewish fist-fighter, and a lot of thievery. Liesel is a foster girl living outside of Munich during WWII. Liesel loves books she cannot resist them when she encounters a house with a library she cannot help but steal them. Her foster father teaches her how to read. She reads and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well as with the Jewish man that is hidden in her basement before he is taken to Dachau.<br/><br/>I recommend this book to young adults.<br/><br/>I had a hard time deciding if I liked this book. I have always enjoyed reading about the holocaust era, I am not sure why. Ever since I read a diary of Ann Frank at a very young age I have been captivated by other writing that takes place during that time. I know these books tend to be depressing but I really enjoy them. A book reviewer said it best, if you are looking for a happy ending, this book is not for you, but if you love to read and fall in love with characters and have your heart broken and mended on the same page then read this book. The book had a strange narrator. To be honest it confused me a lot, I ended the book still not really understanding who was narrating and how he knew so much about the main characters. Thanks to other book reviewers I learned who he was. It may count as a book spoiler so I will not say who it is here but it all makes sense to me.<br/><br/>I could get lost in the authors writing, he is very talented. HIs sentences turn into poetry even while the Nazi’s are around everywhere. I think the challenging part for me was seeing the big picture. It was like I was reading a lot of short stories and I didn’t know how to put them all together to figure out what the author was trying to say. To be honest I found myself frustrated when I finished this book and went to read other peoples reviews. They praised this book so high and I felt like I missed something. I still don’t know why I couldn’t grasp this one. Maybe the movie will help. I hope to see it soon and I hope to understand everything better afterwards.<br/><br/>I rate this book a 3 out of 4 stars.
 I had a hard time getting absorbed into the story at first but eventually I was there and didn't want to leave. The characters are rich and wonderfully developed. I recommend this to anyone. Young or old. It needs to be read. Also consider the audible version, excellent narration!
 This book is mistakenly classified as one for teens and even younger. because of the age of the protagonist.  However, only mature and experienced readers can truly understand and absorb its story development and life lessons.  You need to read it slowly, think about what you have read, apply it to your life and move on.
 Simply brilliant. I thought of A River Runs Thought It  while reading this book.  There is something about the narration and the love of words that ties the two together in my mind's eye.
 This book was the most confusing and delightful read.<br/>I am so embarrassed to Not know what a horrible horrendous life for all,certainly for the Jewish people and for the Germans. How did the people let Hitler do it ....<br/>WORDS,WORDS WORDS.<br/>Karenbgood
 "The Book Thief" was such a heartbreaking story but so moving nonetheless. I do not have the words to describe how this book touched my heart. I shed so, so many tears. My Heart breaks for Liesel Meminger. I leave this story changed in so many nameless way. Read this book, you'll understand. Wow.
 I think this is the first time I have given  a  5 star rating- the story touched every fiber of my existence- a must read.
 I cannot say enough about this author!  The Book Thief is so well written you feel as if you are there. Between laughing and crying my emotions were all over the place. I can list this as the best book I have read in quite a while and I will be following Markus Zusak.
 Subject matter aside, this is one of the most beautiful books I've ever read.  I was captured immediately by the writing skill of the author and swept up by a moving story that I couldn't stop reading until it was done. Bravo to Markus and I look forward to his next tale.
 I thought this was a great book.  I was impressed by all of the different characters in the book and how the author was able to tie them all into the story so well.  I had a hard time putting this one down.
 Good book.  It ended up being more of a sad WWII story than I really expected, but I would definitely recommend it!
 Probably the best book available today.  Fantastic characters embroiled in a heart wrenching plot. I wouldn't change a word of it, it's that great.
 The most common perspective of WWII and its impact is how cities, business and some people reacted.  Never have I thought of Death as a character, much less a narrator.  I never thought Death would have a heart.  I loved this book.  I will buy the hard copy.
 This is a good book.  It took a while to get into it but after about half way it was very good.  I have read a lot of better books but I would also read another by this author.  It wasn't bad, it just dragged on a bit at first &amp; too repetitious.
 the ability of the author to describe the events of the past and how they impacted on a child has not previously been explored (according to my recollection).  The boy in the pyjamas came close but took an entirely different approach.  Leisel was abandoned by her mother and left in the care of strangers.  How these strangers loved her and cared for her and the relationship between Leisel and her papa is extraordinary.
 In this book Zusak has demonstrated the most remarkable use of simile and metaphor that I've ever read in the English language. Please don't be put off by the Introduction where he explains that the narrator is The Grim Reaper, as I almost was. I adored Rose body like a wardrobe and her husband Hans' eyes which were so steely metallic that they clanked when he blinked!
 I gave this book 5 stars because I thought the book was exceptionally well written.  The characters were believable, and interwoven in a way that makes us understand the complexities of human existence.  The book keeps your interest throughout and dealt with the very difficult subject of war and holocaust in a realistic way.
 This book really had a way of making me want to know what would happen next. I thought the author's choice of narrator was brilliant. Some of his thoughts  wewe profound.
 I have been to Germany and it looks like the description in the book. Some of it is so beautiful and other parts looked like just after a war. It was such a heart warming and heart breaking story about a true event that forever changed the world.
 I have recommended this book to friends and family, even some people I didn't know. The way this book is written is fantastic.  The author really makes you start thinking. I love the symbols and the story. The book takes place in WW2, so it is depressing (sorry if that spoiled it for anyone), but I think everyone should read it. The message and the characters are unforgettable.
 This was a very interesting read. I enjoyed the narrative of death and how he sympathizes with the souls he takes.
 This is a heart touching of a part of world history told through the eyes of one who endured one of the darkest times in world history.  It is in the end a story of triumph against all odds.  I enjoyed the book though at times it was a slow read.  It leaves a lasting impression.
 For those of you that are trying to decide whether or not you want to read this book, I urge you with my whole heart to allow yourself this. This book is both beautiful and ugly and you will find yourself being happy, sad and angry. But if you are like me you will be so glad you said yes to this book.
 Probably one of the best novels I've read in a LONG time.<br/><br/>The pages are filled with haunting, literate prose.  The book Thief tackles what goes on in the lives of everyday of German citizens during the Nazi plague.  The girl is a smart, smartly written protagonist.
 Usually I read the book before I see the movie, but in this case the reverse was true. I found the videos helpful when the movie strayed from the book.  I believe this book was intended for younger audience, but I highly recommend it to anyone who has a love of books.
 Absolutely loved it!  The Jews suffered so much at the hands of the Germans but, a lot of the German people tried to help in any way they could.  Good read!  I would recommend it and have already to my friends!!!
 It is beautifully written.  It tells a great deal more than the movie could show.  We experienced the war from our side.  The book makes readers experience the pain that Hitler brought onto his own people.  I highly recommend both reading the book and seeing the movie.
 I want to see this movie...but lime  i tell my kids, FIRST you must read the book. And I'm so happy I did read it. I couldn't put it down...hence my review title. I spent many tiresome mornings thinking about the chapters I'd read the night before. The way the narrator pulls you in and makes you want to just. Keep. Reading. I don't typically remember books I read for long, but this one will stay with me for a long, long time. The characters are so vividly described, however indirectly.I found myself there - on Himmel Street, in  the basement...this story was beautiful, tragic, haunting and satisfying. Highly recommended
 I was very excited to get this book, as I am an avid reader. Once I pick up a book I usually can't put it down,  I find myself reading a bit of it every 3 days or so.  I'm happy with the purchase, but maybe it's just not my style of reading.  I also bought the same book for my Dad for his birthday....he finished it in 2 days!
 Five stars for one of the most intriguing, heartfelt stories of the Great War I've had the good fortune to read. The author's use of detailed and rich metaphor, combined with hauntingly detailed accounts of life and strife in wartime Germany, spins an eloquently written, poignant and tragic tale. Soulful narrative is provided by the third person Reaper, mingling sensitive humor with a deep respect for the war's victims and survivors alike.<br/>Recommended for the masses, this provocative story is certain to endure.
 I am speechless, first I hear from my 15 year old granddaughter that it is her favorite book. Then the same refrain from my daughter and then a close friend professor who is in a well worn  book club. I was intrigued, I wasn't disappointed, but I kept saying, it just can't be THAT good. But it is; read it.
 I admit, I got attached to all the characters of this book. so reading, knowing the context of WWII was difficult for me especially when she learns the status of Jews and the air bombs.<br/>It was refreshing to have a book with a simple but good plot. Also, I like that the ending has an emotional twist that I wasn't expecting but it made for the ending.
 To me, the book was troubling, but with Death being the narrator and Nazi Germany during WWII as the setting other  readers will no doubt feel the same. The running theme of extraordinary kindness being juxtaposed with unthinkable evil was meaningful on several levels. My favorite character, Rudy, made me laugh as I read the book, and his escapades continue to flash through my brain at unexpected times.<br/><br/>The target audience is probably high school and above because of the language and topics, but I was wishing younger students could vicariously experience the historical aspects and the perspective of the more average German of the time.
 Author's writing style is different, but interesting and effective.  The story is a page turner.  The narrator is "Death" and it gives a very detailed, and often very sad, insight into the difficult life, emotions, and differing points of view in Germany during World War II.  Above all, it expresses the kindness inherent in most people.  It teaches a good lesson for those of us who have way too much of everything.
 This excellent book reveals the consequences of a population stripped of the ability to think criticality. The propaganda campaign that destroyed the lives chronicled in this novel could seduce us again.
 There is no other word for this story.  It is simply extraordinary.  I have never before read a book that was narrated by an angel whose job it was to collect souls.  Particularly in Germany during World War 2.  What an incredibly rich read. Thank you.
 To write this story from the perspective of the Angel of Death is to lead the reader into a new perspective of war, the cruelties of Hitler and their effect on Germans and Hews alike. The descriptions constantly etch the scenes with grappling turns of phrases.<br/>Don't bother with the movie; just a Dusney version of this reality.
 This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I am 68 and have read many books on many different subjects.  One of my friends is a Holocaust survivor.  The style is unique--having DEATH narrate the story was genius.
 This book is popular for a reason. It's an excellent read.
 I. just finished ready "The Book Thief" and I was completely captivated. The story held my interest from beginning to the end. The characters were well developed and interesting. Hans, Rosa, andRudy came alive for me.  But the real deal was  Liesel Meminger, The Book Thief.  I don't want to go into detail because I want to recommend this book to everyone.
 I loved everything about this book. I couldn't put it down. I'm glad my sister-in-law recommended it to me.
 I think to say I" enjoyed" this book would be a poor choice of words...it was well written, just a very difficult subject to handle.  The author did a remarkable and original job using "death" as the narrator and although this time frame in history is difficult to read about, this book did a great job of taking me into the hearts, minds and lives of what could have been many people living during this horrific era.
 The story is good but I don't think it was told well. It seemed so disjointed and weird at first that I had to really force myself to keep reading. I kept asking, "what the heck???" I only wanted to read it because the movie looks good. I was going to have my daughter read it to learn about what happened and although she's an avid reader, I knew she'd never stay with this. I can't believe I actually finished this book because of the strange, disjointed style.<br/><br/>Also, some things weren't tied up for me in the end and I really hate that. What happened to the brother? Did I miss that?<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to someone with lice because all you do is scratch and scratch and scratch your head. I almost felt like I was at a bar (I don't drink) riding one of those mechanical bulls that you desperately try to stay on while the bull desperately tries to flip you off. That's what it felt like this author was doing - trying to get rid of me.
 I'll admit, I don't read novels often, but if you want true and pure storytelling at it's most creative and most surprising, than get this book- fast. Even if only to gain a new respect for words.<br/><br/>There are moments where you just want to drop the book and hug Liesel, the eponymous protagonist. There are other passages that are so beautiful, so philosophical, that you cannot but stop and think. And finally, there will be moments where you will feel your emotions do things you never thought possible.<br/><br/>This book is something else, entirely. I never knew words could do this.<br/><br/>And you will learn too, with Liesel.<br/><br/>An astonishing, near-perfect classic.
 A powerful thought provoking book. It will make you laugh and cry and hopefully have a better understanding of life for everyday people under Hitler’s Germany.
 Great book!  So heart breaking but also a beautiful story. I truly enjoyed it.
 Written on a true story, which spans Hitler's rule, and life in a German village, with a lovely pa and his potty mouth wife.  Not being able to read or write, life was hard for Lisel, especially at school.  The writing is unusual, and it took me a while to get used to it.
 I liked the general theme of the book that words are a very important.  They can make you feel warm, secure, loved, etc.  I was born during WWII and of German descent and I often wonder what it really was like living during that time for the people of Germany that were not Jews.
 this was a very good book but the timeline wasn't a straight line so I would get confused at times what already happened and what was still to happen. otherwise it was very good and insightful and I definitely recommend it
 I really enjoy stories about the 2nd world war and the manner in which the story was told was very different with Death's perspective Liesel was such a sweetheart girl and so strong.  I throughly enjoyed it.
 This is a great book.  Really well written.  So much better than the movie inspired by it.
 I purchased this book among a multitude of others for my teenage daughter, this one out of the bunch however, is her favorite. The plot of this story is very engaging, but be warned, this book is a tear jerker. Definitely deserves to one day be a classic novel.
 I will remember this book for a long time. I've read many books related to the Holocaust ... This is one of the best. Although it's appropriate for all ages, I think having some historical background will make the story better.
 Very good condition and is held together nicely and is really nice
 It took me awhile to make my way through this book. It has nine or ten parts, it's interesting and engaging and sometimes long and seemingly pointless. But the point of the story was to share the heart break and knowledge of World War II, so perhaps as humans we won't repeat such an atrocity again.
 This is a story  of the effects of a war on the regular people of Germany and how it effected them.  It was hard to get into the book at first because of the lists at the beginning of each section. But by the end of the sample I was hooked.
 good book！
 Great book.<br/>Liesel took me on a journey of a little part of her life. Very sad at times but also uplifting how she handled all the bad things that happened to her.<br/>I don't want to give away anything. It's an easy read and definitely would recommend the book for teens and of course adults too.<br/>Good read
 I had read so many wonderful reviews about this book, but then I read it myself and was disappointed.  I guess it wasn't what I expected it to be and parts of it were slow reading.  Maybe the movie is better?
 Loved this book.  So glad it was chosen for my book club to read.  Will recommend to others to read.
 Loved this book!  I could have kept reading had it been twice as long.  A quick read.  Having Death as a narrator is so unique and it was interesting to hear a WWII/Holocaust-related story that focuses on non-Nazi Germans during that time, for a slightly different perspective.
 Favorite book of all time
 This is a haunting book--one that you keep thinking of even after it's read.  Keeps you on your toes with the timeline that switches around.  With the character he chose to narrate the story, you get an interesting perspective.  Quite a flair for the narrative.
 This book stole my heart away and wrapped itself around my brain until i was unable to get through my day without thinking about it and grabbing it when i was supposed to be doing something else.  it is an amazing story, told in an original way.  having death tell the story, but having death not be threatening, only observant, was an amazingly different point of view.  the summarizations, the drawings, the poems, the quotations, the characters, ---- the story.  this is a book that should be read by all who love literature, language and story telling.  and one to share with one's friends and loved ones.
 I love to read and it's not often a story captivates me to the point where I find myself holding my breath as I read.  This was one of those stories. I was drawn to the characters from page one and as each new character was introduced, they added more depth and I found myself pulled into the story that much more. Definitely a book I'll hold dear and recommend to others often.
 This is a great book. I couldn't imagine a story narrated by DEATH. But, it was amazing. Considering the time it was set it was appropriate. Human, tender, you are rooting for the characters. I think this is a must read.
 Enlightening  to experience  the realities of frightening times of Hitler through the perspective of Death the respectful narrator, and how it all impacted non-jews in profoud ways we wondered about. memorable and important to share with others as we need to honor and protect HUMANITY while there are so many forces in the world that threaten our values and compassion.
 One of my favorite books!
 There is nothing bad you can say about a book of this caliber. The characters were so colorful and believable that you really invested yourself in them. A wonderful tale woven with rich history. Both entertaining and informative…who could ask for more?
 I found this hard to get into,but it had received such good reviews,I persevered with it and even half way I wasn't sure but suddenly it grabbed me and I couldn't put it down.The characters all fell,fully formed in place,till the end.
 The words in this book are the magnificent brushstrokes of an artist who draws us into the story and makes us a part of the picture. Experiencing this terrible time in our human history from those not directly involved in armed combat begs the question, especially as seen through The Narrator's perspective, - how would I and those I love respond in like circumstances?  A thought provoking and "hard to put down" book.
 Breathtaking and the best in modern literature.  A must read.
 This book is worth the language alone - words used differently, creating more powerful images, and use of senses.  I could "taste" scenes, "hear" silences, "chew" on visions in a way never thought of before.<br/><br/>The story is powerful with well-crafted language mentioned above.
 Somehow, the tale of tragedy, loss, and pain is given an objective beauty when told by the grim reaper himself. He has experienced human suffering in all its extremes and still able to afford it an un-jaded respect. The innocence of the child, and her capacity for empathy and compassion in spite of her own tragedy, is so much more poignant related from this viewpoint. Countless books have been written about Nazi Germany and its cruelty and suffering, but Markus Zusak has created a work of awesome talent and importance.
 I loved the way this book took you inside the world of Nazi Germany, showing you that not all Nazis are bad. I loved the struggle and the jokes. It was really interesting how "death" shows how in war no one really wins. i wish that it had ended differently though. i wish ***********SPOILER ALERT************ that Rudy, Papa and Mama hadn't died, and if anything I wish Rudy could have gotten his kiss when he was still alive. This book seems to show you that WWII was not only sad and painful for those in concentration camps, but also for other people who have done nothing to deserve their fate.
 Such a heart warming book. It shows how a family was able to survive the atrocities of war and never give up on the human race. The author draws you in and you become a part of the family. Very seldom do I comment on a book but this one was so touching that I had to comment.
 Such a well written story about this young girl in Germany. Still hard to imagine in this day and age what happened in those years, yet this story managed to embrace the struggle and strife of these people.  The author captured my heart with all their stories.
 Most unusual technique  it is not the start to finish novel Americans are used to reading. Albeit this has been translated yet it has kept the Euro charm of the original. I have not seem the movie. This read brought alive the Germany of the third reich in a new light. Extremely well written and a great experience.
 I purchased this book a while ago and put off reading it because I'd heard that it was difficult to get into. I didn't find that to be the case. I was hooked right away. It's a beautiful and sad story.
 I was sad when I finished this book and wanted to start it all over again.  Great writing, great characters, great story.  I only just now read it because it was my book club pick this month.  It's a book I will not forget for a long time to come.
 There was something about this book that I hated, yet at the same time I could not put it down.  It is an interesting perspective.  I loved the characters and the stories.  I found the point of view of the German's who were against Hitler interesting.  It is not often we see them.  I guess what bothered me was the haunting way the book stays me.  The images that it creates.  For some reason the violence and hate are so much more moving here.  We should never forget!
 omg..this book touched me in a way nothing else has.  God bless all the Jewish people who lost their lives to the wicked heart of that ass, Hitler.  I laughed, I cried, but this book has touched me forever
 I have not seen the movie made about this book but thoroughly enjoyed reading it. The young girl in the book does not realize what her Jewish grandmother went throuh under the Nazi regime and only comes to appreciate her own Jewishness as the story evolves.
 So I bought this book for my son to read for his English class. The book was long and so to motivate him, I told him I would read it with him. I wasn't too excited about it, but I wanted to help him. Well, I'm an old foggie, but I was pleasantly surprised with the book. The book was intriguing, sad, funny - it had a way of paining the scenery and the events in such a way that I could imagine them in my head. I definitely recommend the book - old or young.
 So sophisticated and poignant it hardly seems YA.  I teach middle school ELA and I'm planning to use excerpts within our Holocaust unit, hopefully encouraging the students to pick up the book and read it independently.  The "narrator" makes the realities of that time accessible for a younger reader, while not scaring them beyond the point of understanding.
 I really only read this book because I ALWAYS read the book before I see the movie based on it.  But now as my heart cries, I am so happy that its words are forever with me.  It's beautifully and sarcastically written and the voice of the book is priceless.  Every character is fleshed out and the ending did not disappoint.
 I am awestruck by the prose, the beautifully and tightly woven tale and the humanity of Liesl, Rudy, her foster parents... Everything.  One of the best writers if our time in my mind, and I cannot wait to read more from him.  If you are thinking about it, get the audiobook.  It is wonderfully narrated!
 It took me a while to figure the "Narrator" out but once I did, he gave me pause for thought.  It was interesting to read about WWII from the perspective of the German citizens.  So tragic for they were victims as well.  I would highly recommend this book, as well as the movie.  It was haunting.
 The Book Thief was a touching story I enjoyed very much.  It is rather haunting, the characters vivid, the descriptions surprising and unusual.  I would recommend this book as an absorbing read.  I happened to read it in Vienna and it was most meaningful.
 Loved the complexities of this novel, written  from the stories of people who lived through this awful war. Loved the companion narration by Audible.
 This book is a different and difficult read , not only for its format but for it's content. You will find yourself in Germany during world war I I.<br/>I am glad I read it , but it is not an easy read.
 I will definitely be rereading this down the road.  That's the best recommendation I can give!<br/><br/>Interesting characters and plot.  Fascinating way of writing.  (Even if some of the vocabulary did annoy me at times....  The again, I'm nearly 69.)
 This book took several efforts to read. Possibly the translation left gaps that my mind had to fill, or maybe just the writer's style was hard for me to understand. I did finally settle down and finish it - thinking somewhere it would justify the reading time....it did not.
 Great read
 I enjoyed the book very much but at times I didn't really know which characters were who. Yes I would recommend It to anyone!<br/>I haven't watched the movie as I was told by a friend to be sure to read the book first.
 This book captivated me from the very first page, not only because of the incredibly beautiful writing but because of who is telling the story and the format in which it is told.<br/><br/>"The Book Thief" is at times heartbreakingly sad, laugh-out-loud funny, deeply poignant, thought-provoking and educational -- and always entertaining. What more could one ask for between the covers of a book?<br/><br/>I read the last couple of chapters at a snail's pace because I just didn't want it to end.
 It took me a chapter or two to really get into it but when I did I could not put it down, another insight on what went on in Germany among the average or poor communities.
 Amazing book. Was put off buying it for a long time as I didn't want to read another WW2 hyped up drama. But wow the book totally blown has blow me away with its original spin. Who better to narrate a novel like this but death and death has a great sense of humor.  The book was so good that I read it twice in a row (I haven't done that in a long long time)
 This was one of the best books I have ever read! The characterization of death was uniquely done. Having just visited the National Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.,  reading this book visualized the people and the events again. Recommended for all to read to remember and to grasp the power of the words to entertain, hurt, destroy, build, comfort or empower. May we use our words with respect and affection towards all people.
 ....because you will not be able to put it down once it grabs you.  I had to get used to the story coming from an unusual narrator.  Don't want to give away more than that.  Read it, you'll love it.
 The plot takes you away to a world we don't often hear about. Character development gives the reader that insight into personalities at just the right moment.. Seeing the good, and bad, in human nature. Very satisfying as a reader. I was moved by this strong tale.
 The only thing I didn't like about the book is how the story seemed to jump around too much and got confusing after awhile. However, the overall content of the book was interesting, heartwarming, devastating, and beautiful all rolled into one. I would highly recommend it!
 As I started to read I was not so sure I would like the book because it has a fairly slow beginning . I now know how wrong I was. The book can make you cry and laugh at the same time. This is by far the most emotional book I have ever read . I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did .
 I liked the book. I also liked the audio but the reader was not that enthusiast. I enjoyed this book so much. Recommend this
 I found this book a page turner, the girl is precious.  This time a story about the German people who were not quite Nazis, a different point of view about people who suffered through a terrible war.  Very heartwarming, would like to see the movie.
 This is one of the best books I've ever read. The characters go immediately to your heart, and the story is fantastic. But the narration is what makes it. Just read the book.
 this book was so good. told from death's point of view - i thought that was a unique perspective, especially for this story.<br/><br/>but be warned it's a tear-jerker. don't read it at the gym, because crying on the treadmill is awkward.
 There is nothing I can say about the Book Thief that hasn't been said.  It is a book that must be read.  It touched me in a way that no other book about this time period has touched me.  I became part of the characters.  I cried, laughed and my heart broke; not only for them but for all who endured.  This is a book that deserves your time.
 The imagery in the writing is very well done. It definitely sucked me in. 10/10 would recommend.
 A bit confusing in the beginning, but as soon as I figured out that "Death" was doing the narrating I really enjoyed the book.<br/>The book was well written and it didn't take me long to fall in love with the characters, especially Rudy.
 Initially, I wasn't sure if I'd like the book, but as I got into it, it captured my entire attention.  It is hopeful and hopeless, sad and humorous.  I captured the horrors of war and the indomitable spirit of humanity.  Great book.  Can't wait to see the movie.
 I was thoroughly intrigued by the author's style, and I appreciated the focus from the perspective of the German people struggling to live through an horrendous war and and the spirit of characters to help the Jews and each other as they found ways to give love &amp; forgiveness. It's  a book well worth reading by adults and teens. The author's postscript at the end is a valuable teaching lesson for young writers, too.
 I bought it as a gift and the front cover is beautiful. It makes a nice impression. I personally have not read the book myself but it was a requested gift idea from my sister who said she wanted to own this book after borrowing it from a local library.
 Slow reading at first but once I got into story I had hard time putting it down. Last section brought me to tears. I have read other books of this time period but this was very differentfrom anything else I have read. It will stay with me for a long time.
 I've been intrigued with books before, but this story line was so thrilling.  Leaving me not wanting to put it down.  Very interesting perspective. (I don't want to give anything away, so I'll let it go at that)
 This book opens your eyes and touches your soul in so many ways. The perspective in which this book is written is unique and allows you to delve deeper into each character especially liesel, by seeing them from an outside perspective that can see inside in a way no human can, if that makes sense. I give it 5 stars for many reasons but mostly for its morals and inspiration. This book teaches. It is a priceless novel. I recommend it to everyone age 14 or so and up. Truly there are no words I can write that would justly describe this amazing story, you'll have to read it yourself.
 Historic.
 I really enjoyed this book. I read it for my book club and all we had a great discussion. It shows you the other side of WII in Germany, the people that weren't backing Hitler and a little girl stuck in the middle of all of it. Great!
 Although I read this book years ago I wanted to reread before seeing the movie. I recall loving it but it was even better this second time.. Such a richness and depth of language, story and characters.  This book says so much and says it so well. Thank u Marcus zusak.
 The story line is very interesting giving the reader a different perspective of the German people during WWII . I had seen the movie and loved it. This is what drew me to read the book. However, I like the movie better because it did not tell you ahead of the story the outcomes, while the book does. I like to be surprised by an ending.
 I feared this would be another tear jerker about Jewish people caught up in the Holocaust. It is much more. Germany had many other people living there. What were their lives like? It has been so far a most thought provoking book I have read in a long time. Well packaged. I have nothing to complain about.
 Liked the style of the book, it held my attention. Very insightful and although fiction, very real.  I think the author represented the atmosphere .  First book I have enjoyed thoroughly in a while.  It makes you think and reflect.  I read the book twice.
 I have read so many "Nazi Germany-concentration camp" stories and have been so caught up in each and every one of them.  But this tells the story from a different (for me) viewpoint. I wasn't sure at first if I was going to like the book, but the farther I got into the story the more intrigued I became.  I didn't realize until I finished the book that it is now a movie and I can't wait to see that. I would highly recommend this to anyone even vaguely interested in this part of history.
 Great story.  I was disappointed that the text to speech was not available on the kindle version. I like to listen to books when I'm stuck in traffic, doing housework, or exercising.
 Poetic, beautiful, captivating. Not a typical Holocaust story, a very different perspective of the wartime. The story is compelling and the characters draw you in and inhabit you, and the wonderful, stunningly crafted sentences are somehow also effortless. The description/blurb doesn't do this book justice. It's one of those stories that will leave you feeling thoughtful, emotional, charged, exhausted, alert, and heavy all at once.
 I truly enjoyed the narrative style and perspective of this story. It has one of the best and most haunting final sentences I've read in contemporary literature. I've not read many books placed on this side of WWII, it certainly was revealing as to the inner turmoil of a German citizen horrified by their country's leader and helpless to act on their own compassion, out if the desperate need to survive. This will go on my shelf next to The Diary of Anne Frank, and both will be well-worn from endless reads.
 This book was uncomfortable to read, but I couldn't put it down. Words were a central theme of this book and Zusak's words, as narrated by death, told a tragic and beautiful story of the horrors of Hitler's war. He has an interesting and unusual style that is a refreshing departure from the norm.  Highly recommended.
 Purchased as a gift for my fiancé. Was very happy with the shipping time, price and quality of the book. She said she really enjoyed the book.
 A child’s life is dramatically changed by the couple who raises her in war time Europe.
 This book was great.  It was difficult to read at times, because the subject matter invokes a deep reaching sadness. Humanity isn't always at its best. The writing was amazingly creative and I would recommend it to all. Definitely 5 stars.
 I would recommend this book, it was a great book and I really enjoyed the author's writing style.<br/>Of course this part of history is always sad to think it actually happened it still makes for a good book.<br/>We need to be reminded of past history.
 Excellent, excellent book. Very clearly portrays how good people tried and failed, and hurt on the German side of the war trying so hard not to be part of the hateful war machine. Well written.
 I thought this was a great story. I knew where that chld was comming from. She loves books as much as me. Would I have had the courage she had? I wondered as I read the book. I know like her I would have hidden away to read. this story touched me.
 Very well written. Unusual and very moving.
 I loved this book and want to read the next one from this author. I have never read a book touching on the Holocaust from the viewpoint of a German citizen in a small town. It was fascinating and the writing was poetic, beautiful.
 Eloquently and uniquely narrated by he who is most acquainted with the destruction humans heap upon one another; Death himself. And who knew that Death was actually so full of compassion that it overflows his macabre mien to give us a story so perceptive and beautiful as this: that in the midst of intense human suffering, the unquenchable soul of a young girl can rise above the fog of misery to find the light on the other side of her despair.
 The Book Thief it's an amazing and beautifully written book. I've never read something like it. Every character was important to the story and had their own background which gave them so much more depth. I can only define the story as a beautiful tragedy. It made me cry, laugh, smile, and it also gave a sort of disappointing feeling toward humans, like "How could something like this happen? Why did we allow it?" This book is the kind that gives you an important lesson, a book from which you learn, a book that changes you with the power of words. And in my opinion those are always the best...
 This is a great book for history lovers of World War 2. It is nice to read a story about people in the hardest of times that are still wiling to risk their lives for other people that are being wronged.
 Enjoyed the book
 It's a book that takes a moment to grow on you, but once it does, you can't put it down for the sheer beauty of it. All of the characters are completely and finely described and leave you loving each.  Recommend this book to anyone who loves a poetic rendering of the world as it really is, and people as they really are.
 This was a very interesting book.  I like it that the narrator is death.  I felt that I knew the characters.
 Good Read!
 I had not heard good things about the movie so I was not sure I would like the book. But, my husband was reading it and he liked it a lot (very unusual for him) so I had to get it. The story is compelling, the characters are brilliantly sketched and the narrator is mysterious.<br/><br/>Good job, Mr. Zusak!
 Awesome book! I read it with 7th graders and its very engaging!  Great perspective of the holocaust from a child. Also has a movie to compare/contrast
 What a brilliant literary work. I admit I read it too fast to fully probe the depth of Zusak's literary style, deep meanings, narrative perspective, and poignant reflection. Many sentences within deserve to be extracted, printed on fine paper, and pay a good craftsman to frame. All these things I many do in time.  I will give it a year or two and buy it in hardback and linger over its pages.
 From the very first page this book was an example of writing as a true art form. I loved the idea of the perspective of such an unusual narrator. There was real "heart" in this book, and I was moved to tears at the end, and laughter throughout.
 Well written, very descriptive, excellent book for discussion about WW II and how it effected the people living in Germany. You were drawn into the main characters quickly and traveled through the story with them - one of the best books I've read in a while. Highly recommend.
 I found this book to be good and clever in the sense that death was the narrator. However, it took me about a year to actually finish the book.  I think some chapters were too much detail, slowed the story down and made me lose interest.  However, there were also chapters, particularly those that involved Liesel and Max or Liesel and Rudy that made me want to pick up the book and continue reading.  Now I can watch the movie.
 For me this was a new perspective of life of ordinary Germans during WWII.  It is told from the perspective of the grim reaper and he was sometimes funny when he talked about things like our vision of him.  Over all I liked the book but it was very slow sometimes.
 This is the story of a refugee German girl growing up in Nazi Germany, told from Death's perception.  It was quite an unusual and intriguing writing style.  A little hard to follow at times.  I have not seen the movie.  I would recommend this book
 I loved the movie and wanted to read the book.  Of course, there are some differences in the movie, but that is to be expected.  The title didn't make much sense in the movie, because Liesel kept giving the books back, which wasn't stealing.  The book clarified  it.  The appalling and tragic Nazi regime and how it affected ordinary German citizens is brought out in the story.  Making "Death" the narrator of the story gave it a particularly interesting perspective.
 At first I was confused... So confused I almost gave up on reading it and just went straight to watch the movie. But something glued me and kept me reading and I'm glad that happened. I absolutely loved this book, and it is SO much better than the movie. In fact, if you haven't seen the movie, I recommend you just read the book and leave it like that.
 I picked up this book on the recommendation of a coworker. It had a kind of slow start. The story seemed a little disconnected. Then the war. The war changed everything. I cannot imagine living "in" the war. It is all I can say. Don't put it down till you make it to the war. Then it may very well be difficult to put down.<br/>jk
 Very well written. I was disappointed with the movie and can't understand why Hollywood just can't seem to make a movie that keeps with the writing of a book. Some of the most important issues were not in the movie and that led to an almost boring movie.<br/>Really enjoyed this reading.
 Wonderful, could not put it down.  I wasn't sure at first because it was narrated by DEATH.  This actually made it a very different book.  It gets right into your soul.  Quite different.<br/><br/>A totally different way to see all that happened during WWII.
 Great
 I did not expect how the story was being told, with who was "narrating" the story. It was a good perspective. I wanted to read this book before the movie (as I do with most books that become movies). I will now watch the movie.
 such a good book that it appears in your mind as a picture as soon as the words are digested. no wonder it is a movie. as the plot is moving and realistic. hard to put down, it seems to be a true story.
 one of the greatest book and movie of all times, very touching and inspiring. I loved every page, and it is not boring or too hard to read. Death is the narrator which make things more personal, and the story more real.<br/>I definitely recommend this book.
 I am still reading the  breathtaking  Book Thief (slowly so it lasts longer). At this point I just would like to add a word to Mr. Zusak's impressive store of post-war  vocabulary,  especially concerning  the term "Saumensch" -- and thereby also  validating the  absolute truth of his tale.<br/>In January of 1945 during the bitterest winter of the century  my mother, not actually inspired by Horace Greely, but  taking into account that there are  marked  shades of  difference between one evil and the next, packed up my sister and me  and  started a desperate trek westward to escape the approaching Red Army. Finally  we ran out of time and geography, and got stuck in Bavaria, (Germany) for several years. There  I cannot remember being called anything else, but Sau-Ungarin -- Hungarian she-pig. I was eleven at the time. So mark it my dear fellow readers,  this special jewel of a term with all its nasty connotations is now further enriching the fabric of our cherished  Western civilization.  Heaven help us!<br/>It is fortunate for us that when Mr. Zusak touches the  insanity of the mid-twentieth century he is so very gentle  that he can actually  make the past bearable. For us survivors of that hell  his humor and his humanity is very like Papa's presence was to Liesl.
 We all know the basic story of World War II but Zusak tells "the book thief's" story so creatively, and passionately. He has a great sense of humor throughout the story and yet leaves you stunned with extremely dark sentiments. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to all my friends who are avid readers.
 The colors and the descriptive writing were a wonderful way to tell a heart breaking story of the horror of WW II and the humanity amidst the inhumanity. As horrible that the war was there was still beauty in people.
 An insightful perspective on living in Germany during the Second World War under the Nazis, from the point of view of a bright young girl who survived miraculously, and was rescued by a non-Jewish family.  Characters are well-defined and not easily stereotyped.  Sad and enlightening.
 The omniscient narrator "Death" that is with a capital D is incredible. I usually first judge a novel by how the narrator develops the story. All I can say is Bravo. This is a tour de force in narration. I would never think of Death as empathetic, and now I truly have a new vision.
 It is a rare gift when an author can take such a horrific story, especially one that actually happened, and make it beautiful. For me the subject matter seems a little too traumatic for teens but maybe it's something they need to understand.  Liesel is one of those characters that you fight for from page one. You hope she gets everything she ever wanted and it breaks your heart as much as hers when she doesn't. I LOVED THIS BOOK!
 Journey of one child in Nazi Germany and the difference reading made.  A wonderful book on human relationships and our gifts to each other that make life have quality and love beyond all hardships...
 The author, Markus Zusak, has woven together a story of remarkable characters and given us such insight into their lives it's as if you are walking the streets with them! His use of poetic structure graces the reader with such images which lift your spirit at times and then leaves you in tears as the story unfolds. Truly a magnificent read!
 No wonder this is ranked so high for young readers, but it is also a great book for adults.  It captures a tragic time from the eyes of the people who could do little or nothing to help, but did what they could and suffered because they could not do more.  Wonderfully written as well.  I recommend it very highly.
 Written in a strange way but once you get used to that it is an easy read. As with all stories about the holocaust it is extremely sad in many places but also uplifting. Many, many people showed their great compassion for others and did not blindly follow Hitler. The power of the written word yet again proves how valuable it is!
 Loved the way this book was narrated.  The story was so heartfelt and written in such an imaginative way.  It is poignant and endearing.  The characters are rich and so very interesting at the same time being so very human.  Love this authors style!
 Confusing at times. Overall, good story
 This tragic tale is a grim reminder of how words can be used and abused to create weapons of mass destruction.  Fear can fuel humans to accomplish both heroic and horrific feats!  I was catapulted from my comfy couch to Nazi Germany where I could not escape the stench of death, I felt their palpable hunger and became intertwined in the lives and deaths of each character.  The author evokes emotions of love, hate, admiration, pity, pride, shame, anger, joy, elation and defeat at exponentially audible levels accompanied by a trail of tear soaked tissues.  This story and it's characters touched my soul and stole my heart.
 This" story written  for junior high school children uses  historical information about world war TWO In an easy to read and understand story .  The childs everyday life in Germany  during the war  does not embelIish the horror as TV and movies  sometimes can.  The everyday activities of the children lives show their  normal routines at school and home.  The bombings are are in the background.  One can identify  with their feelings.  we are aware of the adults  and their  real fears.  They do not discuss Hitler ,but the ration of food and products  enters everyday life.  Well written , a gentle intro to a sad time in our History
 It's a fine book.  Not sure what I expected.  Slow at times but good enough that I wanted to finish reading it.
 The book held my interest from beginning to end. One of my best reads ever. Beautifully written; the author and his narrator creates a mood that totally captivated me. Don't see the movie as it is a total waist of time.
 If you have a sum of time  on your hands this  I  a great book to read. It it easy to follow along and a great book!
 The slow pace at the beginning are just setting you up and making you become intimate with the lively characters.  By the end of the book they are so real you mourn their losses and cheer for their joys
 This is a story of a young girl left with strangers in Germany at the beginning of the war.  She has to find her place in a new family an MAKE new friends da.  She is very insecure but becomes.more co rodent and happy in due time.  Many different feelings vs involved, but the humanity of everyone in the story is fantastic.
 One of the best books that I have ever read.  It was even better than the movie.  it provides a fresh look at death, World War II, and the insanity of war.  Most importantly, it shows the triumph of humanity over the evil that lurks in our world.  I strongly recommend everyone to read it.  It should be mandatory for High School English classes.
 it was a gift and they liked it
 The Book Thief grabbed my attention at the beginning and held it throughout.  Although at first put off by the identity of the "narrator", I soon understood the significance and importance of Death being the observer and teller of the story.  I would recommend The Book Thief to any reader curious as to what average citizens' life would have been like under the Third Reich, those moral, caring German citizens doing their best to understand and cope with this new way of life and to survive under its brutal and confusing (at least to a ten year old orphaned girl) rules.
 A tender story from the perspective of death. Nicely told. Showing the heartbreak of war and how different personalities deal with the horrors of war.
 Please read it.  It's very hard to get through, especially if you love a Jew and know how this kind of story hollows them out.  Also if you know a German.  The humor saved me. Liesel and Papa saved me, and, if course Rudy.<br/>Extraordinary.
 I cried so much reading this book. I'm thankful that the author foretold most of the tragic events instead of revealing everything as a big surprise. I don't know if my little heart could've handled it all. It broke so many times already...<br/><br/>It started off depicting the "normal" lives of children in Nazi Germany, and I thought the pacing was a bit slow. It was hard to get through at first, but in retrospect establishing the initial normalcy made the ending even more beautiful. Absolutely lovely book.
 A wonderful, well written book.  The  narration is unique and well done. Although the story tells of a  horrific period in our history, it was beautifully written, describing very sad moments and hilarious conversations between Liesel  and Rudy.
 It's  a great book, surprising at the beginning, narrative a little confusing but then after a quick bit understand it. It takes place in World War Two Germany. Mentions bits a pieces about the holocaust, Outstanding narrative. Can't spoil everything ;)
 Good story, but just ho hum for me.I loved that someone would find books so precious that she has to steal them, but the writer just didn't draw me in. This is only one person's opinion. Everyone else loves it. So try and see what you think yourself.
 I very rarely watch the movie before I read the book - but in this case, I read the book because of the movie.  I loved the movie and although I initially had trouble getting into the book because I knew what was going to happen, I loved the book even more.  The book was able to go into greater detail and the imagery was beautiful. It was so much better to read the picture then see the picture.  This book is very well written and I will read the other book by this author - I definite "must read"!
 This is such an amazing book. It's so moving and powerful... just wow.<br/>It is a little hard to get into but it's well worth the short struggle. In fact the ending is harder to read since you'll be reading through your tears.<br/>Symbolic, stresses the importance of words<br/>Simply astonishingly astoundingly amazing book.
 Markus Zusak reminds us that many German people where good folks with simple lives during the horrific events of WW II.  Somehow he is able to make us understand the daily challenges that Germans were faced with and we sympathize.  A very tender novel.
 One of the best books I have read on the topic of German occupation during WWII.  It's hard to imagine that this kind of thing went on, but this book takes a very personal look at how it affected a young girl who loved books and did many things to obtain them.
 This book is written so beautifully and so strangely. I cannot imagine the effort it took for the writer to complete a nonlinear novel with such clarity. I read little fiction but this one is one I will recommend over and over. Fabulous. Really.
 The author captured my interest from the beginning.  The subject of Nazi Germany and how people survived the rigors of everyday life is hard to imagine.  The author gives very good insight into what it was like for one girl and her family.
 It is a marvelous story about Nazi Germany and how a small family copes. The girl featured in the story does more than steal books; she steals hearts and her interactions with those around her lets us see into the souls of the people most affected by Hitler - those who followed him as well as those who feared and hated him.<br/><br/>This book should be required reading for high school students. Too many young folks know nothing about Hitler and the Nazis and the fact that a large percentage of Germans hated and feared Hitler. If we don't know history, we are apt to repeat it.
 This book was truly an amazing read. Each word and each line are intricately woven together and allow you to both see, hear, and at times even touch their beauty. The intense joys and saddened of the human experience are expressed beautifully in this book. A must read...and reread.
 I had wanted to read the book since the movie came out in the theaters.  This genre of book fascinates me.  I could hardly put it down!  It pulls you into the drama as it unfolds, as if you are transported back into time.  It gives hope and inspires!
 I genuinely loved this entire book.  The perspective is very interesting and unique, as it is a story written by Death himself.  The characters are all very well fleshed out, and each one goes through an interesting character arc.  The writing style is entertaining and fun in parts and completely devastating in others.  I'll admit it:  I cried, often and hard, while reading this novel.<br/><br/>For a review comparing the book to the movie, I wrote this blog post:   ...]
 The story unfolds with the most poetic of words, such as "she spoke so softly that words born on her breath died on her lips."  It takes place in WWII torn Germany, and the depiction of joy, endurance and heartache moved me to tears of both laughter and pain.  The author Marcus Zusak is a gift to readers everywhere.
 Great story EVER!!!! The way is told rocks<br/>The characters are so well thought and plotted is just impossible to not fall totally in love with them all<br/>I enjoyed it inmensley
 A dark and gripping tale of Nazi Germany from a unique perspective that is at once unique and dark.  Insights into life from a perspective not often seen or understood.  Incredible book I highly recommend; memorable and unforgettable.
 "The Book Thief" was a riveting story about a young German girl, Liesel, who faced tragedy early in life and lost her little brother on a train to meet her step parents . The year was 1939 in Himmel, Germany and much persecution had already begun against the Jews. The family hid a young man in their basement. Liesel proceeded to steal books, which she continued throughout the story.<br/>The whole book being narrated by death, a character who told his take on the human race. A very moving, worthwhile read.
 Touching, gripping and sooo well written! This is one of those rare books you will want to add to your permanent collection, share with those you love and reread every so often. An absolute must have! Buy it, read it, share it - you'll be glad you did!
 Very good book. Brings to life the devastation of war and poverty. Also shows happiness can be found in the simplest things.
 Who can resist a story told from the point of view of death?  Not me.  Good story, easy read.  I don't want to say anything else about the story itself so the readers can enjoy the book without any spoilers.  I recommend it and now can go see the movie!
 This book, while following a tragic story line and horrible circumstances, is beautifully and creatively written. The narration was most shocking to me, but it fit and it fit so well. You must read this book.
 Just read this for a Book Club and was not disappointed.  It was one of the best books I've read in a long time.  If you've seen the movie, please do not judge by that.  The movie does not do justice the language and emotion you get from the book.  It is also not just another WWII, Hitler, Germany, book.  The Book Thief received one of the highest over-all ratings of any book in my club, and we are a tough crowd.
 The Book Thief is a beautifully and astutely written book about content and horror that has been told many times. I balked at my first attempts to read it. I will not see the movie. No way can a movie capture what the words of a thief can give.
 Interesting writing style. Excellent story line, the author makes you feel, see and smell the experiences of life that Leisel endured. The characters are well developed and come alive. I highly recommend reading this book.
 I chose 5 stars because this is an amazing HISTORICAL FICTION! It tells of a girl named Liesel Meminger. She has a tough life but loves her Papa and Mama. But this story is one I've recommended for adults. I'm a fifth grader and it got pretty heavy! If you enjoy World War 2 books you'll enjoy this immensely. I encourage you to read and learn! You'll be very interested and find out cool facts!!!!
 Got this for my daughter and she loved it.
 Absolutely breathtaking, beautiful narration and structure. The descriptive language and personification really captured all the essences of the characters, incredible.
 It was as happy of an ending any story set in Germany during that time could achieve with shining examples of goodness to counter the hatred and devastation.<br/>I won't watch the movie as my heart is broken quite enough
 The horrors of the Nazi occupation through the eyes of a child.  It starts out slow and somewhere in the first half you find yourself actually there.  No dramatic, exciting action - just a view of everyday life in a way that gets beneath the skin.
 I have recommended this book to my friends, and those who read it also liked it. His characters are so believable you don't want anything bad to happen to them, but you know you can't prevent history from happening. I did not want to put this book down once I began reading it. Do we learn from history? What is going on around us today?
 I loved this book.  The narrator is Death and he tells a compelling story of a young German girl, during the years leading up to and during World War II. We all know the horrors that occurred in Germany during this time period, but this book offers a touching perspective that really makes you think.  It is well written and imaginative.  I highly recommend this book.
 It is so sad. I do not normally read sad books, but had heard so much about this one.  I did like the way that Markus Zusak used "Death" as the narrator.  It was hard for me to put it down while reading it.
 We chose this for our book club to read and I found it very good. I probably would not have chosen it but I'm glad we did. The story was well written and after you realize that death is a major part of the story it all comes together.
 A different view being written thru the eyes of the Grimm Reaper.  I liked it very much because of the innocence of the children in the story and the love they and their parents had for each other in such a horrific time in the history of the world.<br/><br/>I recommend it to the generation of today who think they have it "so tough", and find their lives so "boring", even tho most things are handed to them on a silver platter. Leisle will show them the way!
 Great book
 Thank goodness,  I had the audible version and could also read along as so desired because "I read" it in  less than 4 days<br/>It made me sad, happy, anxious, I could not not put it down. This book was recommended to me, and now I will recommend it to<br/>Several people.
 This book was recommended and just finished a book so I was ready for something new.  This book has all the bells and whistle of all the emotions that any human can deal with.  Most of the time and in most circumstance you can do more than you think your capable  of doing.
 I loved this book and have been suggesting it to friends all over!  I thought "no more Nazi books for awhile!" but this one isn't like any other I've ever read, it used different voices and some pictures to convey a life no one should have to endure.
 Superb..fantastic...awesome..Will think recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading.  Very well written and tells a story that needed to be told...lest we dare to forget those who lived that time and that space in history
 I found this book a bit slow in parts but still and all a compelling read.  It kept me coming back to discover what becomes of The Book Thief and her family..  It was different in that the narrator is "Death".  I now have plans to see the movie.
 Very good story.  A whole different perspective on the holocaust.  Sad, enjoyable, interesting.  Worth reading.
 Love this book.  We ordered it for my son for required reading for his War Fiction class and I ended up reading it after he was done.  It is a great book and I understand why they are making a movie out of it now.
 The Book Thief was an unexpected thrill of a ride to read. Beautifully written, amazing character arcs, plots, twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The book may be long, but it is such an interesting read you will find it hard to put this book down and you'll pick it up sooner than you realize. Rich, descriptive, funny, insightful, sad, and humbling, this book was an absolute pleasure to read and explore!!!!
 I could not stop reading and was so sorry to reach its finish. I. wanted it to go on and on. I cannot imagine a movie doing justice to this book. I am in awe of the author's gift of imagery.
 Using Death as the narrator of this story was a stroke of genius on the part of Markus Zusak, as Death certainly "lived" in World War II Germany.  Then, to balance the horror, the author brought to life a young girl in the midst of it all.  I believe every school child should read this book - with his parents.  Never forget...
 The Book Thief is the best means of conveying the horrors of war!  Death is the narrator who can tell the story from a somewhat unbiased view, and yet even Death has his favorites!  This book ranks up there with To Kill a Mocking Bird!
 This is all the good that you've heard it is. A difficult subject handled well and involving great characters.
 I was surprised at the format the publisher used.  It took sometime to get used to the format.  Once I became comfortable with it, I found the writing and story line compelling.  Believe me it was hard to put down until I finished.
 This book provided great detail about life that probably happened for Germans during WWII. Even though with the tremendous destru- ction and loss, it would definitely warm your heart as you read through the interesting life of an adopted, smart girl by the name of Liesel.<br/><br/>9.5\10 it was a really awesome book, unless you can't handle the loss.
 This was a very moving book that gives insight into daily life among the German poor during Q=World War II.  It also shows the small but dangerous acts of bravery that many people engaged in.
 I read this book based on the recommendations I found here on amazon. When I first started reading it, I then got really hooked on it and I just couldn't stop! The story about the war reminds of my own time going through the war in my country. This story brings back so many old memories, the good ones and the bad ones. It was excellent in the way it was written on the perspective of Death itself. I just couldn't put the book down!
 What a story! When first starting it I talked to some girls who had read it for school. I asked if it was the angel of death and they did not know who that was but said no. I realized it was the narrator. What a wonderful way to present this story.
 It's taken me months to finish due to schedules and work but each time I picked it back up I was anxious to continue the story. Touching. Heartfelt. Tragic. Amazingly written.
 It's slightly difficult reading until you get involved in it, but oh so rewarding if you stay with it. The story line is great and you begin to live with the characters. After you read the book, pick up the movie and see it. Read the book first.
 I began by wondering if I would be able to follow the story. Once I had read the first two chapters, I was drawn in by the beautiful, haunting words of the author. The Book Thief displays what the German people felt and dealt with during the Nazi reign.
 I learned a great deal about Germany from a more intimate viewpoint than, say The 3rd Reich, but what impressed me the most was the style - beautifully-written and poignant. I'm still not sure about Death as the narrator but...
 Well written.  Told from an interesting perspective...death.  Kept my interest and the story told so well that I do not want to see the movie.  Cleverly written in a format which made this type of book easier to read.  The author brought me into the emotion of the story.  Highly recommend.
 The fluid movement the author gives to words, to the telling of the story, is captivating. I was instantly pulled into the story, living and feeling it from start to finish. Often, I had to read and reread passages to either enjoy them as I enjoy eating chocolate....slowly to taste every delicious sweetness.....or to let the pain subside like waiting for the place in your arm to stop hurting after getting a shot. A wonderful experience.
 This is a well written account of how WWII effected the lives of ordinary German people and how they seemed to be pulled along in the stream of insanity by Adolf Hitler. Death, the narrator, is pictured as a merciful and kind deliver of soles.
 I loved this book. Right from the start you have to get used to the amazing concept that it is narrated by Death. All the plot turns take you by surprise, and you find yourself caring deeply about the characters. For the first time I really felt what it was like to live in Nazi Germany. Serious but with a very light touch.
 This has been on my “to read” list for a long time. I picked it up over one school break but didn’t get very far before my classes started again and I just couldn’t keep up with it. So I picked it up again this summer and this time couldn’t put it down! What a unique story! World War II/ Holocaust stories are usually pretty difficult for me to read, and understandably so. What a sad time in our world’s history! This story, however, was so intriguing because it was told in such a unique way.<br/><br/>This book is the story of Liesel, a little girl who is taken in by the Hubermanns in Nazi occupied Germany. The story of Liesel, the Hubermanns and others is told through the narration of Death. Yes, Death narrates this story, and there could not be a more appropriate or unique voice to do so. I thought at first that a book narrated by Death could be nothing but sad and tragic, but it gives the book such an interesting spin. The story is told by the one voice that witnessed humans at their best and humans at their worst.<br/><br/>And of course, underlying all of this is the desperation of one little girl to get her hands on non-Nazi literature during a time when books were being banned and burned. It really is a tale of the war unlike any other I’ve ever read. Many of you have very possibly already read this book, but if you haven’t or if it’s been on your “to-read” list too, then I highly recommend you pick it up – soon!<br/><br/>Read full review at: KaitsBookshelf.com
 You are travelling with a young girl in her loneliness and pain through the ravages of Hitler's Germany. You are there as a small village is transformed; forced to hate, commanded to endure, and you will watch, transfixed, as one innocent girl emerges from the ashes.
 Best book ever written. And this company made it very easy to get. Thank you guys!
 A well-written and imaginative novel.  Thoroughly enjoyed it--even the unpleasantness of the holocaust was made to be tolerable and educational.  You won't regret the time spent reading this one!
 This is the audio version. The reader was a story teller, a true and first rate actor. The characters are engaging, the story beautiful and painful. I recommend this for anyone.
 I enjoyed the book, but found it a little longer than it should have been.  I thought it was somewhat repetitious in parts, particularly in respect to the ongoing relationship between the main character and mayor's wife , as well as, her boyfriend and other characters.
 This book is one for the times and a must read for children maybe 6th grade an up.  It's a lesson about NOT repeating history, kids!  This book is also appropriate for anyone 80+ years of age.  The writing style/voice is unique and catches you "thinking" every time the narrator comments on the state of humans and human nature.  Can't wait for the movie!
 A hard book to read but a beautiful writing of a horrific story that must be told!!  I love the courage, &amp; the triumph of the children. Also so glad to see the love &amp; understanding for The Book Thief. Who could deny anyone the chance to read, write, dream, escape?
 This will always be one of my favorite books. The story is moving and sad but also hopeful. I enjoyed it more than the movie. It is of course a book of life under Hitler with children at the heart of the book. Well written , lots of insight into what a child's life was like. Chilling circumstances for German families caught up in the war. You wonder why one war wouldn't be enough for the world but still we fight. However this is mainly a story about families and children who manage to have good moments along with the bad. I loved it , hope you will too.
 This was a very surreal yet captivating read. It was interesting that the narrator (Death) could intertwine the innocence of youth and the horrors of Nazi Germany during WWII. I was surprised that this book was classified as a "children's/youth" book. A very dark book for such a classification....
 I loved the way this story was crafted. I was a little confused at first trying to find out what person this was written in but it became clear quickly enough and thorough enjoyed it crying and smiling through out.
 I had never really thought about the innocent German citizens affected by the Holocaust. How there was so many of them that protected and hid Jewish citizens, risking their own lives and their lives of their families. This book made me really think about what would I have done if I had been German and living during these terrible times. Would I have stood up for what was right or would I have been too afraid of the Nazi regime and remained silent?
 I am learning to like quirky. I was just a bit thrown off during first 20 pages but I encourage any others to read past there and take in this wonderful story about Liesel and her foster family, friends and Death in Munich of Nazi Germany.
 One the best books I've read in a long time. The way it's written...from death point of view, is amazing. It's pure genius. The author is able to jump around from situation to situation so flawlessly, which is something a lot of authors don't do well. He tells this story in a way that makes you feel like the narrator is sitting right beside you. You can see the tired lines on his face. Hear the sadness in his voice. This is one for the ages folks. And one last note...have tissue ready for the ends folks.
 This story kept my attention from the very first page to the last.  it was so well written and I felt I knew each of the characters as if they were my own family and neighbors.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story.
 I liked this book even though it was so sad.  I liked that it was written from a completely different point of view of all others I read about WWII.  Mr. Zusak was so clever to write it as "Death" in first person.  When I chose "the Book Thief" I had no idea what it was about so the whole think was new and amazing to me.
 Fantastic book!! I absolutely loved this book, a movie was recently made as well and it does follow the book but the book has so much more to offer, not surprisingly. A must read!
 This was a very good read and I couldn't put it down. The subject matter was a bit tough, the holocaust seen through the eyes of children. There were some very tense moments and some very sad moments, but in the end, a very joyful conclusion.
 Markus Zusak is brilliant.  This story is about the average German citizen during WWII and their struggles dealing with the nightmare of the Holocaust while trying to just live their lives.  It is told from the unique perspective of the Grimm Reaper.  The characters are so well developed that by the end of the book you love each one of them including the narrator.  A well told story about some very real people.  I highly recommend this book.
 Life, death, humanity and inhumanity are all witnessed by Death and Liesel, a preteen girl who sees far too much in Germany's 1939-1943 warring world. Liesel gives us the story and the heartbreak, Death gives us facts, no matter how terrible.
 Loved it.  Checked it out from the library and read it and loved it so much saw the movie and had to buy a copy to own myself.  Markus Zusak is a very talented young author.  I have read most of his writings and look forward to more.
 Great book. There's a depth to it. The characters are people that I wish I could have known .... complex, sincere, innocent, strong and compassionate ... even Death, who narrates the story.
 Friends at work told me about this book and I was not disappointed. It was slow in the beginning, but I had difficulty putting the book down after I got started. The characters were so well written.
 I not sure if this is the best novel I ever read, but I'm sure it's in the top ten. The writing is almost poetry. A very different format, but very satisfying. I don't remember ever crying before while reading the final pages. Splendid!
 Read The Book Thief with our book club. We were blown away , agreeing it was one of the best books we've ever read. Loved the fresh coupling of adjectives and nouns, --so unusual, yet perfect.
 What a wonderful and emotional book. It made me smile and it made me cry.<br/>A note to the author, as a native German I noticed a few mis-spellings in the book that bothered me a little.
 A-OK.
 Different POV from most stories. Death develops the characters and tells of his soul gathering times during the buildup to WWII and beyond.  Lisa Menninger is the Book thief. Her story is wonderful.
 This was one of the most interesting books I have ever read.  I did not see the movie and really don't plan to.  Movies never live up to a great book.<br/><br/>Stick with it when you start, a little unnerving at first.
 Very well written. Such a captivating read...I wanted more.
 90% of books i start i do t finish. I dont have a lot of time and im picky.  I want a book that means something to me, but thats not torture to get through.  I couldnt put the book thief down, finished it in a weekend.  Fun characters, just the right amount of heavy.  It will be a classic.
 What incredible detail. Only once before have I read about the paper drop tanks. Bravo
 This book kept my interest from beginning to end. I love history and even though it is a novel put me in the time of living in Germany during Hitler's time.  I<br/>Highly recommend this book.
 It's a beautifully written story, with thoughtful, memorable characters and images that will stay with me. One of the most touching is the image of Death cradling the souls of the dead as he carries them away. What a fresh perspective on a sad time in history. It's a story for both young and old that I look forward to reading again.
 This is a moving story and sad. It showed the power words have to make you think about life and how circumstances are understood and influence our actions. A since of appreciation for books, love of family and friends make this book very special.
 This book gripped me right from the first page and it was hard to put the Kindle down.  It was more detailed than the film, especially from Death the narrator's viewpoint, and certainly showed life during WWII from the German civilians' side.  Very moving and brilliantly written.
 The book was in perfect condition. The story was haunting, compelling, perfect. Would highly recommend to anyone.
 You have to admit that the ending is excellent. It tells you that Hitlers and Hubermens and Maxes, and many others on the either end of the good and evil are still in our lives. It's very true. The humans will never change.
 My 13 year old and I read this together and loved it.
 Beautifullfy written, and very sad about a black time in our  lifetimes.  I am not done, yet, but will be soon.  I just do not know why this talented author wrote such a sad story,  Why?  Perhaps so we will never forget!
 I am just about finished with the book and I can tell you that I love it.  I remember well the days of this war.  I highly recommend this.  Although it is fiction it is educational and thought provoking.
 This book is absolutely riveting.  The style of writing is as if you are sitting and chatting with someone, telling you about incidents.  The descriptions are unbelievably phrased.  A beautiful, disturbing and powerful book.
 I couldn't put the book down, couldn't part with the characters, the warmth of their hearts amidst the devastating, bitter cold of the world they lived in.  Zusak's writing gripped me and wouldn't let go until I finished the book, leaving me wanting more words.
 Tremendous read, written with attention to the placement of each word, each punctuation - like a poem.  I wasn't sure if I liked the writing style at first, but I frequently find that if I persist, I am rewarded - this was great writing, a book that will live through the ages.
 Absolutely wonderful book.  Story explains the Nazi revolution from the perspective of the poor German people who wanted no part of Hitler's regime. I hope they do a good job with the movie.
 This book was amazing. I started to read it when I was younger, but didn't finish it. Now that I'm older, I'm glad I waited because I appreciate it so much more.
 The Book Thief is no light read. It's not meant to be taken to the beach or casually skimmed over during the course of a weekend. The fact that it's narrated by Death Himself should clue readers into the serious themes held within its pages. I admit that I had to be patient with the narrative at first -it seemed disjointed and difficult to get into, but the language was so vibrant and clever that the book wouldn't let me go. As a result, I was incredibly moved by the ending and can offer up the rarest praise: I will reread this book again in time. It is just that good, that powerful, and that important.
 I really enjoyed reading this book.  The author did a very good job of making you feel that you were there. During this horrible time.  Heart warming and sad at the same time.......
 This book, while poignant and sad sometimes is filled also with humor and creativity.  It "feels like" Zusak  captured what it must have been like to have been a child in a country that was so very unsafe and frightening at that time in history.
 Really good book that makes you think about what is important and how life is.  I highly recommend this book
 I love the narrative of this book. I read a lot. Well as much as a working mom with a 6 year old can and this is my new favorite book of all time. I originally resisted reading it because I didn't want to revist Nazi German. I felt like that topic had already been covered but I am so glad this book miraculously showed up on my kindle. Simply wonderful. Enjoy!
 The most beautifully written book I have ever read-and I read a lot. Zusak's command of the English language is jaw-droppingly brilliant on so many levels. The narration through the perspective of Death is geniously balanced so as to add a unique voice, without detracting from the other characters.<br/><br/>I would recommend to anyone. This piece should be required reading in schools-Junior High or High School.
 Read this for our book club.  Did not know what the plot really was beforehand and have not seen the movie yet.  It was really interesting and the characters came to life.  The subject matter is difficult, but i have already read much on the topic of the holocaust. I would recommend this book.
 At first, I thought that I would not like this book, but I gave it a chance and I am soooo glad that I did. This book now takes its place as my most favourite book. I laughed, I cried, and soon became Liesel. The descriptions are amazing, so it was easy to become Liesel.  I definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an amazing read. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.:)
 Amazing narration of a beautiful book. The words are woven so perfectly.
 I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF "THE BOOK THIEF" A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN LOOKING THROUGH REVIEWS ON AMAZON FOR A BOOK TO RECOMMEND FOR MY BOOK CLUB.  THE IDEA OF A BOOK NARRATED BY "DEATH" INTRIGUED ME.  THEY ACCEPTED MY RECOMMENDATION AND I BORROWED THE BOOK FROM THE LIBRARY, NOT SURE I WANTED  TO PURCHASE IT.  IT IS ONE OF THE MOST MOVING BOOKS WE HAVE READ.  I'VE SINCE BOUGHT A COUPLE OF COPIES FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN AND RECENTLY BOUGHT A COPY TO KEEP FOR MY OWN LIBRARY.  IT IS A MOVING STORY OF HOW THE ORDINARY GERMAN PEOPLE LIVED AND COPED DURING WORLD WAR II AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE EFFECT THE WAR HAD ON ADOLECENTS. WHILE IT IS CLASSIFIED AS A BOOK FOR YOUNG ADULTS, I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL TO GRANDPARENTS.
 This story was a referral from my 8th grade social studies teacher (I am in my 40s), and he was absolutely right. It's a very relevant book for any age, and even though it tells a story we've heard in Anne Frank's Diary or Number the Stars, it was written with a unique twist: it is told from the perspective of Death himself. And, you can't say that Hitler's Germany is a topic that has been exhausted. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop, and the size of the book made for a very happy reader who is used to finishing a book in two days as I had it around for a while due to its lengthy story and great details.
 I bought this book because of all the "I loved it coos" from colleagues and friends. For me "The Book Thief" took me on a bicycle ride. The start an easy and enjoyable coast into the set up of setting and characters. The middle hit an unexpected and hard going incline, at times I thought to myself "just hurry up and finish". By the end however I was glad I persisted as zusak ties the end up nicely. However predictable that such oppressed characters and the miserable clime of their times, suggested things would not get better for all involved. The narration  by "death" himself gave the story an unusual and complex spin.
 As avid book readers, we can all appreciate the power of a good book.  I enjoyed reading about the various relationships in this book and the point of view of the narrator.  I'm looking forward to watching the movie now.
 So realistic and touching. This book was truthfully a reality check for me. Such a good story..reminding you to not take for granted the things you have. I love that it came from the perspective of Death. My favorite line is found on page 357 " If only she could be so oblivious again, to feel such love without knowing it, mistaking it for laughter and bread with only the scent of jam spread out on top of it."
 Amzing book told from the angel of death's perspective
 This is a really good read. The E characters are well developed and the book is interesting and moves along.  I saw the movie by the same name after reading the book and I was glad I did, it gave the movie more depth.
 This book is definitely a 5 star.  The story narrator gives a genius touch to the times, circumstances and mystery of the era.  I recommend the  book to all ages however, middle school children should be familiar with World War II documentary in order to appreciate and understand as the story unfolds.
 Excellence in every way.
 What a great compassionate story.  Something like the Diary of Ann Frank except it is a glimpse of the German people's plight during WWII.  It gave me a feeling of more sensitivity to the German race during that time as in the past I had hostile feelings toward their nonreaction to the Jewish situation or I should say, suffering.  They had a lot of hardship during Hilters reign.
 Definitely one of my favorite books! I bought it on my Kindle, but plan to one day buy the physical book! Great style of writing. I was doubtful at first because I realized the story was told from the perspective of Death, but it proved to be an amazing work of literature! If you're considering this book right now, absolutely get it. You won't be sorry.
 It is a sad book, detailing life during the second world war.
 One of the things I love more about this book is the beautiful images it has. This is like reading poetry for me. I may buy the paper book as well to put besides my bed and have the pleasure of opening it random and read again and again the images. Victoria
 This was a<br/><br/> wonderfully sad and powerful book.  The writing is absolutely lovely and haunting at the same time.  I was surprised by the imagery. I read a lot of books and this was by far the best I have read in a long time.
 While the story line for this WW II was standard the approach of narration by Death was unusual.  The characters were presented in a very human way without the entire story being dominated by the book thief despite the title.  It was so well done I was surprised that only within the last few months was I even aware of its existence even though I have read extensively about WW IIthe plight of the characters, and the fate of the Jews during the war notwithstanding I found the book highly enjoyable.
 Hard to read the terrible times that the Nazi's put people through, but important to remember these things did happen. The human spirit to survive, be brave and deal with the terror that was inflicted brings so much respect for them.
 This is a wonderful story, told from an interesting point of view. I won't give any spoilers but the story of The Book Thief" is truly captivating. All of the characters are brought to life and I had a hard time putting this book down. I loved it!
 Of course the story is fascinating. This was my first experience with a Kindle or any type of electronic reader. I don't enjoy using them but this in no way reflects on the service or the book. It's just me.
 Although this has been made into a movie, and I strongly recommend the movie, read this book first! It gives details that are left out in the movie, although the movie is, for the most part, true to the book. Strongly recommend!
 Much less depressing that I thought  it would be. A touching look at how people survived, adapted and supported/<br/>protected each other. Highlights the difficulty of being true to your inner good ness while in the middle if an evil that many feared<br/>or colluded with for  survival. The source of a lot of survivor guilt and soulsearching and even regrets. I'm still sad for all the losses incurred of those I'd come to like and even cherish.
 WHAT A GREAT STORY!!  THE NARRATOR WAS FANTASTIC AND ONLY OVERSHADOWED BY THE AMAZING STORY LINE
 This is one time I am glad that I saw the movie before reading the book. The writing filled out the story. The details brought out concerning war time Germany and life during the war are enlightening if somewhat depressing. Life went on regardless of the insanity of war. Will we ever learn?
 I bought this based solely on the number of positive reviews. Typically that doesn't work for me since I have fairly specific taste in books normally. The reviews were right about this one though!  Glad I read it.
 A very unusual, painful book.  A haunting story I expect to remember  Wonderful characters and a clear look at hardships of ordinary German people during World War II.
 Such a good book, the perspective it was written from is brilliant and make sure you have a box of tissues near by for the end. I was on my way to work listening to the end and thankfully was not wearing any makeup.
 What a book. I was captivated from page 1. Beautifully written , full of compassion, a wonderful "other " side to the story of the war. I would recommend this book greatly.
 My 14 year old needed this book for school but after the first 30 pages or so he was complaining that the class was moving too slow and he had to read ahead.
 This was an amazing book - amazing for the style in which it was written - amazing for how moving and real the story made me, as the reader, feel.  I have been recommending it to everyone with whom I discuss literature.  It was even more amazing, I guess, because I happen to be reading it around the time of the Holocaust commemoration this year (2014).
 very moving story  it started a tad slow for me, but by the end I did not want it to end. I have read many other books in that era but this is far and above my favorite
 I love how it's written, I love how I can understand the German words (I am German), I love the story.  Not sure if I like the sudden ending of the book - I was wanting to read more and more.
 It's a book you can read quickly start to finish.  It covers all the bases - happy, sad, set-up for ending that you don't realize but makes sense.  It skirts the edges of what's really going on in Germany, but if you know - you can fill in the gaps yourselves.  Just a good book.
 Bought for my classroom.
 I don't normally buy or read war books, but this one caught my eye.  It wasn't a book that I "couldn't put down", but I gave it five stars just for that reason--I had to keep putting it down because the writing kept getting to me in a way that I had to keep taking breaks from the intensity of it all.  It made me think of war in a way that, even days after finishing it, I keep almost desperately clinging to my husband and children.  I gave it the five stars because the writing and the casual presence of war in the book scares the s*** out of me.
 I enjoyed the book, but I felt like it was very slow moving at times and found it very difficult to get through. While I am glad that I powered through it I do not think it will be a book I will ever revisit.
 My mother-in-law, born in Frankfurt am Main, lived in Nazi Germany. She was in the Hitler Youth (not really by choice) and experienced the war beginning to end. She has stories like staying in her basement and eating potato peelings because food was short. I couldn't put this book down.
 I enjoyed the way this book was written.  You could read a chapter quickly and put it down and pick it up again to read somethng else.  I never thought about the people in Germany not liking Hitler or being afraid themselves.  Very interesting historical perspective. I wish it would have told if the girl ended up marrying Max.
 Good storytelling about Germany leading up to and during World War II.  The poor girl left to a strange family for protection, the Jew who is hidden in the cellar, he Nazi Youth, the Mayor's wife --- all are carefully depicted and believable,  A great read!
 A story of hope, hope dashed and hope renewed. Simply great! Of the historical fiction that I have read of this period, this one will stick with me the most.
 I loved this book. I am now sad that I finished and that I won't get to see these characters every day!<br/>This is a wonderful piece about building relationships and the power of love and caring in a tumultuous time.<br/>If I could give 10 stars, I would! Enjoy!
 It was a little slow getting started and I was a bit distracted by the narrator at first but this story is something that will stay with me a long time. I loved it and hated it at the same time, much like our Book Thief felt about words. Don't miss this book.
 Read this book in record time.  Loved the story, flow of the contents.  What a great writer.<br/>Generally, I like to read the book and then see the movie but it was reverse this time.  Either way, I thoroughly enjoyed both.
 Wow!  This young author is a stupendous talent.  This book evokes many different emotions...and should be on any high school curriculum.  Its easy to read.  Very challenging content.  And, above all,  uplifting.
 Fascinating story with death as the narrator, but a young girl as the hero.  Sounds morbid, but it is anything but.  Wonderful moments of joy, learning, caring, humor all happening in a small town in Germany during World War II.
 A book club read - I was hesitant to read a narrative by Death himself - and I put the book down a few times in the very beginning ... But as the characters took shape and background story emerged - it was difficult to put down. What a heartwarming story in so many ways even with the backdrop of Nazi Germany and all of the sad events noted. This is a new all time favorite read ...
 This was one of those books I would not have chosen, my granddaughter recommended it and I am very glad she did. The style and language of the story were different and for me, interesting. I would like to encourage anyone to experience this storytelling.
 Ordered for my grandson's high school language arts project. Read &amp; rated by my grandson, 14. He loved it!
 The book captured the horrors of Nazi Germany and how it effected so many innocent lives.  Zusak's choice of descriptive words was unlike any that I've seen in other books.  It definitely held my attention.
 Enjoyed!
 I sent this to my 83 y/o  French mother and she said it was a beautiful book and she cried due to the emotions it brought up. She was a child in France when Hitler came through Paris. The movie is good too but the book's writing is excellent.
 When reading this book for class during the holocaust learning period I was not sure what to expect, as I thought that the emotional train wreck from books was over. But as I read the final pages of this book I realised that as long as there are amazing authors such as Mr. Zusak emotions will never stop being released. As a student I highly recommend this book to grades higher than 9th, or at least a class mature enough to handle lump sums of emotions being forced out from within.
 An unlikely narrator takes you through the tough times in Nazi Germany as Hitler rises to power.  Often you see the same story told of a Jewish character, but rarely one of Germans resisting the Nazi regime.  Characters that remind me of my neighborhood as a child, I got very attached to several of them.  Honestly at a loss for words to describe this novel because there are so many things I loved about it.  You'll just have to experience it for yourself.  Recommending it to anyone looking for a good read.
 It's a sad story, but don't let that deter you from reading it.  Most stories set in Nazi Germany will be sad.  I was drawn to the main character as she survived each obstacle set in her path.  I was glad that the book ended on a positive note.
 I loved this book.  The most fascinating aspect was the narrator who took the characters through the war years.  The characters were well developed, the author painted good, readable scenes.  I would recommend it to anyone--young and not so!
 It was a difficult but rewarding book to read.  A thoughtful historical novel that lives in your memory long after you've read it.
 This was a really great book. I loved the characters and the story lines. It was touching and wonderful. It's a nice look into a small portion of life in that time in Germany. I also love the perspective this book is written in.
 Loved the descriptive writing style and a look st Nazi Germany from a child's eyes. Didn't love the angel of death but did like the third person narrative
 One of the most original books I've read in a long time. I love the voice, the characters and even when heartbreaking, it was a joy to read.
 This is truly one of the best books I've ever read and is, without question, the only book that has caused me to weep.  The perspective of narration is incredibly well done and author makes it difficult to put this book down, even when your eyes are so heavy you fight to keep them open.
 This is a great book from a different venue than I usually choose to read.  It is a little disconnected and sometimes hard to follow but very heartrending.  There are some happy moments but mostly a sad reality of a very difficult period of time.
 Excellent read! Found the story engrossing and well written.  Highly recommended.
 I loved this book!  The movie was coming out and I always try to read the book BEFORE seeing the movie.  The movie is always less than the book.  This one has to be one of my favorites.  I recommended it to all my peeps.
 It's hard to describe this book without giving it away, which I will not do.  The author's writing is perfectly descriptive. Further it's educational, it tells us a lot about Germany during that time in history without boring us to death. I'll be sending this book to my family.
 This book was told from the perspective of the grim reaper. It is set in Germany in the early 40's and it visits the people in the life of the main character and book thief, Liesel. The characters are well defined and engrossing. This was a difficult book to put down.
 It was a very clever viewpoint from which to tell the story of life in Germany during WWII.  The story showed both the horror of of the war for those suffering under Hitler's regime, and the resilience of the human spirit. Very touching.
 A superb book, the foundation of a great movie.  Tells the story of a survivor of persecutions of WWII German citizens through the eyes of a ten year old growing up in the period.  At times, the story is emotionally draining, but worth the read.
 A must read. Not your typical holocaust story.  The author is Australian. His Mother grew up in Munich and he has successfully woven her experiences into this wonderful piece of fiction.
 Book Club choice.  If I had known what the book was about, I would never have chosen it.  But the more I read, the more I wanted to read until I couldn't put it down. It's a very interesting style. So much sadness for so many people.  Trickles of happiness and curiosity keep you going.
 I listened to this book 3 times. Although it is a fiction it describes a time in history which was unbelievably cruel. I thought that the idea of death telling the story was pretty good. You feel like you actually know these characters.
 A real, captivating story that will make you smile, laugh, hurt, and cry all at the same time. This book’s gorgeous narration and gut wrenching character development make it well worth the read.
 Good summertime read
 Humans survivor stories during the war and how the help each other or hinder one another. Also how their true spirit shows in the end. Strange writing style, a bit hard to follow at the beginning, but ties together. Sad like any goodbyes are.
 I love this book!  Have bought a few copies to give away.  It just moved me, can't properly explain why.
 Purchased for school.  Great book
 The narration was at first confusing but ultimately added a lot to the story. The brutality, and then also the tenderness and resiliency of the human condition were beautifully portrayed.
 Gorgeously written and cleverly narrrated, The Book Thief sets the reader down on a street in Nazi Germany, a village named Molching near the city of Munich. We experience Nazi Germany through the eyes of Death, the narrator of the book, and a young girl named Liesel Meminger, who arrives unwillingly at the door of a house on Himmel (Heaven) Street of reasons she is not quite sure of. We know that she has lost a father, that her mother is unable to care for her, and that her six year-old brother dies on a train before they were able to reach her new foster parents on Himmel Street.<br/><br/>While beautifully written and mesmerizing, reading the Book Thief is like sitting down with an ADHD-challenged friend and listening to him (Death seems masculine here, for some reason), tell you a story.  Unable to help himself, Death jumps around, blows endings, and gets distracted by his own prose quite easily. Death takes the reader through Nazi Germany and shows us the humanity that is left in spite of the inhumanity that we are already so familiar with.  Here's an often overlooked fact: not all Germans in Nazi Germany were Nazis.<br/><br/>We follow Liesel's childhood.  What could have turned out to be an incredibly painful childhood with the disappearance of her parents and the death of her six-year old brother during a major world war turns out to be a fairly happy existence employed as a well-respected player in the ever present street soccer games and an occasional thief of books and food.  Though seemingly perpetually hungry, Liesel grows to love her foster parents, even her foul-mouthed foster mother who occasionally beats her with a wooden spoon and calls her (and everyone else) "saukerl" or "saumensch."  Pig.  Pigman.  Her barely educated foster father teaches her how to read (Liesel is nine when we meet her), and rescues her from the almost constant nightmares she experiences about the death of her brother.  Liesel steals her first book, "The Gravedigger's Manual," from a hapless apprentice gravedigger who buries her brother, and it is this book that her foster father reads to her every night and eventually uses to teach her how to read.  Books (for poor people anyway) are difficult to come by in Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>Markus hauntingly captures the fear and depression of the German people during the bombings of their cities and villages.  Death, ever present, collects their stories (sometime literally as in Liesel's case), and  tells them wistfully to the reader.
 My son had to read this book for summer reading fast delivery. He wnjoyed the book
 if you are looking for well crafted story with an interesting perspective. you must read the book thief.  death, the narrator, tells the story of a young girl in nazi germany that is saved (literally) by books.  zusak shows, both with the book's plot and his command of language, how important words can be.  a must read.
 my niece loved the book thief and tells everyone to read it.
 It took me a long time to get into the way this book was written - in fact I never did really get used to it, but keep plugging away and by the end was so glad I had persisted.  I didn't see the movie but am glad I read the book.
 Oh my goodness. I can't begin to describe how much I love this book. On a first date when I'm breaking the ice and talking about favorite books, movies, tv, etc; I make sure to mention The Book Thief. It's that good.
 At first I was not sure how I was going to like this book. The way he wrote it took some time for me to get used to, but I am so glad that I decided to continue on. Such a good read! I highly recommend this book to everyone!
 This tale gives another look at the Germans and the sadness of this tragic war. The Narrator is a unique and unforgettable way to tell the story.  I will remember this one!
 I found this book to be full of interesting, likable characters. Who knew Death could be such a charming narrator? I also enjoyed the insights into the experiences of the German populace during the war.  Bravo for raising the subject.
 I enjoyed this book tremendously - it made me laugh as well as cry - such good writing and a remarkable conversation piece with perfect strangers when they saw what I was reading.  I didn't hear one critical remark from anybody.
 This is an incredibly moving story, about Hitler's Germany narrated by death, who's perspective is both unique and yet human. Great character development and supurb interaction among characters.
 Unique point of view a quirky narration and an enduring love story. The ending is purely the definition of bittersweet, so much that it's hard to see the extent of the beauty or the pain of the Book Thief.
 The Book Thief was interesting, informative, and full of emotion. Death being the narrator gave a new insight into how humans live. Thinking about how the German people lived through WWII under the thumb of Hitler reminded me of what Syrians, Iranians, and Egyptians are going through today. I would recommend it to everyone 15 years old and up.
 Told from a very interesting perspective. You really want things to turn out one way, but it's like real life, and things happen that you wish didn't. I love the way the story is told and the different aspects of the characters are expressed.
 Loved it though it took me about 2 chapters to not wanting to put the book down. The characters were so real that I felt I was one of them, living with them. Loved it and recommend it..
 Excellent book, beautifully written and moving.  I have recommended this book to others and it was recommended to me.  You really come to care about the characters.  Can't say enough about this book, it was one I hated to finish.
 I have to say that I usually don't like war time stories but this one was different.  I loved the narrative by death, it gave such a different viewpoint.  I would highly recommend this book to everyone, especially if you have a love of reading.
 This book was incredible! I laughed and I cried. I read it in a day. It confused me at the start! I didn't really know where it began. The story is being told by death. Once I got that, it was easier to read the book. Idk why. Anyhoo, the book is wonderful.
 For anyone who likes to read about Nazi Germany,this is a must read.  The narrator was Death which gives a very different slant to a topic which has been written about extensively.  The main character was a person anyone could love. The book seemed to drag in a few places.
 A beautifully written, touching story.  Forget the whole young adult thing, this book is for everyone.
 Really enjoyed this book!  I felt this book was very interesting and helped me understand some of the things that happened to the people who were in Germany during the Hitler regiem!
 I read this book with one of my seniors who was not interested in reading it.  I could not put this book down.  The clips from the movie enhanced what I just read.  I have not sobbed so hard as I did at the end.
 I enjoyed this book very much. The style of writing is a bit unique, which made it interesting and the characters were strongly identified so as to feel for each one of them strongly, in a way that only a good writer can accomplish.
 Really enjoyed this book!  Very interesting twist having Death be the narrator.  I did not find it overly sad, more informative.  Could really picture the scenes in the book.  Definitely recommend!
 Great book!  So touching and detailed.  Very well written from death's perspective, sheds light on humanity's good and evil.  Perfect read before watching the movie.  Shared with adolescent daughter as well as with friends (adults).  Appropriate for both.
 I wanted to read before I saw the movie, and am glad I did.  Character development is the high point.  I liked the narrative from the viewpoint of the grim reaper.  I will reread in the future and  get what I missed the first time.
 To write a story around the events of WWII from the viewpoint of death was hauntingly beautiful. And while I always appreciate a unique story that focuses on the Hitler Germany and The Holocaust, this is one of the few that really create unbiased people who were helpless to circumstance. As a Jew, I have a hard time reading novels or historical accounts from German perspective that excuses the accounts of WWII. However making Death the narrator didn't merely make everyone sympathetic in the story, it also made them humanly accountable.
 Although predictable, it was a good read.  My only complaint was the fact that it IS so predictable, but mostly because the narrator warned the reader about events that were going to occur.  While it wouldn't have been difficult to guess most of it, I wonder if the regular confirmation from the author was really necessary.
 What a story teller! I am so grateful to the many people who recommended this beautiful book. Feeling enriched for taking the time.
 I started to read this book because it was  the monthly book club selection. Part way through I fell in love with the characters and literally couldn't put it down. I finished the book, laughing and crying and feeling that I will never be the same.
 I don’t think I’ve ever read a book that has made me feel so much at one time. It’s terribly sad book in the most beautiful and pure way
 The author's style of writing is so appealing and by the looks of the movie editions, they have done a fine job of maintaining the integrity of the book. I am looking forward to seeing the movie...as soon as I finish the book!
 At almost 70, I was determined to read this book!  My step granddaughter at age 13 was reading it for a school recommend book.  This book illustrates beautifully a time in our history when humanity was at it's worst and ar our best!  The book is a story of families living during the most difficult and evil of times, and yet they had unparalleled strength that sometimes is awakened by evil!
 This was a required summer reading for my daughter. I review all her books, and like others I do not understand how schools will punish my children for using language they are required to read. That being said, besides the profanity, I enjoyed this book.
 My daughter enjoyed the ebook but wanted hard copy for book report.
 I have read this book several times. It's beautiful and deep. Maybe a little dark for young adults, but definitely worth a read.
 I would certainly recommend this book to any teenager and adults alike. I was used to reading stories about the Third Reich from the view of a Jewish person, so this book drew me in by having another point of view, from the other side of it all. There was a poetic tone to the book and it left me thinking, exactly what a book should do. I was a little put off by death's narration. I just wasn't sure what ot make of it. Was it cliche, or an author's genius? It did seem more cliche, though. But all-in-all, a fantastic novel filled with bold writing choices.
 This was the first book I ever read by Markus Zusak. He's such a phenomenal writer! After I finished reading this, a few years ago, I went out and purchased three of his other books.
 this was a great read! cant wait to see the movie. this grabbed me right from the beginning and i couldn't put this book down until i reached the end! i was so connected to the family . i felt i was a part of them.
 This was a simple, moving and great story.  I think especially for those of us born in the 1940s'.  Even though the American childhood was different, it is easy to relate to the parenting,playing and poor circumstances of the times.
 Came in good condition. The story can be very slow, but has very fleshed out characters and you grow on them. Plenty of emotional moments
 Favorite book(:
 Took a while but my niece finished it.  It was summer reading at school.  Quite interesting!
 I saw the movie first and then bought the book.  Its a lovely story and portrays Nazi Germany through a child's eyes and the eyes of Death.  Its whimsical, happy, and sad.  This is a great read!
 The configuration of his writing style, plot and overall theme of the book truly make it a must read. I would highly recommend it, this book gave me shivers and brought me to tears, once again I would highly recommend.
 I wanted to read this book before the movie...  It was an amazing book!  I'm a picky reader, and a book really has to keep my attention for me to finish it.  This one did it.  Definitely would recommend it.
 I don't know what I expected from this book but it totally exceeded my expectation. I liked the storyline and the characters. It was an easy read, though it was about WWII. I'd recommended this book.
 This is one of the best books I have read in a while. Make sure you check this book out...and give it a chance. The beginning was a little slow - but I promise once you get into it, you won't be able to put it down!
 I enjoy historical fiction novels.  This is a good one giving lots of insight into early Nazi Germany and the way the citizens of that time had to act in order to be safe.  I also shows what bravery was in the face of personal danger.
 This was one of those books that was hard to put down, and hard to forget.  It's the story of a young girl, growing up in Nazi Germany, who discovers the power of words, to both heal and wound.  The story is narrated by Death, which gives the book a unique twist.
 My 4th time (at least) reading this book, and despite leaving me in utter ruin, I always pick it up again every once in awhile looking for more.
 The only reason I didn't give The Book Thief five stars is that it took me a while to get into the style of writing. The book is a first person narrative from the voice of death. Once I got rolling with the style I found myself drawn to the characters. The strength it must have taken to stand up for personal beliefs in the face of the Nazi movement was so well written. This is a recommended read.
 Loved it!  Book was required summer reading for granddaughter who read it to ME during our long drives over the summer.  Double blessing.
 I was a little girl during this time of History, and the book brought back memories of what was said during these dark days.  The way Hitler had the final say in everything.  I could see myself as Liesel, with Papa, Mama, Rudy and of course Max the Jew whom I too loved.<br/><br/>I laughed and cried with them all...so true to life, I must read it again.  This will be one of my favorite books of all time.<br/><br/>Thank you for bringing this wonderful book to us.  May we never forget!!!<br/><br/>Sincerely,  Adriane
 I cannot say enough good things about this book....  I tend to get bored with books very easily, and have a hard time seeing them to the end because of it.  I was so excited when I found myself totally unable to put this down!  It had me laughing and crying...<br/>I really love that it was written from Death's perspective, because it was such a unique way to take in this wonderful story.  So much love and compassion in this story; leaves you with so much more of an appreciation for family, friends, love, and precious life itself.<br/>Thank you so much Markus Zusak....you've made a life-long impression!
 This is such a beautifully written story, I highly recommend it.  I couldn't put it down!  I haven't seen the movie, so it was all new.
 This is the first Zuzak novel I have read and it this is the standard indication of the man's ability to tell a story I will be reading everything he writes! I found the narrative fresh and beguiling -  the way the chapters and story were laid out were so intriguing. Most fiction leaves me wanting something more at the end of the book, or else has me picking at things as I'm reading - stilted dialogue or whatever - not this one. Truly, a most satisfying read. Loved it. From beginning to end.
 This is one of those books you hate to see end.  Very interesting writing style - quite good.  The story tells about the horrors of World War II, with a look at what the German population experienced, as well as the suffering of the Jewish people.
 Out of the many fiction books I've read lately, this is the only one to really stick with me. I think of it as a new classic and I think kids and adults will both love it. It's a very beautiful, well-written story. And, yes, the movie is pretty good too.
 this book is exceptional in that the story is narated by death,  through the eyes of a child.  the setting is WW2 in Germany.<br/><br/>not what i expected, however i couldn't put the book down until the end.
 In spite of Death as the narrator, which bothered me very much (along with the "colors" of the deaths), at the beginning, I soon came to be engrossed in the fate of Liesel.  I have led discussions of this book with two book clubs and it has been a favorite with everyone.  Tears were shed and we missed Liesel and Rudy for weeks after reading it.
 When I first started reading this book, I did not like the narrator and never did warm up to that part of the book. However, the story drew you in and the child's bravery and ability to embrace life holds your heart through the book.
 One of the best books I've ever read.  A very sad story but told from a fascinating view point and the pictures that the author drew with his words were works of art.
 At first I was not sure I liked this book.  The beginning was confusing with the unusual point of view, but as I got to know the characters it started to make sense to me, so I went back and reread it. You may need to do this, too!  Even toward the end, the point of view would surprise me.  I know this is being made into a movie and am interested in how they will depict this.
 Summer reading project
 Everything a great book should be and more.<br/><br/>This book was a wonderful read. A little slow in the uptake, but once I dove deeper and associated myself to the mulit-dimensional characters and the 1940's, I was transformed back into an era that was so controversial and unfair to so many.<br/><br/>I'll be renting the movie next.
 I was I thrilled by the beauty of this book! I have never read anything like it. Poetic and beautifully written, it touches your soul. I highly recommend it.
 I honestly believe that this was the best books I have ever read. A beautiful and touching story that brought a smile to my lips and tears to my eyes. I bought this book from audible and found that the choice of the narrator also enriched the story. A big thumbs up to the author. Thank you for taking me to Nazi Germany and into the life of Himmel Street. Please everyone read this beautiful book.
 I realize this book has been on the best sellers list for so long for a reason but I was still surprised by how it affected me. I will never forget these characters and I must say I am very fond of Death now.
 This book gives a picture of WW2 in a German neighborhood, how could a single person act against the Reich and stay alive?  The entire family took a huge risk but the benefit was that they kept their sense of decency and humanity.
 The Book Thief is an amazing work of art. The writing is accessible and lyrical at the same time, and what a surprising POV. I was completely drawn into the story. No spoilers -- read this one yourself. Highest recommendation.
 I honestly hate reading, I am more of a Math person. This book however was so good that I actually had a hard time putting it down.
 A lovely story of a young girl coming of age in Nazi Germany.
 This is one of my favorite books and one I continue to recommend to others! The characters are beautifully well-developed and though the overall setting and many incidents are terribly sad, somehow it all becomes endearing, I guess because it pulls at your heartstrings so. A favorite insight I'm not likely to forget soon was when Death, the narrator, explains that the young soldiers are not running towards each other, they are "running towards me".
 I really didn't like the way this book was written.  I didn't really understand it at first and when I did, I really didn't care for it.  The writing was okay, but I didn't care for the voice it was written in and I gave up finishing it after I read about 25% of it.
 I will read this book again.  Second time through brings out more insight into the history and people.
 I have never read this type of fiction before so I scratched my head a little as I made it through the first few chapters.  But I came to really love the characters and even respected the narrator, death, by the end.  Great read but be prepared to take a little time to digest the story.
 There are already so many thoughtful, thorough reviews about this book that I feel a need to keep my comments brief.  I loved The Book Thief, from the clever narrator to the emotionally compelling plot.  A fab read.
 I loved this book.  Buy it.<br/>Savor every page.<br/>It's a beautiful book.  I just wish I had saved it for a plane ride.<br/>That would have made the time just fly.<br/>Truly, I was sad to get to the end of the book.
 Enjoyed the concept of a day in the life of an average German family in wartime Germany.  Especially dealing with the many interpersonal relationships presented in the book. Captures your attention from the narrator perspective of the angel of death.
 My favorite book
 I really liked this story and I think the film will be excellent. I did find though that I could not read Max's writings and pictures on my kindle which was a bit of a shame. I loved the ending with kieselguhr living to a ripe old age.
 For all the excitement, I thought it was just average. Had hoped to see the movie, but after reading this, we didn't go. Very little involvement or engagement with the girl--the thief.
 I agree with the reviewer who said:  "Different, entertaining, and heartbreaking."  I am glad I read it, and I still think about parts of it and shudder at the thought that it happened in many forms at a time in our human history.
 More than a war story. Not merely a coming of age saga. A fresh take on the horrors of war told from an unique perspective. Zusak expresses his images in a surprising and lyrical manner from an unusual point of view. He touches emotions but doesn't become sentimental.
 This book was written in such a fresh new way from the metaphors it uses to the unique point of view of the narrator. I didn't like the repetitive foreshadowing but overall it was a great read and I really enjoyed it
 The father, Hans, is a wonderfully crafted father figure! He is the highlight. Beyond him, I don't think I found the author's style of writing to be to my liking and I didn't fall in love with the remaining characters. I deleted it after finishing it...I won't be reading it again.
 I did enjoy the book very much, even though the subject matter was very depressing &amp; disturbing.  I liked that it was told from death as the third party.  It is a book that our Book Club will be discussing at our next meeting.  I look forward to the discussion!
 Loved this book! the use of Death as the narrator i found added an interesting layer to the book - an added character that sometimes invoked an emotional response! I thought the characters were well fleshed out and  the story moved along easily. I had started reading this just before the release of the movie so I kept imagining Geoffrey Rush in the role of Hans - which of course was really not a problem. Would definitely recommend this book!
 This is a story in words about words.  A beautiful story in beautiful words.  How can a movie show "somewhere inside her were the souls of words.  They climbed out and stood beside her."  To be read slowly so you can see the colors and feel the words.
 This is one of those books you don't want to continue reading but you have to. There's beauty in the sadness and so much sweet and sour. I just couldn't stop crying for most of it and I loved it.
 Love historical fiction and this one is a real keeper.  I don't say this often, but this is the second book lately I would likely read again.  The subtlety of this book makes me wonder what I may have missed on the first read.
 This book was phenomenal. It is outside of my usual genre selection, but I couldn't put it down. It creates such a beautiful story and resonates such a tried and true message that the human race needs to remember, words are both beautiful and disgusting. Definitely worth the read! The way it is written is different than most books, but give it a chance because the story is worth it.
 I read this book out of curiosity. Still not sure why it got such high ratings in the book world. I really cant say it is a must read.<br/>It's an 'okay' book. No lessons learned.
 This is a brilliant piece, written in the voice of the angel of death.<br/>I love how the author gives you an inkling. Of what's to come at the beginning of the section and then expands on it.<br/>The characters seem like friends.
 Great story.
 The first couple of pages are reminiscent of a Faulkner novel, so I was a little unsure initially, but ‘The Book Thief’ is a great read.  Viewing WWII from the German side was an interesting experience and the writing is fantastic.
 Great book would recommend to all, one of my favorites, did not buy this book at first, thought it was for young adults but after hearing all the reviews decided to read it and am glad I did
 A most amazing recount of what it was like to live at that time.  In addition to being a book for young adults, it should be a book that everyone reads.
 I read this book and learned so much about war and love that I'll be forever changed. I am shaken.
 This may well have been the most beautifully written book that I've read in years.  The story is compelling and the narrative is absolutely exquisite.  This novel should be listed and marketed as adult fiction.  The "young adult" categorization will turn some readers away and it will be their loss.  Do not pass this one up.
 This story was captivating from the first page. I do not know how this story could be told any other way. It is for eclectic readers. I am looking forward to seeing the movie.<br/><br/>James Douglass<br/>Garden City, Kansas
 This is one of the best books I have ever read. I do not get emotional in stories, but I almost cried. As an author, the complexity of the storytelling and the fullness of the plot are really inspiring. To take something like World War Two and turn it into ana amazing, heartfelt story like this is truly awe inspiring. I recommend this to any and everyone.
 The book is great, as everyone knows. My Kindle did not allow me to avail myself of the enchancements - in the event that I overlooked helpful information on the web site that would have revealed this and allowed me to purchase an "unenhanced" version, then we can put this down as user error.
 I read the book first, then saw the movie.<br/>The book was denfinately better.<br/>At first it was unclear who was telling the story but<br/>after you realize it's "Death" things make more sense.<br/>A good read.
 What an amazing story! I just couldn't stop reading it, the characters were so believable. It made me realise that in life we meet others, we have different relationships with each. And yet those relationships have purpose and meaning. There is something to be learned from The Book Thief - life is fragile and opportunities too are must not be deferred or regret may sully our memories.This is an incredible read.
 A little hard to like near the beginning but very thought provoking and close to the heart as one reads on.  Hopefully we will continue to learn from history and never repeat the hateful mistakes of that time.  May we aslo learn that heroism is often small caring gestures made often.
 Startlingly brilliant from beginning to end. Best book I have read in years...hands down! I highly recommend this book but be prepared as it is an emotional ride of epic proportions!
 This is by far the best book I have ever read.  I never re-read a book, even a very good one, but this one speaks to me as I am sure it will to you. I just finished it for the second time and I am considering starting over.
 You have to read this book.  It is by far the most compelling book I've read in a long time. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a great book that isn't about some far-fetched love story gone wrong.
 This book is so sad and beautiful. It is hard to imagine how a movie will at all capture the gorgeousnesss of the authors multi colored  breathing words. You could watch the movie of the book thief but you have to read the book to actually see it.
 I enjoyed reading The Book Thief as it is a point of view from a young German girl.  Normally, books regarding The Holocaust is told from Jewish viewpoint.  Naturally, the book is quite sad, as it takes place in Nazi dominated Germany and WWII.  However, there is a happy ending for the young girl who narrates the story.  This book reveals that not ALL Germans agreed with The Third Reich.
 Bought this book for my grandson's school assignment over this summer and he is really enjoying it!
 The Book Thief is narrated by Death and provides a fascinating perspective on Nazi Germany and the Holocast.  The main characters are complex and the story is riveting.  I haven't seen the movie, but the book is hard to put down.
 I love this book and think everybody should read it. The Book Thief' s about ten year old German girl Liesel Meminger. She live  in Nazi German. The book begins a year or so before World War Two starts. Shortly into that period, Liesel's foster father Hans starts to hide Max Vandenburg: the Jewish Fist Fighter.
 I was initially drawn to this book because I love historical fiction. When I realized who the narrator of the story is, I was sucked in and couldn't put it down until I had finished the last word.<br/>What a fascinating idea of what our world must look like to someone who is privy to some of the most horrible aspects of the human condition. And yet in the midst of one of the darkest eras in human history is a story of determination, bravery, love, and kindness.
 This was an amazing book, from the German's perspective and the impact that terrible war had on their own society, I would recommend this book to anyone.
 One of the great books of life.  Should be read by all as the story is so full of life's lessons.  It has heart and makes on think about the world and how we should be treating each other with kindness and thoughtfulness.  It is so uniquely written and beautiful as you go from page to page reading this story.
 This was a page-turner for me. Loved how it presented the lives of this fictional German family and its response to the Nazi takeover and persection of Jews. It had some interesting side-characters, too.
 I give this item 4 stars because is a book and books deserve ALWAYS a lot of stars, but, I really don't like much the material in which they made the paper, it smells like a newspaper, I really enjoy the smell of new books, but not in this case =(
 Long read
 I bought this because I saw a preview of the movie. The story was great and well written. I would recommend it to anyone. Very touching story of a young girl and her foster family during a rough time in history. Can't wait to see the movie version.
 This book draws you in, from the start, and does not let you go, even after reading it's final passage. Not many books expose human nature as well as this one does. Wonderful  and thought providing, as all great works of art should be.
 Loved this book from the first page.  The characters were engaging.  The writing was lyrical.  It was difficult to put down at times.  That the narrator was Death made for an interesting perspective.  It is a story of both loss and survival.
 This book was very difficult to put down once started. I had seen the movie before reading, but that just whetted my appetite. I did enjoy the book very much.
 Not the kind of story I expected, but it served its purpose for my children whose choice for a Lit class in school was to read this book.
 I choose this rating because I am often disappointed  after hearing so much about a book, but in this case I am totally in awe<br/>of anyone who survived the Holocaust. This book makes my heart cry for those who were lost.
 I learned so much from this book about this time period. It is heart wrenching to explore life during such  a tragic time through such real characters. The characters are thoughtful and their stories are thought-provoking. This book is uniquely and beautifully written, leaving a feeling of hope that shines from the resilient human spirit.
 It is written very differently being in the words of death speaking.  It is very descriptive and really makes you think about how Hitler's decisions affected both the Jew's and the poor German people.  It shows how love and a strong will to live can help you overcome anything.  We used this book for a small book club and it gave us a lot to talk about.  We are meeting tomorrow to watch the movie together.
 As the horrors of WWII are exposed from different view points, the randomness of life &amp; death are revealed. Suitable for teens to adults, the story seems to question its own plot at times. Just how does one endure? They just do.
 I think I have read most novels written on the Holocaust.  This book, whose narrator is Death, gives a different perspective in that it focuses on an ordinary small German community and the war's effect on ALL of the inhabitants rather than exclusively on the Jewish citizens.
 I read this before seeing the movie because I never like to judge a book by its movie. It was long but Markus zusak's writing is so beautiful that I could wait to hear more of the story. I highly recommend this book to anyone!
 The book was a bit hard at first to get into but as I did I couldn't wait to get back to it when I did have to put it down. You must pay attention as it does jump around a bit. I plan to reread it again soon. I really liked the book and the way my heart would sing or cry for the people in it.
 An extraordinary book I didn't want to end!<br/><br/>Six months ago, I knew nothing about the Book Thief until I stumbled upon the movie on TV. Captivating from the first scene to the last, the tale tells of the plight of Liesel Meminger, a 9-year-old communist child who comes of age in war-stricken Germany during WW II. After falling in love with movie and watching it too many times to count, I couldn't wait to read the book!<br/><br/>Beautifully written by Zusak and narrated by Death himself, this brilliant and unforgettable novel made me laugh and made me cry as we follow Liesel from the loss of her former life to that of her new life on Heaven Street in the fictional town of Molching, Germany, just outside Munich. Unable to read and write when we first meet Liesel, we are invited into her world as she discovers the power of words and the impact that power has in the life surrounding her in Nazi Germany. Through Zusak's poetic prose, the story unfolds and we instantly become a part of life on Heaven Street and empathize with these endearing characters as they revel in their achievements; yet suffer their hardships Nazi oppression, Jewish persecution, the constant threat of air raids and the loss of love ones.<br/><br/>Told in gripping detail and suspense, the book will no doubt have you turning the pages as fast as I did. The Book Thief is one of the most enchanting, yet profoundly moving tales I have read in a long time. While the movie brings to life the book so brilliantly, the latter gives you all the background you need with character insights that are just not possible in the cinematic format.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, both book and movie are a must read, must see.
 This is a fantastic, beautiful, read.  Such a great story and so visual - a new and different holocaust-story that is moving and poignant.  Not a difficult read, either.  Thoroughly enjoyed this.
 Although this book is supposed to be geared to young adults, it works very well for this not so young adult. This story tells a different side of Nazi Germany from people who are poor and do not agree with the government.
 One of the best reads ever. I've seen war as well, as much as was described in this book. The narrator and I have crossed paths, but so far have never met. His quotes however, have been thought about, yet the words have not been heard. The horrors brought on by human values, or rather lack of same, will forever decline the never ending search for peace on earth. God bless us all who continue the search just the same.
 This is a book that I indulged myself into reading nonstoply for a whole week！The words and sentences are exquisite，more importantly，the story is touching and I would like to read a second time！
 I had a tough time, initially, getting into the book. Having Death narrate it was a bit .... odd. But once I got into it, I couldn't stop - wonderful, rich characters and a fantastic storyline. This is a must-read!
 This goes to the top 5 list of my favorite books.  The writing style is unique and engaging, I was completely fascinated with the style, story and integrity of the characters.
 My favorite book. The Author has quite a way with words- found myself constantly amazed at his masterfully written sentences and the unique spin he puts on an era in history that is fairly common.
 War torn Europe during WWII. People everywhere are suffering &amp; trying to just survive.  Well worth the read. I wanted to read the book before I see the movie &amp; I'm glad I did.
 This book was very different.  Not something I would normally read, but I found it hard to put down.  The writer takes a strange approach but makes it work.  I would recommend it.  And now, I'm ready to see the movie!
 Beautifully written story of terribly hard times of war. Extraordinary character development - Liesel is unforgettable. Her love of words reminds us all how precious is the ability to read.
 I did not read the ending where it tells who narrates the book.  Then someone told me and it kind of spoiled it for me.  So much better than the movie (as usually is the case). So people "DON'T TELL"...
 This was hard to put down.  It was well written and drew me in emotionally.
 How can one story be so beautiful and so painful?  The story told here even touches the heart of Death. Brilliantly written, it takes us to an emotional place that we rarely go, and forces us to face that painful reality again. I'm better for having read this, and so grateful to Zusak for its creation.
 My grand daughter had read it as required reading in high school and we discussed it.  I read the book and loved it.  It is written in a such a way that makes you feel like you could understand the main characters.  It was such an awful time in our history and continues to amaze my how so many survived.  I loved how the story was told with the 'soul gatherer'.  Anxious  to see the movie.  Recommend this book.
 Written in an unusual format, enjoyed the illustrations and the concept of stories being written inside stories. the characterisations were well drawn and I liked the concept of learning about ordinary people during the second world war. It was unusual in as much as death was the narrator of the story and was presented as one of the characters. There was a question about the character Leisle as to whether she may have been a Jew and this added to the intrigue. I enjoyed the book immensely and would recommend it to any one from early teenage to adult to read.
 The Book Thief is a winding, gut wrenching story of a girl and her ability to calm the people around her through her ability to steal and read books ,during the Holocaust era. Graphic and gripping. This reader could not put the book down and yet did not want it to end either. Well Told!
 I couldn't put it down. Just the shock of the war and the love of Liesel's family, Rudy, I can't describe in words the affect this book had on me. I loved the narrator and the overall feel of the book. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a bit of action, romance, and the love and connection of neighbors.
 An abosolutely amazing book!  The first few pages were hard to get through because it IS abstract; however, after that I could not put it down.  The story is terrifying, funny and heartwarming all at the same time.  It gives the reader a look into the human soul from a vantage point we rarely see.
 I love this book. Period end of story.  I actually could feel like I knew the characters. I'll probably read it again☺
 Best of the genre. I was captured the moment I realized Death was the narrator. This story is breathtaking and devastating.
 it took me at least a quarter of the book to get into it - death as a narrater was not a slam dunk for me -but it's well worth sticking it out. Really good book.
 This was a book that drew me in and kept me in until the last page. Characters are well fleshed out and you come to know them and care about them deeply. I would highly recommended this book.
 Never had I paid so much attention to the narrator as I have done so with this book. At times I found him frustrating and trying very hard to understand why he gave away so much and if I could even trust the information he was giving. I know I will understand after sometime why he did what he did; but it still kept me wanting to punch him in the nose to the very end. Many of the terms were a bit difficult to understand until I digested a children's copy of Hitlers life and times. Now I'm reading 'Night'.
 Loved it.  I was not sure about it at first and did not want to feel sad as the book was leading to an impending doom. However, the book was beautiful tragedy and a must read. I am so glad I read it and was sad for it to end.
 I bought this book for my twin sister and she says that this book is amazing and that everyone should read it.
 I enjoyed this book very much.  Beautifully written.  Very moving.  The horrors of Nazis Germany were described and I so admired the courage of this young child and her friend.  A bit tragic though but it all works out in the end.
 The Book Thief is an astounding and powerful story, with a surprisingly warm narrator. I had to intentionally slow down my reading to prolong the ending, I did not wish for it to come so soon. Thought provoking and unnerving. I found myself pausing frequently to catch my breath - taking in the fullness of the phrases and lines throughout. Haunting from start to finish. Death himself, the colors, a book thief. So ugly and so glorious . . . so damning and brilliant - the power of words ~ indeed!
 I decided to read the book because the movie looked interesting and I am so glad I did!  This is the saddest but most amazing story I've read, it shows us a life we could barely even imagine in a time where people lived in hell.
 I like stories about people and their lives. This was well written and held my attention. Parts are very sad.
 I was going to go the see the move "The Book Thief" but my friend said the read the book first. Although she cried during the movie she said the book was important to read.<br/>I thoroughly enjoyed it and was hooked from 1st page. It taught me a lot about ww2 and about humility and survival.<br/>I am not sure I will see the movie since this book was very vivid already.
 I have read this novel many times, and it pulls at my heart every time. The unique narrator is enough to keep the reader interested. It is a different view on the going on of WWII Germany that is quite refreshing.
 I've been meaning to read this book and it lived up to its expectations. It's sad and somber and real. I liked how the narrator was Death and how he interacted with the humans during this tragic time (WWII). After so much sadness though, it had a nice warm ending.
 This book brought about a greater understanding of the times. I never could understand why people in that era couldn't  stop the atrocities that were happening around them, but everyone was in danger if you spoke up or tried to help.
 This book had a bit of a slow start but I told myself "if you want to see the movie you have to finish the book" about a quarter of the way in it really started to pick up and I couldn't put it down. Loved the book and the development of characters, hoping the movie does the book justice
 Beautifully written, this is a story that will mesmerize and haunt you with the power of words, colors, and characters with a plot that turns corner after corner, drawing you in.
 This book was wonderfully created, beautifully written and descriptively told. I smelled the air, felt the cold and celebrated the humanness of the story. Instead of being crushed by sadness and loss creativity filled the darkness.
 Learning, enjoying and riveting all at the same time. What more needs to be said.<br/>Detail was huge for me in this book. They seemed to have covered all of it. Loved the book.<br/>Now I can see it at the movies !!!!!!
 The narrator of this audio book was perfect.  The book was so beautifully written that I found myself sitting in my car after I'd reached my destination, just to listen a little longer.  I've since watched the movie, and while good, does not compare to the book.
 This was my first e-book and it was one that I found to be both very absorbing and interesting. What made it even more interesting was it's setting on the outskirts of Munich during WWII, in places that I could relate easily too. Many of the descriptions are particularly vivid, allowing the reader's imagination to paint clear images of the characters as they faced their daily challenges. Some tears were shed. A highly recommended read for anyone interested in stories of the impact that war can have on everyday people.
 I haven't cried so much from a book in many many years. This book was absolutely beautiful. If you can, I suggest listening to it on audible... Only because the narrator was just stunning. Amazing book. Very impressed!
 Having death narrate the book was a new experience and needed some getting used to.  It was very good as well as devastating.  I guess I figured it would be considering the setting and time.
 - Loved the entire book!<br/>- Would recommend to older audience, not recommended for kids under 14 or 13.<br/>- The book was flat out amazing.
 Really liked the story. I liked the unique perspective of the narrator (Death) and the story of courageous Liesel in Nazi Germany. Such a sad, powerful story, and moving story of small opposition in the face of major changes.
 Loved this book. Sad, charming, endearing. An exceptional read about an extraordinary child and kind souls during a very bad time. Read it before you see the movie (of course!)
 The Book Thief is an amazing story of a boy and girl in World War II.  The setting doesn't stray much from their Berlin neighborhood.  All through the book, the reader doesn't expect a happy ending, and doesn't  really get one, except for a bright spot that makes one long for a sequel.  The reader will be appalled by some of the events in the book, and warmed by others and will remember this haunting story for a long time.
 not what i expected but very good.  another reminder of a sad time in our history. we do need these reminders and we do need to take more action so we stop all of this racial hatred.
 Good writing with a different perspective on the narrative.  Thought provoking as to what choice did some Germans have during WWII to not support Hilter.
 I must admit, the beginning had me a little confused with a different writing style &amp; a perspective I wasn't expecting. But as I read on, it really was a great read. The point of view was an important factor in this story &amp; it made the book all the more interesting. Markus Zusak tells us a story of nazi Germany in a different light &amp; I am really glad I read it.
 I started reading the book and had no high expectations of it.There is always high hope that it will be a book that will keep me captivated. That i will get so involved with the characters and that although I want to continue to read to find out how the story evolves and ends, I get sad when its all done. The Book Thief did just that. As tears run down my cheeks I write my personal review in hopes that you will also feel the way I do about the book
 This book tells a very interested side of Nazi Germany. Death narrates a little girls life as a book thief and the challenges she faces as well as the people she meets along the way. I would definitely recommend reading this book!
 What lessons we have to learn.  This is a difficult book to read, starting with the narration from Death.  But so important to remember the lessons of war and humanity.  The movie follows the book closely and is equally a necessary see.
 I almost didn't read this book. Several friends had read it and said that it was amazing but when the movie came out.... I figured it wasn't for me. oh how I was wrong. The Book Thief is beautiful. It has taught me so much and I loved every minute of it. I would recommend it to anyone who's asks... even if I did cry the last few chapters
 The way in which this book is written is was kept me intrigued.  I loved that it was told from a different perspective.  It was light hearted in some respects but heartbreaking in others.  Keep the tissues handy for this one.
 Amazing book!!!
 Purchasing the book was fast and simple. I received the book very quickly and even though it was used, it's in great condition. The book itself surprised me! I had no idea who the narrator was at first and was totally shocked when I realized! I am still reading it and it is so interesting I know I will finish it long before I need to report on it for my book club. It was an excellent buy!
 I loved the writing style of the author, very funny and relatable even though the story isn't funny.  It seemed to drag on towards the end but all and all a great story.  I can't say the same for the movie.
 I really enjoyed this book. Originally I was afraid it would be depressing, but it was not. It was a different take on Nazi Germany before and during WWII. I was at first taken aback by who the narrator was, but then came to appreciate the creativity. Very interesting story.
 I am so glad I read this book before watching the film. It was beautifully written and although the subject matter is disturbing to say the least, it was handled by Markus in the best possible way. Thought provoking and exciting. I found it hard to put it down. Books like this help us never to forget the horror of the holocast but written in an entertaining way.
 Great read. Kind of sad. Interesting angle as it is narrated by "death". would recommend to all ages. Human interest stories, particularly those with a real historical context always the best!
 Very good book. I would have given it 5 stars but the way it was written is a little... Weird! Told from 'Death's' point of view, I found the flow a little choppy, instead of the desired effect. The story itself though, is fantastic!
 One of the most beautiful novels on the devastating effects of Naziism on Germany
 Great book!
 Great story! I was glad that I saw the movie first, though,  because it was difficult to get into the rhythm of the author's writing style until I had read 40 or more pages. But, by having seen the film, I could connect the dots.
 Very sad, but the way it was written was very interesting. I'm not sure I think it was as great as I'd been told, but it was good, and it did evoke emotions. I would definitely recommend it to people who are interesting in WWII.
 Helped my son with his comprehensive final essay comparing The Bean Trees to The Iliad and The Book Thief.
 This book provided a very different view of WWII - Germany. It was so interesting, funny and sad. It helped you to view residents who were against Hitler, yet had to put up a brave front. I enjoyed the read.
 This is another book that I think is a must read. It is told through a child's eyes and its very eye opening .  This is a very vivid read and well worth every minute I spent reading it.
 A book that was well written, and a real page-turner, but I always felt quite sad about the events, and went to sleep with a heavy heart.  So definitely not a "feel good" read, but well worth it.<br/><br/>It was interesting to get a 'German' perspective during those turbulent times, as quite obviously, not all Germans agreed or supported Hitler or the treatment of the Jewish community!<br/><br/>I do not think I will go to see the Movie though, as I cannot see how it could do the book justice.
 It's not often that a book about Nazi Germany can be described as beautiful but this book is very beautiful. It hurts to read sometimes but it never left me feeling desolate &amp; hopeless. It took a bit to fall into the rhythm of the words but after awhile it seemed natural.
 It took me 2 weeks to read this book.  That was frustrating for me.  But the story held my attention and I kept wanting to go back until I finished it.  I am a bit of a history buff and this book being written by " death"gave it an unique perspective.  If you've got a lot of time it's a great book.  550 pages is a bit much though.
 Good<br/>Unusual prose, wrenching metaphors- a story of a war and time that should never be forgotten.  A magnificent tale
 This story is narrated by Death.  A young German girl, Liesel  learns to read, comes to love books, and steals.  Sharing these stolen books brings some relief to those around her.  " The Book Thief "  personalizes the horrors of World War II .  This book is a must read as it reminds us that war does not happen to countries - it happens to people.
 I couldn't put this book down, and I have read it again and again! I think I probably loved books just as much as this little girl but she had more to deal with in Nazi Germany. It was an exciting book and I enjoyed each page.
 an engaging read, well written with character depth, the subject is not my usual, but this is a book made it memorable. I am looking forward to reading more by this author.
 Great product
 Amazing book. I highly recommend it. Very imaginative and the narration puts you right in the middle of the scenes.
 The author can turn a phrase. His story telling and wit throughout the book made for a compelling and emotional page turner that I enjoyed right up to the ending.  The ending left me wanting; I would not say more but wanting something. I was so engrossed in the book I was shocked it was over.  It felt like a great romance that turned into a one night stand.<br/><br/>I do not want to give away the ending nor do I want to pull this book down as I did enjoy the time I spent with "The Book Thief" and look forward to more stories from this surprising writer.
 Great book.... be patiend if the first few pages seem confusing, it takes a few pages (not a lot) to figure out who narrator is. From there is it is a very good book, so much better than the movie.
 Many books have been written about the holocaust but this one brings home with such clarity how cruel and how compassionate humans are capable of being. I personally have never read a book quite like The Book Thief. I have recommended it to our book club.
 I loved this book! When the movie came out I decided to read the book before watching the movie. I'm glad I did!. I first got the book from my local library. Long story short I couldn't finish the book. But I wanted to finish the book soooo bad that  I ordered for my kindle.<br/>Now I have it for my daughters to read. The story just grabs you and makes you not want to put it down. I mean like reading late into the night kind of book. Great book. I recommend it to anyone that likes a story based on history.
 A fantastic book,very well written, a true 3 dimensional book, gives the reader superb opportunity to create vivid images as they are reading.
 Another sad story of the terrible things that take place during war.  Written very well, a tear jerker at times - but im not going to give away the story.  The book is better than the movie...
 I enjoyed every moment of this book.<br/>A stolen book or two makes a lovely hook to a time and place of such horrors. The characters were very well written and the whole book was very believable. This one is worth buying and reading.
 A gripping story that is poetically written. The subject matter is rarely mentioned; the story of the struggle to exist that faced many Germans during the time of Hitler.
 I was a bit thrown off by the style at first, but after getting through the first chapter, I couldn't put it down. Great story. At the end I wished I knew more about the characters and what happened.
 The Book Thief is, on the surface, a fairly simple tale of a girl fostered by a washerwoman and her housepainter husband in Germany during the second world war. It is told is some of the most haunting prose I've ever read. The characters and scenes are rendered so beautifully, they linger long after the book is put away.<br/><br/>Markus Zusak seems an amazingly young man to write with such lyrical beauty and poignant insight. I can't recommend this book highly enough.
 I had a bit of trouble with the choppiness of the format....but the subject was riveting and the word choices were very well done.  Highly recommend watching the movie after reading the book.
 Awesome book! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
 I decided to read this book when I saw trailers fir it .  I couldn't put it down. Told from the perspective of Father Death, the grim reaper, a story of many souls is retold replayed as he unveils Nazi Germany.  War is an ugly truth, but the words are vivid and alive.
 Wonderful book. A new take on a well traversed subject - but the Book Thief takes an unusual perspective that keeps the pages turning. The characters are believable and the depth of humanity does much to mitigate the cruelty of the war. Those who enjoy reading will understand the passion and the desire which is the centre-piece of this very human and enthralling book.
 Excellent and very unusual!  Recommended by my 21 year old granddaughter as one of her favorites. I have given it to my 13 year old granddaughter who had heard of it and wanted to read it.  great for all ages!
 Compelling story.
 the book thief is a story that took me many nights to finish. I have cried, and laughed, but mostly cried, over the words of death and liesel. take the time to read this book. take the time to think and be grateful for life.
 Many books have been written about the plight of Jews in World War II. The Book Thief tells a story set in World War II from a different perspective, from that of a German child. The narrator is also a unique character with a different, allbeit prolific persona. It is refreshing to read about a few good Germans when so many were lumped into a group of those who are hated for wanting to annihilate Jews. Rich characters whom you will care about, a well written story, and unique perspective make this a memorable book. I loved it!
 This book is truly great.  After seeing the movie some time ago, I really did not know what to expect.  Everyone who saw the movie, should read the book, the movie does follow the book well, but the book brings the movie to life.  I saw the movie first, then read the book, my husband read the book, then saw the movie, neither of was disappointed in either.  A wonderful book, written well and gives more incite into rural Germany during the Hitler era.
 ... but it was so beautiful I can easily forgive the author. Very, very well written - the clearly described events, people, places, times, and enemies helped bring everyone to life in a heart-piercing way.
 I do not know if this was really a realistic depiction of the life and people in "small town Germany" during Hitler's reign but it rang true.  It was, in turn, both sad and uplifting.  I highly recommend it.
 This is a story wrapped in sadness, humor, fantasy and cruel realism, and a profoundness that moves and says a lot about human nature. It's written with subtle poignancy, with clarity and a masterful command of the written word that makes reading it a bittersweet delight. Although unique in his literary talent, Markus Zusak reminds me a little of Heinrich Boll ("Billiards at Half Past Nine", "The Clown"), and seems by no measure less gifted. If you will only read one book this year, make it "The Book Thief" - it's unforgettable...
 This is a wonderful book, engrossing, well-developed characters.  It brings the feel of every day life to a terrible time in history.  I highly recommend it.
 It's difficult to think about much less DO.  After Zusak's masterpiece the notion of reading some other novel, maybe a mystery series or one of many current "best sellers", it's all just mediocre fiction.  The Book Thief cannot be touched by anything else in contemporary writing.  Truly a classic for all time.
 One of my favourite reads ever, even though the initial pages were confusing, as the book thief's watcher introduces himself.  Don't give up though, or you will miss a tragic yet compelling story, set during the horror years of the second world war.  One small girl, taken into a dreadfully poor family brings hope, friendship and humanity into a community bereft and living in constant fear.<br/>Marcus Zusak's writing is superb.  Highly recommended.
 Sad and original, the depiction of the places and the love for books are mingled with a very human tale about a girl from a credible and innocent perspective
 This book was EXCELLENT - the writing absolutely pulls you into the characters and the times; sos much so I had a hard time putting it down. I haven't seen the movie - I think I will wait because the book was so good.
 Easily digested. I loved the way death narates the story--this is an unusual twist.<br/>Iloved the way it talks about a German girl as being a victim of the war, often not something considered in other books.<br/>Very memorable and thought provoking. I longed to pick it up again and again.
 It was one of the strangest books I have read. It was extremely hard to read st first. It wad a book I could put down for days and not think.about. but then it had that way of slowly grabbing you until you were hooked
 A very interesting style of writing and word pictures telling such a tragic yet human story of love, hate, redemption, and a souls rest after overcoming fear and experiencing love everlasting. You'll have to figure out the person telling the story on your own; I wouldn't want to ruin the surprise
 Such a good story!  And it shows the hardships encountered by the common German citizen during World War II, a point of view we Americans don't see often.
 From the opening paragraphs, I just loved this book.  The descriptive prose is just beautiful, the narration (I thought of this character as the Angel of Death) was captivating, and the story so thought provoking as it presents a different angle on the lives of many good german people during the Hitler years.  I also found myself not relegating this story to history, but wondering about comparisons with current political situations and displaced people.  A great book for me is one that stays with me after I finish it, and this one certainly did.
 Such a unique perspective.  This book is written from "Death's"  point of view.  The story is heartbreaking but it is also very captivating.  Wonderful characters that I will miss now that I'm finished reading this book!
 The enhanced edition is great! Definately recommend to lovers of The Book Thief. Very beautiful addition to my digital shelf, and couldn't be happier!
 Super fast shipping! Excited to give this book to my son for his birthday.
 Long before its ending you know the direction the story is headed, and yet you will be driven to finish. This story will fill you with many emotions before you are through.
 Awesome one of my favorites
 a refreshing, sweetly soulful story of a wretched time in human history,as told with softly understated dignity and respect, by Death.<br/>Zusak's literary style sets him apart from most popular writers. His style flows with our stream of conscious thought patterns. Very readable.
 Still thinkof this book years after I read it.  Is often classified as a young adult novel, but is too complex for younger readers to grasp the gravity of the story.
 One of the best books I've ever read.  This author takes a story that isn't unique and turns it into a compelling read by choosing a completely unique narrator.  The descriptions are vivid but many authors can describe beautifully.  What sets this author apart is his ablity to make you feel what the character is feeling.  And not just the main character, but the ancillary players as well.  Read this book!  Wonderful!
 Loved it. Loved it. A very young girl who bounced around after her mother couldn't care for her anymore. So she gave her to a family in Germany. Life take a different turn for the good and the bad. However, she keeps herself sane and entertained despite the Nazis. Constantly reading everyghing that she could borrow or steal.  She finds her independence.
 This  novel depicts world war 2 from the standpoint of one community.  We see war not as just battles,  But we see the war through the eyes and interaction of  the people. The author also lends some authenticity by bringing in some German words and flashbacks.  I know at the beginning I found it hard to understand the plot . but as you progress into the novel you g things seem to fall in place,  One thing that caught my interest was the Title of the book.  Your curious because who would want to steal the books and what did they use it for.
 This was an interesting book and very sad.  I had never thought, or read, about how the poorer German people suffered during the war. They were the innocent victims of the Hitler era. Quite an eye opener. Good reading and something different for a change.
 If ever there was a perfectly written novel, I feel that this is it.  I was surprised at how I quickly became attached to the characters and flawless story.  This should be required reading for everyone.
 I cant tell you what the book is about or if it is a good read... bought for my daughters required reading.  But I can tell you that the book was in 100% perfect condition, great price, quick shipping.  Amazon is my go to place for books.
 I found the literary style of this book to be immediately engaging. There are moments in this book where I feel as if I am hearing from one who was there during that horrific time. Well done.
 This a deeply moving book.  The writing is beautiful and hooked me before I realized what the story was about.  It is described as young adult or juvenile fiction, I am 70 years old and found it heart wrenching beautiful.  Read it.
 Fascinating writing style. Powerful, moving, thought provoking, believable story. Complex, well developed characters and plot. Hauntingly tender and beautiful. Loved it!
 The Book Thief was written from a variety of perspectives:  the characters and of death.  I loved the insertions of "clarifications" and wisdom that were so cleverly placed in the chapters.  The descriptions of the settings, people and the plight of Germany were able to take me back in time and truly experience this dark era.  The story reveals the power of love and the love of books!
 This book grabbed me as no book has in a long time.  The story is full of beauty, struggle and sadness.  The descriptions are beyond amazing.  Reading kept me from sleeping. The characters are so real. I laughed with them and  wept with them .  I have never before been so moved to review a book.  J. Bradbury
 Well written, well define character , a sweet book that I would recommend to my children and grandchildren.  Today, there is not a lot of respect for the written word unless it is on an electronic device.  It would be great if future generations would know how we could love books!
 We read this book in our monthly book club.  It offered a different perspective of WWII from the German citizen point of view.  Enlightening.
 DEATH is the narrator of this book, and he takes you through the horrors and sorrows of World War II. There are good times, too, and he finds them in the life of this little girl, the BOOK THIEF, so much so that he can't turn loose of her life even when he steals the life of her little brother. You'll be captivated.
 Good book!  Interesting take on 1st person being "Death" who is telling the story.  The story takes place during the start of WW II and is from the side of Germans who are semi-forced into Nazism and the Youth Armies.
 This is a difficult book to read but stick with it.  It gives the reader a peek into what life was like in Germany during WWII.  It is sad, but well worth the read.
 So much has been written about the obvious victims of the war without considering the effects on the other victims simply drawn into the war against their wishes. Those German citizens who were powerless to fight the system suffered enormously and to some extent this book tries to put that time period into perspective.<br/>An unusual style of writing but a compelling read.
 The best book I have ever read and will continue to read to get through it.  The characters protrayed a very sad situation as the Nazi's came to power and putting even their own people through hell as the war progressed.
 Highly recommended!
 I was thoroughly engrossed from beginning to end of this read. Understanding how the other half lived and survived is inspiring, knowing that Hitler's influence was not successful in turning all Germans away from their humanitarian side. There are many heroes in this story. I would suggest this book be read at all age levels.
 I cried tears of spiraling empathy circling between sadness and admiration. These characters lived and breathed for me. Read this book with tissues close by. Bravo!
 A very unusual book but a great read.  I ordered the Enhanced Movie Tie-in Edition; however, my Nexus was not equipped to handle it.  Disappointing but it was my fault now knowing what my Nexus could accommodate.
 Hard to put down book that focuses on the friendship that develops between a youn girl and the Jewish man her parents are hiding in their basement during WWII.  I loved this book!  Didn't want to put it down!
 Beautifully written and such a unique narration. It's been a while since a book has brought me to tears (more like a blubbering mess). So worth the read!
 The reader is captivated by the story of a little girl who is obsessed with learning to read even though many books are burned and discarded when the Nazi's controlled Germany.  You have to love her spunk.
 Well written. Could not put it down. Looking forward to seeing the movie now. Gives you the perspective of WWII from the eyes of the German people, both Nazis &amp; normal people having to live under the terror of Hitler
 This novel is beautiful.  I may have to share it with students next year.  It would make a good companion piece to "The Diary of Anne Frank" or "Night."
 not my fave. I usually love historical fiction...
 This is one of the best books I have ever read. The format is unique and plays well to showcase the humanity that struggles to survive in Hitler's inhumane world. I am sad to have this story end.
 A stunning story that shows how simple people, simple things create a tapestry of beauty. Love, friendship and survival are demonstrated against the backdrop of an evil time....and the power of words is shown for both good an evil.
 Really enjoyed the read.  Decided to read it prior to going to see the movie.  Glad that I did.  Movie was okay but they changed a few things that did not have the impact that it did in the book.  Totally recommend reading it.
 This book was incredibly moving. I laughed and cried repeatedly.  The relationships between Liesel and her father, mother, Rudy, Max, and Ilsa were fantastically written. Truly one of the most beautiful books I've read in quite some time!
 This book is odd and written in a different style than any other book I've ever read (which is probably the author's intent). It is captivating and sheds light on life from a very different vantage point. Clever story with impact.
 This book captivated me and kept me turning the pages, but bits of it were strange. The narrator is a bit unconventional and at times offensive, but his story is well worth the read.<br/><br/>I would recommend this story to any who love a good historical fiction.<br/><br/>I didn't give it a five because I put it down twice after the first chapter because it was "weird." But something kept drawing me back. Once I got past the intro, I was hooked.<br/><br/>Give it a try...you won't be sorry!
 I bought this book because our son had to read it for Honors English.  My wife and I both read it and I found it to be one of the best books I've ever read.  This book was added, nearly immediately, into my "must keep"  collection.<br/>  The book is written unlike any other book, in as much as death is the narrator, and the little snippets of information all throughout the book showcases a writing style that is believable, highly readable and a very interesting (as far a I know) creation by Zusak.<br/>  My wife and I are very interested in Germany during WWII anyway, and this being a novel set during that time, but telling the story of an unpersecuted little girl made it very interesting.<br/>  I look forward to reading Zusak's other books, but I don't know that they could ever match this masterpiece.<br/>  I guarantee you will laugh a little while reading it and I guarantee you'll cry.  Excellent.
 Book arrived on time and in excellent condition.  The narrator details her experiences as a transported non-Jewish child placed in the protective custody during WWII.  Far from being a story of Nazi atrocities, the book concentrates on the relationships formed between a loving "adopted" family and meaningful friendships with the hidden bonus of unlikely, but devoted friends and their mischievious youthful adventures. After the first few pages, the story grips your heart with details about a survivor in hidden by apolitcal French and ethical people putting themselves in danger to save an innocent child. A great book for book clubs of all interets.
 Everybody by now has read or heard of this book. It was slow to start, but a great story.
 Great book, overall.
 A wonderfully told and written story.  I truly enjoyed it.
 What can I say about this beautifully-written, transcendent novel that hasn't already been said?  Except that I read it aloud to my special needs daughter and she was transfixed by it.  It was quite difficult reading it toward the end because I was crying.  If there is an audio version, I certainly do commend the actor who read it because I couldn't get through the last part without weeping.  This is the sort of book that changes lives.  It deserves all the accolades it has received.<br/><br/>A beautiful novel!
 I loved the movie, but this book is even better.  Mr. Zusak has a wonderful way with imagery, and it makes this book a true pleasure to read.  His words are beautifully chosen.
 I had seen the movie prior to reading the book which helped as very descriptive - but a truly wonderful story - Makes us aware of how blessed we are to have our freedom
 This was an amazing story!  I enjoyed every moment of it.  So believable and touching!  Read it in a very short time, when in fact, I should have been busy with other duties.  Love, love, love it!!!
 I found the use of the narrator cumberson. Other than that the book was well written and quite touching.  It was a totally different view of the Nazi period through the eyes of a child..  Well worth the read!  I am looking forward to seeing the movie as I would think filming this story would be quite a feat.
 I found this book fascinating. The writing style is so different from what I usually read. Not an uplifting story, but I had a hard time putting it down. Made me thankful for living in the present in spite of the problems we have today. May we remember the past and never do that again.
 The best account of a child growing up during the Second World War. It captures the mentality of the country, written set in the labor class milieu
 The story of the young girl and the history happening around her was an interesting read.  I would like to see the movie to see how the story was told.  The book was very good.
 I couldn't put this book down. Zusak is not only a word collector, he is an artist who uses words instead of clay. This is a monumental work that I will read and retread many times
 I loved this book. It was slow starting but once into it you couldn't put it down. Toward the end I cried but at the very end I was glad how it ended. I have and would recommend this book to others.
 This was a hard book to read and follow most of the time.  The time in Germany was a bad time for Germans and Jews alike.  Death was a constant and the reminder of what happened to Jews was horrific. Took me some time to finish this one and I truly had a tough time with this one book.
 The words grabbed me from the start.  The young girl filled the pages with joy and anger, with pride and deep seated sorrow.  Man's inhumanity to man burned the pages but the words survived.  I can only say be prepared to fall in love with the story and the characters.  I wept when the story ended.
 Because it broke my heart for humanity and soothed it at the same time.
 the hype was overrated, i think.  sad story, but boring at times.  okay for historical fiction.  i would think the book is worth it for the historical aspect of it.
 I first experienced this book as a recording. It was shattering and wondrous. I bought copies to give to my friends. Now I just bought a copy for myself (again). Very powerful. Seldom have I read the WWII story told from the point of view of ordinary Germans. This is a universal story.
 This book started off a little weird for me.  Glad I hung with, as it got better with each turn of the page.  Sad, sweet, agonizing, lovely...many words could be used to describe The Book Thief.  I thought it was great.
 The characters come alive. The story sucks you in and carries you along. A relevant book at any time but maybe especially now during these times of human conflict in Gaza and in the Ukraine...sadly, there are so many more to name. The Book Thief reminds us of the innocents whose lives are forever changed during a struggle for power. I literally sobbed through reading the last 15-minutes of the the book. Insert incredibly sad-faced emoticon here! I recommend the book for anyone, but especially young readers who represent our future.
 A different side of Germany and an eye-opening view into the poverty, strength, heart, and terror of people trying to do the right thing while being lead by a maniac.
 After seeing the movie; I realized there was much more to this story, and there was.  The story is told from a unique storytellers point of view.  WWII was horror, but this story also has joy and compassion.
 A very different perspective look through the eyes of children. Heartbreaking at times but it showed the amazing love between a Jewish man and a German girl. A must read.
 The Book Thief was  an unexpected treasure. It was gentle and brutal at the same time. An truly excellent read.
 This is a very good book to read. Loved it
 Didn't everyone love this book?  No, my sister didn't but I don't think she gave it a chance.  It is super over the top...one of my favorites and I read a lot.
 This is one of the best books I've read in years.  The character development and story are captivating and I didn't want to put it down.  I highly recommend this one.
 He weaves a story in a very descriptive manner.  The horrors of WW II are so vividly portrayed, I felt I was experiencing some of the events. I love portraying it thru the voice of the "Grimm reaper". I shall certainly read his other books now. Great read!!!
 Teen appropriate style. Brief statements with carefully selected language, for visual effects.<br/>Sensitive adolescent emotional descriptors. Creates awareness of Nazism's influence on daily life for German citizens.
 My only disappointment is not knowing what became of she and Max!  I really wanted to know what became of them until her death!
 Markus Zusak chose an interesting slant to tell his story from the view point of death.  People born after WWII have no conception of the vicious, evil purpose of Hitler's war on the world.  An informative read for everyone.
 After seeing the movie I felt that there was more to this story and I bought this book the next day.  Extremely well written.  The main story lines are  powerful and gripping.  There are several nooks and crannies not in the film that are worth exploring in the book.  It even turns out that Liesel is not the only "book thief."
 Loved this book. As I got closer to the end, I read little bits and much slower---I just didn't want it to end! Sweet story set in Nazi Germany before &amp; during WWII.
 interesting take one the fates of the characters and shaping of young lives with a bit of attention and understanding. The importance of having something of ones own takes on special meaning.
 A rather dark theme. I realize that the story took place in wartime Germany. The "Reaper" approach was rather unique. Started a little slow but gained momentum as the story progressed. Enjoyed very much.
 This book was bought for my daughter for her summer reading for school. She is surprisingly enjoying it. We both thought that because it was an assigned reading that she would not enjoy it.  She has told me that she really enjoys the book and is looking forward to finishing it so that she can watch the movie. :)
 good read
 It took me awhile to get into this book. At first I considered it almost childish, but then I realized that was the author's intent. We are meant to grow with this book as Liesel grows. The choice of death as a narrator is beautiful and incredibly appropriate, as who else could explain the pangs of being human better?
 School textbook
 The Book Thief is a great read.  It is unique and very well written.  Parts of the book reminded me of a couple of people I knew who had lived as children in Munich during the period.  Thoughtful and holds onto the reader. Highly recommend.
 Awesoke
 This is  the perfect book to curl up with a blanket on a cold winter day.<br/>The narrator is surprisingly kind, and the reader becomes emotionally attached to all of the characters.<br/>It was a great story and I was sad when it ended.
 OK
 This book was very different but very interesting. It is well worth the read.
 Some books you like right away, some take time to grow on you, others-- well, you'd like to like them, but you don't, and you don't ever.<br/><br/>This book is written in an omniscient narrative (Seems to be from the perspective of the Angel Of Death.) The writing style itself is unusual. Occasionally descriptions about characters, a poetic phrase, or definitions regarding behavior, and/or foreshadowing a character's future are bold faced, indented or open a new chapter--I kept looking for a pattern as to why, but there didn't seem to be any. There is heavy use of metaphor, color, odd use of language in a way that I found distractive and unnecessary, kind of like pseudo-poetry.<br/><br/>This book has an unevenness about it, the flow is off, the writing style seems forced with obvious attempts to be avant-garde.  I always felt as though I were hovering around the characters, never really quite knowing them (and perhaps this is the point) --But if you want the reader to be engaged, well then you have to give them some "meat" to sink their teeth into.<br/><br/> I didn't realize that this book was for young adults, maybe it will appeal to a younger mind, but to my mind- It irritated me unnecessarily by improper use of language...and I know that sounds petty, but when you read a sentence and your thought is "That is just not grammatically correct" --Then it is not touching you, at least not in a nice way.
 This book provided a different perspective on the era of Hitler that was entertaining yet informative.  These characters were genuine in their resourcefulness.
 This was a fascinating, chilling look at the life of those who were trapped in the frightening world of the Second World War.  The Book Thief was a well-written, captivating narrative of another difficult time in our world's history.
 The perspective from which this book is written is haunting.  I loved the story about this young girl who endured so much. Reading about Nazi Germany is never easy but always necessary.  Highly recommend....definitely deserves five stars.
 My mom likes the book, but boy did it come in bad shape!! it was so worn out! Look like at least 10 people had read it before it made its way to my mom!!
 Subject matter is difficult, of course, but through the eyes, heart, and mind of a an adolescent girl, this book is beautifully and hauntingly written. It is crucial that we truly know this truth of our humanity and history.
 Good condition as stated. Pages on edge had an aged yellowing. Would purchase again.
 I love books that not only have a good storyline and interesting characters, but also have the historical background like this novel.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in this time and place in history!
 An interesting slant from the other side of World War Two.  I felt I knew the characters involved and so wanted a typical happy ending.  Well written and thought provoking.
 When death is the narrator it probably should have been a bit of a clue that it would not be a book full of happy endings. It took a couple of goes to get into this book but it was well worth the effort and even the embarassment of being in tears on the bus as I finished.
 We only get one first impression..that being said I give this book four stars because I was lucky enough to pull out the draw that led me further page after page until I was committed to completing the,journey-I almost stopped reading and Saud I`'ll wait f I r t he movie the Angel of death walks around war torn Germany you discover that it is the stories not just of heroes and great events but the instances of small acts of kindness that are the greatest of story-makers...great read
 I enjoyed reading this. It was a little slow at times but still managed to keep my attention. The perspective of the story is different than a lot of the books I have read from this time frame.
 Did not like it at first, but  plowed on and was rewarded with an outstanding read. A sad, but true, not a gruesome  picture of the Holycost..Only saying this because sometimes readers shy away from this. It's a great story and you'll love the ending.
 Such a wonderful book and movie! It took me a bit to get into the book, and to understand who's perspective it is written in, but once I did, I really enjoyed it! The movie is wonderful as well!
 At first I wasn't too interested in the book, but as it went on I was enthralled. I love to read and I honestly cannot think of a book where it was not narrated by the main character; the point of view is so unique.  This book is also a nice narrative of a very historical time. I am not good with reading books that revolve around a historical event, but the author did a wonderful job turning events in to a fictional read. This book is simply wonderful. I definitely will be reading it again.
 What a page turner!
 It was a good book and a lot of historical information that brought that time period to life.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but I'm sure the book, as always, is better.  Great job Markus Zusak!
 It was a little slow starting. I stopped, then started again in the middle. I decided I really did like it, so I read it again, from the beginning. It's been on my mind ever since.
 We as humans make the same mistakes over again and find excuses as to why it's not the same. You read this and you wonder how people could be so deceived and how they could be so uncaring to others and think so highly of themselves.  If enough people read this maybe they will remember it in their dealings with others.<br/><br/>It deserves 5 stars for the way it is written and the emotions it brings out
 A tremendously well written story. This is not a book to rush through to get the "what happened" part of the story.  The plot is predictable.  The enjoyment is the authors almost poetic description of events and surrounding color of the story. The interplay between the story's narrator (the angel of death) and the development the plot was wonderfully conceived.
 The relationships the book thief has with so many different characters keeps you glued to her life. I am curious to see the movie. I just hope it doesn't ruin the images I already have from reading the book.
 A book of humanity and innocence in a time of inhumanity collective complicity. Hope amidst despair. Evil does not always prevail. All the more telling in our world of today. A great read.
 This is a beautifully written book. A must read for anyone who loves books or just loves a good story.
 I posted no violence and no sexual context because the narrator's tone and p of v makes it all very neutral.<br/>I wonderful book that gently presses against your heart.
 It was a very interesting way to tell the story of the book thief, through the "eyes" or perspective of Death.
 The book is written from the perspective of a child, which gives readers a different angle.  Through her experiences, the reader gets a glimpse of how the views and ideas of nazi Germany were formed, and how it impacted the average lower class citizens.  I was inspired by the authors, metaphors and use of verbs.  This is my first ‘electronic’ book purchase, and I am loving it!
 Started out a bit slowly, but picked up and proved to be an interesting, provocative, personal perspective of the German citizen point of view of WWII experiences.
 What can you say about a book that makes the Grim Reaper seem like such a friend? Markus Zusak gives life to Death and many valiant characters who choose to do good in horrific times.
 It was well written and it kept my interest throughout.
 I think this is described as a "young adult" book, but the story is interesting and appropriate for adults as well. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes well-written historical fiction.
 This book was not a "page turner". At times, I couldn't figure out who was talking and who was telling the story. It's a different view of Europe during the war.  The writing was very descriptive.
 The approach taken by the author is very unique in that the story is told from an unlikely character.  This is a book to remember and provides a look into the other side of Nazi Germany, as seen by the children who were in fact Germans.  What I like best about this book is that it does not judge but simply describes the characters and allows the reader to see them as humans.  I loved this book and consider it a must read, it is touching, infuriating and above all real.
 From the very beginning Lisel had to deal with some very tough stuff with the death of her younger brother to becoming a foster child. Never seeing her mother again I couldn't help but want to reach through the book and tell her that it was okay and things would get better. Although I have to say the little side notes that were implemented throughout the book was quite annoying and I never really found myself too fond of them.
 Beautifully-written with a poetic flavor I found brilliant, giving this all-too-realistic story a huge heart. The perspective of the narrator is key and offers an insight we rarely see...
 The best book 📚 ever. Thank you for the great service.
 This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is beautifully written and makes the tragedy of WWII very personal.  I believe this book should be required reading for high school students, for its history and the very beautiful way it is written.
 Since this book is now a movie, I decided to read it instead of watching.  It is truly a beautifully written with an unusual twist for the narrator.  It grabs all your emotions from start to finish without letting you down.  A must read!
 Without a doubt one of the best and most heart wrenching and fulfilling and beautiful and disgusting stories I have ever read.<br/><br/>John
 This book is deeply experienced as well as merely read from beginning to end. Perhaps it is re-read, though it is unlikely to be forgotten.
 I bought this because I had heard it was good. And it was great!<br/><br/>(SPOILERS)<br/><br/>I thought the ending was kind of depressing, but fairly realistic. I like a realistic ending, so I won't deduct a star or anything.
 It took me some time to get into the flow of the narrative.  Almost wanted to put it down.  Once the lightbulb in my mind lit up the pages, I could not stop reading. Amazingly touching.
 This book had a feeling of great sadness about it especially as it was around the hard times of World World 2 but also of great joy as a young girl found such pleasure in the world of words. There is so much pleasure in reading and once I actually started to read The Book Thief the more I wanted to continue. A thoroughly enjoyable read (with tears in my eyes at times) more for the female reader I think. For those that enjoyed this book the movie is also worth a watch.
 Good read.
 It was an inspiring book.  In spite of the risks, this family was willing to hide a man to pay what he felt was a debt to the man's family.  One of those that you can't stop reading.  Looking forward to the movie.
 GREAT BOOK, VERY INTERESTING WANTS YOU TO KEEP READING TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
 This book is a must read!  I am the type of reader that starts and stops a number of books at once.  Some books I have trouble remember the story line when I pick it up again.  NOT THIS ONE!
 Slow start but after that I could not put the book down.  I was surprised a t I was at the end.  A great book would recommend to everyone who wants to learn more about WW 2 Germany.
 One of the ten best books I have ever read. Exquisite writing. Great story. One of those books that is better the second time through.
 A very interesting and different book. If you are looking for a story with a different perspective. Try this one
 Fabulous book written in prose and narrative style.  The author's choice of vocabulary and descriptions are just delicious.  It was a pleasure to read such a book written with such care invoking a myriad of feelings  First rate!!!
 I found this story to be amazing. it was amazing because it told a story of a girl during WW2. This story was so fun to read and adventurous. I loved the fact that it had the idea of a girl who can take people's souls. I also liked the fact that the girl who takes people's souls was telling the story. This is an amazing book and I would recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure and who loves to read
 It is clear the author is writing as a detached observer with little first hand experience from which  to draw.  It is a work, however, that would appeal to adolescents and I recommend it be required reading for intermediate and lower level high school students.  Empathy is scarce perhaps because the author chose Death to be the narrator.  For contrast see Anne Frank, Diary of a Young Girl or, To Kill a Mockingbird.
 This book will hold your mind when you put it down until the time you pick it up again. It speaks to your soul of the injustice of the Hitler regime not only to the Jews but to the Germans who knew their country was overtaken by the devil himself.
 A simple story, Germany, a small town, world war two, a young girl with a love a words, a father with a love of music and a Jew with a love of life.  Do yourself a favor and read this.  I read it slowly because I did not want it to end.  I smiled while reading it, I cried while reading it.  I am now reading a book by the same author, I hope it measures up.
 This book is one you will remember for a long time,with a story you will want to share in discussion with others. Highly  recommended for book clubs and your permanent library. I could not put it down.
 What a wonderful book!!!! I truly enjoyed reading it.  I like a book that tells it like it was.  War is a terrible thing to live through but sometimes good things can come from it.  Very moving and different.
 I was an English Lit major 40 years ago , and I loved the precision in the choice of each word, each phrase, each sentence.  It is a superbly crafted book with an original story line. All 5 stars deserved.
 This book is narrated by Death.  What an excellent view point to tell a story.  I could feel the pain and I loved the connections that were created throughout the book.  I found the book pleasant and very captivating.
 I have not finished this book as yet - it is a tough read for me.  Partly because of the subject matter and partly because of the style of writing that is used.  I'm not sure whether or not I will finish it.
 I highly recommend The Book Thief to those who love historical fiction, prose and a good story like you would hear from your elders around the kitchen table.
 This was sad, disturbing and joyous. What an intense story of survival.<br/><br/>I thought perhaps Max and Liesel would be together after the war, but that was not implied.<br/><br/>A recommended read.
 Classic, WWII story.
 One of the most powerfully moving stories I have ever read. Zusak paints his characters in lines of poetry and grace and one is built up, shattered and built up again while traveling through this historic triumph.
 At first it was hard to get used to reading something narrated by Death, but it was quite a different point of view.  Different points of view were presented and none completely in a bad way.  The book was simply wonderful.
 Great product Fast shipping
 So glad we read the book before seeing the movie. So much detail was lost in the movie (they did what they could with the time constraint.)<br/><br/>A beautiful book about a very tough subject.  It was hard to put down.
 Fantastic read. Purchased for a youngster at church also after I had purchased and read myself. From a youths perspective.  Teaches about love, survival, sacrifice, and life in the midst of hatred and a cruel world.
 Amazing heart wrenching story. Beautiful and original writing. I never wanted it to end. Characters so clearly described you think you know them. I think it should be required reading in schools to represent another image of what WW2 did to ordinary German people.
 The small town in Germany that was at the hub of this poignant story  encapsulated the very best and the worst aspects of Nazi Germany. Altruism and love was bested by fear and loathing.  Nonetheless, the innocence and strength of a young girl and the few friends she attracted made unequivocally clear that goodness can and will prevail beyond the madness that exists in any and every age.<br/><br/>This story is not only valuable, but must be repeated as often as need-be lest it be forgotten that fanatics of all sorts<br/>will always have a short shelf-life.
 I could not put this book down it was so good. I have recommended to everyone. I was expecting a little more detail at the end, but overall is at the top of my favorite reads.
 Wonderfully written. Difficult to read subject matter wise, made worse by having lived throuh that time, but seories such as this need to be told over and over..may it never happen again !
 Intended for the young reader, this fiction explains the reason for the Second World War, the anti semitism and the subsequent holocost of the Jews in an understandable manner. It is a story of a young German girl and her relationship with her  German foster father and a German Jewish man. It is a great book for any enthusiastic reader.
 Very good book couldn't stop reading it
 Even though it takes a while to take off, the story and the main characters - including a most unusual narrator - grab you and never let you go afterwards. There is a lot of sadness, horror and dark passages, as expected given the times and places, but what I found most touching were the little joys and bright moments, including some dark humor that help some very common, but unusually brave, people. Death, as usual, has the last word, but in this case is quite enjoyable.
 I so enjoyed the adventure and perspective of this story. I couldn't wait read each chapter. This story had me transported to the hearts of the characters set in a most horrible time in history. A must read.
 This was a great book! I would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical fiction, but they should also be prepared for a long intense read.
 For all the talk about this book I was a little disappointed...I wouldn't read it again, but I am glad I read it once.
 What a wonderful story of Germany before and during the World War II years. Our main earthly character is Liesel a young German girl who's brother dies as they are heading to their adoptive parents in a rural suburb of Munich. From there we follow Liesel as she develops and becomes literate with the help of her adopted father, her curiosity and nimble fingers.<br/><br/>It's a wonderful story narrated by the Grim Reaper who adds background and describes for us the horrors that young eyes might be seeing at the time. The characters are so well developed you'll feel you know them.<br/><br/>It's hard to give such a wonderful book credit through a review. Just look at the high rating this book has across the span of, at this time, 18 - 19,000 reviews. It's standing the test.
 I thought the book was thought provoking.  Makes you realize what life was like for children in Hitler's Germany.<br/>The authors perspective with the books narrator being the angel of death made for interesting reading.
 I would not want to see this movie as it seems impossible to portray the beauty inside the hearts and minds of the characters on Himmel Strasse in Nazi Germany. Loved the unique perspective and original use of metaphor in this story. As a teacher, I will definitely use this book to teach literature in the future.
 This book held my attention from the beginning to the end. The characters were explored well and the main character was brought to life with real understanding and empathy. The idea behind the book was sheer brilliance. I cannot praise it enough
 I haven't read a beautiful book like this one in a while. I read good books all the time. But this books is more my style. The details, beauty and sentiment in the narrative... wow... it made me dream, laugh, cry. It made me remember about the civil war I lived throughout in my country when I was little. I too lost childhood friends do to a bombing of my neighborhood. I could relate to the pain and experience of a war.
 I  loved this book. It is written so honestly and beautifully that I felt like I was there witnessing  the beauty and horror that the main character experienced. Having "Death" as the narrator was a brilliant approach and it worked beautifully.
 and stays in your mind.  This story creeps inside you.  The start is innocent and from the child's point of view.  As it unfolds, you can feel the growing of the child and the power of the story.  Extremely well written.
 This was a great read! Unlike anything I had read before.  It took me a few chapters to get a feel for the style of writing, but I'm so glad I stuck with it.  The way the author puts words together is amazing &amp; truly unique.  A must read.
 Brilliantly written from a unique perspective, this book manages to talk straight to our hearts and to shine a light on what it means to be human.  With a realistic portrayal of life in Hitler's Germany we are reminded that broad brush strokes seldom tell all of any story.  Life's complexities and unexpected turns bring us all to the same place, a place where we all can take comfort in the many acts of love which appear just as unexpectedly and in surprising shapes and sizes.  The Angel gets my vote for most original and most powerful literary oracle.
 The movie was highly rated (which I did not see) and I was anxious to read rhe book. After three/four chapters I was turned off and did not care to read more,  The book arrived in excellent condition however.
 From Death's perspective and its intertwining throughout Leisel's life.  Won't give spoiler alerts but do read it to the end.
 Great book!  A must read.
 I had heard The Book Thief was a great book. For me it was a little difficult to get into and understand in the beginning until you learn who all the characters of the book are. It was a different kind of read. That is why I'm giving it a 3.
 This is one of the most succinct tales about humanity I have ever read, embodying all that's best and worst about people in one childhood.<br/><br/>What I found most interesting was the narration of 'Death'. Looking at things through Death's eyes was a new experience.<br/><br/>Markus Zusak succeeds, in just a short few hundred pages, of giving us the very best and the very worst that humanity has to offer. Death's closing statements could be the most prophetic words ever said.<br/><br/>If you haven't already, you should definitely read it
 Mr Zusak has given the narrator a manner of speaking that has me saying to myself ‘YES! I get that’ over and over again.  The characters became people I know.
 Unique, well written and gripping, this book is a must read. While it is painful to read about the horrors of war, this story is also heart warming in its portrayal of the human spirit.
 Very powerful, and yet this gentle, frail girl shows us how to appreciate all we have. The narrator is Death, the soul taker, a clever way to tie the story together. A wonderful book!
 Loved it.  True test of spirit in a tough era, tough circumstances.
 A great read and reminder that during the horrors of Nazi Germany the people were enslaved by those whom they originally trusted to bring them out of the depression and financial ruin.<br/>Truly a remarkable story of history as seen through the eyes of a child and narrated by an unusual host.
 My son read the book in high school and had said it was really good. Then the movie comes out, and my Mom read it. She said that is was an absolute MUST READ, and it WAS! It's been many many years since I've read an author with such a rich style. The relationships that develop will burn into your soul.
 this story was captivating. it was written in a way that I couldn't put it down.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to my friends. some bad language is the only reason I wouldn't recommend it for my teens.
 I liked it the sad part of it that all is true.Well now to the point What cought my attention Is who narrates the book of curse I wont say anything that would give the story away. Makes very good reading.<br/>  E.B.
 What an amazing way to tell a story.  Once I got a few chapters into the story I had trouble putting the book down.  I loved the characters and how their lives became entwined.  Highly recommend to anyone.
 Absolutely beautiful novel. Days after finishing this book I still find  my mind wandering to the characters, and I have a feeling my mind will still wonder to this story years down the road.
 I loved the characters in this book. It’s hard to imagine them having to deal with the horrifying events of their time. This book in unforgettable, really.
 I enjoyed this book because it was well written!  I felt like I was close to the main character!<br/>Teen to adults should read this book! If you enjoy hearing stories about WWII !
 beautiful and sad and somehow hopeful.  I love a sad story for the rich and swelling pain I feel.  life cannot be full without happy and sad.  next however is 50 shades of grey.  I had enough sad for now.
 Well written and keeps your attention. Don't expect a "feel good experience" but it does make you think and ponder about our worlds history and if humans will ever learn from their past actions and behaviors.
 The more I read this book, the better I liked it.  The writing style it used was really interesting.  It took a couple of chapters to get used, but really grows on you.  It gave me a better understanding that war is a terrible thing even to the people of the aggressive country.
 What a hauntingly,beautiful story that gripped my heart and now is is impressed into my memory. The sadness of what this child had to endure makes me wish the author had continued on so that we could see her as an adult. This book will definitely be a 're-read'.
 Even though the author often tells you what the outcome of a character will be, you can't help but read to the end to see how they got there. It shows the lengths certain people can go to to survive.
 This book was an engrossing read. Told in the third party by death himself the story was presented in a unique way. The characters are sympathetic,human,and heroic in the most ordinary ways during an extraordinary time in history. The enhanced version was an added attraction but was not critical to the the story.
 ok
 What a brilliant writer!!!! It is possibly a novel to be read twice. The first time to get past the inevitability of the story, the second time to really appreciate the brilliant writing style including fabulous alliteration.  I consider this to be to be a 'grey' plot. For me it was not a story to be read from start to finish quickly. Because of the sadness of the story I found myself choosing when I felt ready to 'take more in'. But definitely worth the effort!!
 This book was has every emotion.  Hard to put down.  Looking forward to reading more of his books as well.
 The book was so well written but I did not give it a five because it was so sad. I did not realize how much the German people suffered during the war. I was just a little girl at the time and vaguely remember the end of the war.
 This is a poignant book.  It left me feeling sad to remember that these horrible atrocies happened to the Jewish people.<br/>I enjoyed the book but it left me feeling ashamed for how humans treat each other
 This is a beautifully written lyrical story that I would recommend to anyone.  Recently gave it to my 13 year old granddaughter to read.  So far, she loves it.
 It's not often that Death tells a story in which he comes across as a somewhat likeable sympathetic character. In this book he does. But this book is not really death's story. It's about Liesel, essentially an orphaned girl in Germany during the second world war, who struggles to read. She becomes a book thief, lives with foster parents, has a wild boy as her best friend and helps to save a Jewish man from the concentration camps. And death marches on and through her town again and again, taking time to get to know the inhabitants, even though he isn't there for them yet.<br/><br/>Death tells this story, he is the narrator, and has a very peculiar way of giving details of future events away well in advance. It's like telling the punchline of a joke and then constructing the joke line by line until it matches up with the punchline. You'd think there would be a lack of suspense because you have already been told what will happen next. Strangely enough there is suspense because  the telling is so leisurely at times you can't wait for the other shoe to fall.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!
 It's difficult to say you love a book that portrays such terrible times, and human nature at it's worst.  However I did love the writing style, and the gripping story.  It was a very moving book.
 What an awesome story told in such and interesting way. It's a very long book and for someone who works and goes to school, the book was spread out over an even longer span. However, it's beautiful in so many ways! A story of one girl's journey through an awkward phase during and unfortunate time. No matter the trial and tribulation she faced, she still kept positive and escaped in her words!<br/><br/>Loved it! Must read.
 As a reader of the Holocaust I found this book excellent. It transported me back in time and engaged me in the story as a participant not an onlooker. I loved the Narrator who conjured up images I otherwise might not have seen. Great book
 This story prodigiously depicts a fictional foster child's journey during Germany's Nazi era and is cleverly narrated from above by the "death angel." It's very well written and the story is moving.
 Was an interesting book and at first it did seem to drag on. once into it it was hard to put the book down and not want to find out what would eventually happen to the characters.<br/>Now for the Movie.
 Great read
 Best book that I have read in a long time. I didn't wanted to come to an end even though I knew it was close. I recommend it to everyone.
 I gave this book only 4 stars because the beginning was very confusing. A book that takes place in the poorest of towns in Germany during WWII could only be narrated by death itself.
 I purchased this book after reading much praise about it.  It is not necessarily my style of book, but I think it can be enjoyed by almost anyone who reads it.  The subject matter is a little sensitive but the story pays off and encourages some introspection.
 Loved the book.  It always interested me in what the average citizens thought about Hitler.  I always thought it was the propaganda and use of the media that changed the way they thought.  The book taught me how important every word that I speak is to who ever hears it and what the Bible says is true....The Tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity...James 3:6
 I loved this book and hated when I finished.  Such pathos.  Such tragedy. The transitions between the characters was so well-done. I recommend this book to anyone.
 Oh, this book is absolutely precious. Read it - you won't regret it. Fell in love with this family and their visitor and how they coped in an unbearable time, and believe most others will too.
 This is hands down one of the BEST books I have ever read!  I felt so connected to the characters that I actually cared what was going to happen to each one of them.  I found myself thinking about the book throughout the day each time I put it down.
 Although I saw the movie I bought the book. It is a wonderful book suitable for adolescents and adults. It is full of history of course but is at times tragic and humorous. A must read for book lovers!
 This book was very moving.  It will captivate you from the first paragraph. The book is very original and leads you in an unusual way.  It makes you appreciate what you have and what things a person comes to value in their lives.
 Just a good book all around. Well written, suspenseful, heartwarming, and troubling.
 a most amazing read.my kindle was working overtime. So many moments his writing style took my breath away. no one else had taken me behind the lines in this amazing way and kept me there.....
 I've read many books by and about Jewish survivors from Germany and elsewhere.  This is the first book I've read (and I'm not a voracious reader) about a person growing up in Nazi Germany.  An excellent read.
 Although a great  premise and a unique writing style, The Book Thief failed to truly pull me in due to its lack of cohesiveness.
 This book takes place in Germany during Hitlers time. It is about a young girls life. It was very moving! It is one of those books that will always stay with you.
 This book made me feel the misery of ordinary Germans at ground level during WW2, in a unique way.<br/>I'm not going to pile on with a longer rave review because so much has been said so well about this extraordinary book already.<br/>It will haunt you.<br/>Enjoy.
 Great characters.  Difficult to put down. Important history from a different perspective -- small stories in the midst of epic events. Using Death as the narrator ... clever!<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the enhanced content did not run on my Android tablet.  But I may never watch the movie -- it would be so hard to improve on the images that the story created in my head.
 Love this book! It's so well written, so eye opening, I love his style of writing. Definitely will be re reading. If you haven't read it yet, it's a must!
 While this book is defined as a Young Adult it is an excellent book for all ages.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it as did my entire book club.  I highly recommend it.
 Product is neatly packaged and is a great add to any collection!!
 Very imspiring and warm story.  Characters were very well developed and it was chilling in places,  A good perspective of the bombing of Germany from the German perspective.
 I was initially put off by the  odd cadence of the prose and the disjointed writing.  It took some time to get into the book.  In the end it touched me deeply.  I would recommend it without hesitation.
 I enjoyed the movie very much-  I do find the book a little slow reading - Its not one of my favourite type books<br/>many other people would probably enjoy more than me.  It is well written and a good story - but I suppose its because I saw the movie first that I find the book a bit slow.
 This is a great story with wonderful characters. Z<br/>The author has presented this story in a format that is exciting, humorous, sad, and wildly different.
 I love my Kindle and downloading boolks couldn't be easier.  Amazon is my go to website for everything.  I have downloaded many books and will continue in the future.  Kindle library has everything and more.
 I was reminded about kindness and it's various forms. Death narrates this story and it gives a glimpse of life in Germany during the second world War. Liesel and Max, Rudy, Hans and Rosa all feel like real people and friends after reading their story.
 I thought the book was alright...I wanted to like it more, and I just couldn't.  For the most part, the book held my attention and was interesting (I think much of that is due to my WW2 literary interest) but it never quite did it for me.<br/><br/>I also thought it was a little strange death being the voice behind the story (which sounds like it would be a great twist if done really well), but the weird statements at the beginning each chapter seemed forced. For me it was a little jarring to read through a shorthand version and then read the chapter with a more detailed account.  Some may like this, it was not for me. Just not a huge fan of this stylistic choice.<br/><br/>I will say that the story itself had quite a beautiful heartbeat through the book at times and I enjoyed a different perspective and story than your typical war experience.  I guess overall I could see this being a great book for a younger, maybe highschool audience.
 This is a novel for all ages.  Not sure why it's listed as YA fiction.  So beautifully written and the characters are so well-developed.  My book club loved it.  Geoffrey's wife again.
 I was quite impressed overall with the book but my greatest disappointment that I must warn others of is the foul language used in what is supposed to be a book for young readers. I have always believed there are more creative ways to develop characters. The use of so MUCH foul language (I deem totally unnecessary as well as offensive) prevents me from giving it my highest rating. I cannot recommend it to parents or youth for this reason. Reader be forewarned.
 Great read, incredible narration, wonderful point of view and character build up. Really enjoyed this one. Would recommend to anyone
 Beautifully written and hard to put down, I am haunted by this book. Hard and harrowing subject matter but the setting is just the stage for a beautiful tale, well done.
 The Book Thief is a memorable book. The layout of the text is dramatic. The narrative is intense and the written form of conversations exquisitely presents the spoken word. The story is deeply moving and an interesting presentation of the profound effects of war on civilian community life. A clumsy film presentation does the novel a great disservice. This is an essential read for people of all ages to experience the pain of war and prejudice..
 My granddaughter talked me into watching The Boy in the Striped Pajamas.  Then I heard about this book.  I'm glad this new generation is learning.  Never forget.
 I have not yet read the book but I did see the movie, which was excellent.  I cannot wait to read it because the book is usually better than the movie.
 Stimulating and evocative.  The narration by death is an interesting twist.  I was motivated to read it after seeing the movie and, as is often the case, found the book to be far better than the movie, although both are good.
 I initially found it difficult to get a reading rhythm. I liked the story from the outset, but the alternating pattern was difficult at times. However, as I read on, the narrative and story became intertwined.
 This book was very well written but depressing. Death tells the story of a young German girl (The Book Thief) left with foster parents in Germany during the time of Hitler. They hide a Jewish young man in the basement. This is their story, excellent reading but sad.
 The ending is not surprising (it is based on history), so I can only give this book 4 stars.  The writer is excellent at describing the characters and their relationships.  You do get a sense of how sturdy the family holds up to the War going on around them and the mixed feelings of Germany.  They never really explained why she was "adopted" by the foster family, so I suppose it was for the cash flow.
 One of my all-time favorite books. Don't want to say much to spoil it to a new reader but I wish I could go back and reread it again for the first time.
 Thoughtful, interesting and worth a second or even third read.  There is so much to contemplate on in this amazing<br/>and unusual book.  Enjoyed it very much.
 The book is all written from the perspective of Death telling a story about the main character.  I really enjoyed the story, though sad.  It really brought a different perspective to what happened durring World War II from the German citizen's point of view.  You see a lot of people reaching their breaking points durring the war and how it all affects them.  It's beautifully written and I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.
 Even though this story is fiction, there are people who did life lives like the characters in this book.  These people lived through hard times and just kept on going, finding moments of happiness in tough times.
 The Book Thief is one of the most well written books I have ever read. The way the author presents the story is captivating, surprising and filled with phrases that cause the reader to pause a moment to enjoy the use of words. The story gets close to the heart and causes joy and sadness intertwined.<br/>The Book Thief brings to life a young girl's story in the heart of Nazi Germany. The thoughts of the Narrator give the reader a totally new angle of  thought. I loved it. This is a book I will want to keep.
 The story was a beautiful one. I gave it five stars because of the honesty and love that is found even in the harshest of times.  It shows how you really don't know someone unless you really know them. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, for it was very easy to read, funny and thought-provoking. I recommend it to all ages. I always feel books like these need to be read by all, because they may make us a better person.
 So many stories have been written about WW2, but I really enjoyed this particular one written from the perspective of the narrator, Death. A unique perspective, to say the least. I enjoyed the warmth of the characters and their relationships despite the expected tragedies they endure.
 Wonderfully done Book. I was lost a bit in the beginning but it may just have been me.  I did get pulled in rather quickly. the fairy tail.rings too true today<br/><br/>young adults and adults will enjoy.
 It was, to me ,a beautiful book in spite of the meager lifestyles, poverty, and fear of death that permeate the book. The language was wonderful and the author puts the words together like poetry or a painting. Highly recommended for adults too!!
 This is an unforgettable book.  The  writing is spellbinding and so unlike any other author's.  Through out the story, I felt as though<br/>I was listening to powerful, classic music.  The characters are clearly drawn and so real.  In my opinion, one of the most exquisite  pieces of literature of our time.
 It was hard to get into because it is written in such a different style, but enough people told me it's worth it so I kept going. I'm so glad I did. Absolutely beautiful book.
 I had to quit reading at times because I couldn't see the words through my tears.  Oh, what a wonderful description of war and the destruction it brings.  God bless all those who suffered.  Thank you Markus.
 This book will keep you coming back to read. I love how the narrator is Death. Anyone from 9th grade up would enjoy this book.
 Never saw the movie but this book will grab you and keep you until the end.  Great characters, great story!!!!  I am laid up for a while and this took my mind off everything!!!  You'll love it!
 This was a powerful and wonderfully compelling book. I was so moved by the characters and feel that this book will help me improve my life in many important ways.  So sad when the book was over. Best book I have read in years. Thank you Markus!!!!!
 This book will haunt me for years to come. Written from the point of view a a compassionate Death it tells the story of a young German girl taken in by a poor couple in a small town during WWII. Its humanity is overwhelming. The writing is brilliant. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.
 .  an excellent read.  characters &amp; situations are totally believable.  it all takes place within a few days, but gives such a sense of that place, that period.  This would be a great book for a book club--so much material for discussion
 It's hard to imagine what you would do if you were unable to read. Visualizing the times and events of this story brings me more appreciation of all I have had in my lifetime. I highly recommend this book!
 OMG.  What a compelling story from a truly creative perspective.  This book brings a fresh perspective from the "other side," of WWII.  Highly recommended.
 LOVED THIS BOOK<br/>I RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE
 Very good read....
 what a wonderful, powerful story. so glad I read it, will skip the movie though. can't imagine it could be better than the pictures in my mind painted by the author. a testament to the power of the human spirit
 Great story. The format is difficult, which makes me surprised it's a YA novel. I like reading historicl fiction when history is portrayed from the perspective of the losers. This book did just that.
 Even though this riveting tale is told from Death's viewpoint, the story is uplifting as we follow a daring young protagonist who has a penchant for collecting books before Hitler's stalwarts can burn them.
 At first I was put off by the story's point of view, because it was cold and hard to me, but it was right. This story is one I can't find words for to write a proper review. All I can say is read it. It won't disappoint.
 This book is well written, easy to follow and hard to put down. Once you feel in control of your feelings, death throws another curve ball at you. Whether it's the gift of death itself, or life.<br/><br/>This is a book I feel could be read numerous times. Thank you
 This book was recommended to me as "a fantastic read", so I took it to Florida for my "vacation read".  After the first chapter, I thought about putting the book down to pick up one that I could get into faster.  I am so glad that I did not.  Once, I got use to Death talking, and use to the manner of writing, it was just as I heard, amazing.  It made me think, it made sense, and it introduced me to a new author.  This will not be the last book by Mr. Zusak that I read, in fact, I am now getting ready to read "I Am Messenger".  Give it a chance, and enjoy!!
 Liked the point of view from which it was written. I wanted to stop reading and keep going at the same time. The author provides an interesting of view of ordinary Germans and German families during WWII. The book focuses mostly on a girl but I think both men and women would find the story an interesting read, but definitely not a light story. I haven't seen the movie so unsure how it compares.
 Great book. Heartbreaking, warm, cold, sad, happy, great displays of human evil, but also human love and triumph.
 So many fascinating books about the Jews in Nazi Germany. This one shows that the ordinary German people suffered too during those horrible times.I subtracted 1 star because the stoy made me too sad.
 This is one of the most strangely written books, it tends to draw on and out and several times I had to slog through it. But in the end it was totally worth it. So glad I finished.
 I almost didn't finish this story. The erratic movement of conscious vs "death" monologues were distracting. It's hard to read if you have a heart or conscience; lots of tear your heart out moments. But all in all, it's a good story and will leave a bookmark in my memory.
 A touching story of that (unfortunately rare) species: the good German. Thanks to Mr. Zusak for erecting a memorial to these strong, great people.
 I usually speed read but that was impossible and it would have been a crime to rush through this amazing story.  The Book Thief is one of the best stories ever written.  The tenderness is raw and heartfelt with every character, but especially Leisel, the main character.  The ingeniousness is using death as the narrator.  I hear they're making a movie out of this novel.  read the book first.
 Beautifully written, funny, touching. I loved this book from word one. Choice of narrator was brilliant. The characters were developed to perfection. I loved every one.
 Wonderful story filled with examples of how humans can really be haunting. The narrator can be anybody or any thing you chose . It was genius . I saw souls being kindly lifted from this world and given eternity .<br/>A
 I will remember this book for a long time. I grew to know the characters and feel for them. This story is haunting and sad. The writing is pristine and beautiful. The omniscient narration is perfect.
 The characters in this book will steal your heart. Each scene was so well written., it was as if you were right in the story. These images will remain in my memory for a long time.
 The Book Thief is one of the best books I have ever read.  It is written in a very different style, the language is beautiful. The story is so very touching.  Having Death as the narrator is brilliant!
 The writing in this book was so intelligent and catching!  Loved this book, definitely recommend!  Written from a very interesting point of view :)
 After watching the movie adaptation of The Book Thief, I decided to give the book a go.  I am so glad I did.  The Book will make you laugh, angry, and heartbroken. After finishing - I found I felt as though a really close and precious friend had died. I will miss them so.
 If you love books, you will fall in love with this once.  The story is beautifully written, and tells us (who live in a plethora of books) the story of a young girl lving  in a society that banned books.  For those of us who  have access to thousands of books and endless information, it's a reminder of the treasures we all possess in great measure.
 This was a wonderful book.  The history of what went on during World War II in a small village in Nazi Germany was very informative ....eyeopening!!  The story telling is superb with characters that speak to the heart.  The resilience of the human spirit and the courage and compassion present in the old and young characters in the book make you want to be a better person. You feel as though you are a part of their lives.<br/>When death comes knocking at your door you can only hope that he finds your spirit as light as a feather!!! A great read!!!
 Told from a perspective i never would have thought of. great story line. i hated for it to end because i had gotten attached to the characters.
 Narrated by Death, this books takes you through the life of a little girl who is living in Hiltler's Germany. This book is haunting and  hard to put down. A bit "choppy" in places, but this does not distract from the beautiful story told by Zusak.
 This book kept my attention and made me love the characters. During a time when life was often perilous they found tidbits of happiness and built a life. Quiet heroics and decency in a time when decency was in short supply.
 Terrific book. Arrived in "Good" condition and on time. Thanks.
 Learning history through a great storyline.  I loved this.
 The novel is narrated by Death, who follows the early life of a young girl he dubs " the Book Thief" for obvious reasons. Of course there is much more to the girl than her hunger for words and books, and we are treated to her insights and experiences.
 Always been interested in World War Two stuff and this book popped up. I knew it was for kids but I figured what the heck. Great story from an interesting perspective.
 This is a wonderful book. I teach it to my Freshman English class. We use it to discuss the power of words, friendship, heartache, and more. The diction of the book itself is not hard to understand or follow. The deeper level of meaning however, is what makes this book a must read. Zusak's ability to use figurative language as a means to make the reader look closer at the text was superb. I also loved the narrator choice for this novel; very unique, extremely smart.
 This book was very slow to start, I wasn't quiet sure I wanted to continue.  Overall I'm glad I did.  It turned into a good book.  I now see its an actual movie.  I'm sure I'll want to see th ed movie.
 I liked this book a lot. But made the mistake of not reading all the way through before I watched the movie... (which I loved.)....very touching story.
 Likely an unpopular rating with unpopular opinions to follow, considering all the acclaim this book has received.<br/><br/>To me, this was a 3.5 rating. I felt the book itself was longer than it needed to be and I found myself disengaged at least once each time I sat down to read it.<br/><br/>However, there are some redeeming qualities to this one. The writing is beautiful and figurative in ways that most writers cannot master. So kudos to Zusak for his unique approach.<br/><br/>The ending also redeemed this one from an emotional standpoint for me.<br/><br/>I would recommend, but I have read other books from this era that I would likely recommend ahead of this one.<br/><br/>For a fuller review, check out my blog later today!
 This book was good but it was a little depressing for me. That is history and what people went thru during the war. I don't know if I would recommend this book but would tell people about it.
 Favoring Zusak's choice of words is my best reason for reading The Book Thief. Besides a good story with fleshed-out characters, the author has a different style here that captivates the reader. The film does it justice, but the book has more details and more insight into the author's writing style.
 This book was advertised as a young adult book. I'm not sure that young adults have enough contact with or knowedge of Death to be able to understand much of the story. Told by Death, this book brings to life the emotions and devastating effects of the war on a neighborhood of regular, 'normal' Germans. The use of English language is strangely poetic for a narrator such as Death. The development of main characters as they grow from children into teens, of the hidden Jew as he wrestles with his past and his future, and of the foster parents as they struggle to survive financially is beatifully handled. Hints from Death of what the book's climax will be does not prepare the reader for the actual events. The ending is like the cymbal clang in the middle of a symphony concert, jarring and, at the same time, inevitable.  A book I will read again.
 But I'm never gonna read it again. I've read books over and over because they were so good. This book crushed my soul. I saw the movie. I knew it was gonna be sad. But it's two thirty am and there are still tears streaming down my face. I 100% recommend this book. But read at your own risk. This book crushed me and I probably won't stop crying for days. Good luck.
 Totally awesome book. Very well written, felt like I was part of the story. Did not want to put it down. I would suggest reading the book before seeing the movie for obvious reasons, once you' ve read it you will see why I say that.
 I could hardly put this book down..its compelling and the story line  held my interest.<br/>I wouldn't order the enhanced version . It  wasn't really necessary.To me it didn't add any demenstion to the story line.
 It has been a long time since I read this but I do remember reading it.  If my memory serves me correctly, it is a story about kindness in the midst of a tragic war.  I would recommend it to others.
 I have not seen the movie.  I fully enjoyed the book from page one to the end.  With the narrator being The Angel of Death/Grim Reaper, the story takes on a fascinating perspective.  This was an interesting and fully engaging read.  I would recommend it to anyone.
 Love this book.  Recommend as family book club with young teens.
 How can one who loves to read ignore a title such as this? it pulls you in with its perspective and colorful descriptions and pulls at your heart with its honest characters. for those who appreciate entering into a different period of history...and for those who love the power of words.
 Amazing book!
 I loved this book.  The characters have a depth that is touched on but not overly described.  The imagery used is awesome and unique.  It's enthralling and thought-provoking without trying too hard.
 In the beginning of the book it was very difficult to follow of what was the book about, but later on it became very interesting and it filled me with dearness of people suffering but still lend a helping hand..<br/><br/>Can recommend it to any young girl as well as matured ladies - they will find it interesting, binding and will love to read. It is difficult to put it down once one gets involved with the different personalities.
 This is one of those books that I will remember forever. Excellent.
 an incredible book-- lovely read
 Enjoyed by a few members of family and friends.
 What a fabulous book.  The story is gripping,but the word smithing is mind blowing!  The images are a thousand times more potent than the mere words.  Do yourself a great favor and read this book.
 I thought I'd read many good books until now.  This  booked has touched me like no other ever has.  A met read.
 The style of this novel involves a unique and mostly satisfying perspective on life in Nazi Germany; it is told from the viewpoint of Death.  The story chronicles the experiences of an orphaned girl through her life with a foster family, friendships, observations of anti-Semitism at its worst and the ultimate personal tragedy.  While the periodic statements of emphasis by Death, indented and bolded, can be a bit disruptive, the overall effect is a poignant telling of a personal, national and global tragedy.
 This is a spell-binding book. I found it hard to put down. I would not have thought that death could be a good story teller or that Nazi Germany could be the setting for an inspirational story. I would recommend The Book Thief whole-heartedly.
 I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Nazi Germany. As I read this book I discovered things about World War II. It was a lot of fun to read this book, and it was also very sad. In conclusion you should read this book if you like knowledge about the world, or if you're just looking for a great story because that is what this book is.
 The book is wonderfully done with characters who are easy to love and root for. A reminder that even in an ugly time, there are still good people. And we can learn from anybody, even a child.<br/><br/>To have Death narrate was a stroke of genius. Especially this particular Death. It was interesting to see the world and the imprint these characters were leaving on it from his perspective.<br/><br/>Very well done. Give it a shot.
 I really liked this book.  I didn't see the movie and books are usually better anyway.  It was good story and totally kept my interest to the very end.
 I really enjoyed reading this book from the moment I started it.  Interesting writing style that keeps you turning the page.
 Such a truly sorrowful yet beautiful story. Every time I would put it down, it would call out to me over &amp; over. I laughed &amp; cried at the same time, for the heartache and the beautiful meaning.
 Narrated by the over-worked grim reaper, the story of the book thief relays five years of a young girls life during Hitler's rise to power. Moving, tragic, funny, redemptive.
 The book was in amazing journey with an unbelievable  young woman-it was such a wonderful experience and I intend to read it again I believe I will still find more beauty.
 It is surprising (and refreshing) that a novel set in Germany during WWII can still be inventive and captivating. The writing felt a little clunky to me, so I can't give it five stars, but it was an excellent story.
 Highly recommended. At first, 550 pages seemed tiresome, but it was just perfect. All the stories and characters were tied together and ended so beautifully. Loved the narration. Not your typical thrilling page turner, but it was so well written that I just couldn't put it down. Wonderful book!
 Just finished reading with a box of tissues surrounding me. This is one of those amazing novels that are so rare to find and such a value to the mind and soul. I'm lost for words. Bloody brilliant is what it is.
 This book will be a timeless classic. The character development, historical references. Everything brings the reader into the story.
 This is a book that you just can not put down.  Tears were shed. You really get involved with the characters in the book. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it for a great read.
 This was one of the best books I have ever read. Period. Pulitzer worthy and robbed. Incredible. Don't watch the movie until you read the book.
 Beautiful book. Felt like I knew each main character like they were a member of my family. Glad it is recommened for young adult readers. Gives you insight into Nazism from a different angle.
 This audio book also is very captivating and easy listening.  You just sit back and enjoy the ride not realizing you are listening to a very professionally done reading.
 You'll know it within a very few pages... I enjoyed each word in this story, only to wish it was my talent spilling onto the pages. Wonderful, truly.
 Wonderful story. As I read, I felt like I was there, living with these amazing wonderful characters in the midst of this horrific history. I couldn't put it down. Amazing.
 Exceptionally well written book ,great story from a unique perspective. It prompted you to think about life and the human perspective. Highly recommend.
 This book was very interesting. It was written from a totally different point of view. I did like it a lot. Maybe more like 41/2 stars. I haven't seen the movie, but I will just to compare.
 I saw the movie before I read the book and I'm glad I did.  It isn't necessary to do so, but I loved having faces before me as I read.  On the other hand, the movie couldn't convey the magic of Zusak
 I enjoyed the style in which the book was written. The foreshadowing/foretelling allows the reader to prepare themselves for their emotions.
 This book was well written. I had a hard time putting it down and stop reading when my batteries died. Will read it again, and will go to see the movie.
 I don't think I've ever read a book where each sentence seems to be so well thought of and deep. There were times when I would be transported to that time and place as the writers descriptions were so vivid and mesmerizing.<br/>I've read many books about or based on WW2, but never from this perspective.<br/>A book I will remember forever.<br/>Marvelous!
 This book just puts you right at the kitchen table with the story, makes you smile and makes you cry. Teaches us to once again be thankful for what we have in this country. No place is perfect but I will always remember this book when I go to complain.
 I thoroughly enjoyed the unique writing style of this book. Very poignant  story told about Germany during the Nazi regime from the point of view of the people of a small German town.
 I enjoyed this book very much.  I had seen the movie, which was good, but the book fills the story out so much better.<br/>I can't imagine anyone being sorry they bought this book.
 This book grabbed my attention and never let go. The author paints a picture with words, allowing the reader to feel, smell, taste,  and be part of this horrible time, with the reminder that simple pleasures help get us through everything.
 I am totally happy with my purchase. When I logged on and requested the book I didn't expect to be given such a choice. I was able to choose the exact article - in this case, a book - which met my requirements and at a range of costs, one of which also siuted my budget. Thankyou very much for your prompt delivery as well. The whole experience was very satisfying. I had thought that the particular book, which was a collectors edition, would not actually be available and I was very pleasantly surprised when I was offered such a choice.
 Delivered as promised and in great shape. It was an wonderful read and extremely interesting. This is a great book to read. The style of writing is different but enjoyable.
 This book was beautifully written, sad, heart wrenching, and magical.  I was totally drawn in and saw a different perspective of the German people during WW2.  I love the way it was written by Death himself.  Very creative.
 This is a view of WWII through the eyes of the simple poor young girl who is struggling in her daily living. It shows the fortitude of all those around her to move forward and see the beauty in life. So beautifully and lovingly done.
 I was really surprised when I read who the narrator was but even with that surprise, it was amazingly written. I cried at the end not only because it was sad but also because it was yet another book that lead me into an beautiful story that captured the emotions of the scenery and that I could picture the events as they were even though there wasn't as many descriptions as a bigger book. Well done to the writer, it was a n amazing story that I will forever remember.
 Excellent.<br/><br/>I read it after seeing the movie a second time, and I was delighted.  Clearly this book really makes one think about the variety of people in Germany during Hitler's reign.<br/><br/>Using death as the omniscient narrator was a stroke of genius. Death's persona in this novel makes me reflect on death differently.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the addition of the clips from the movie.
 This was a fascinating history of the cruelty of the Hitler regime during the Holocaust.  So many parallels for us today in that it seems we are being watched more and more in our daily activities.  It was impossible for me to put down and very thought-provoking! I have already recommended it to many.
 Excellent historical fiction.  Finished it on the 4th of July. Somehow appropriate as it made more significant the freedom we enjoy.
 I chose this rating because it was a really good book. I would suggest this book to everyone because it has a little bit of everything in it. I loved this book because it involved lots of focuses and lots of genes put into one book.
 Hauntingly beautiful. Possibly my favorite book. Interesting to see death as a narrator.
 A story of a girl at the time that was dangerous in Germany. A story of survival and the people that protected her. This book is so good I wanted to read more when I was done with it.
 A heartbreaking story that kept me wanting to read more.  I particularly like that it was told from a different point of view than most WWII/Holocaust stories.
 A story that grips you, never lets go and changes you. Many emotions after finishing this...but mostly thankful to the author for sharing his work.
 This book gives us a look @ a young girls love of books &amp; the power of words!!! It's a page turner with unforgettable people in a time of hate!!! I really want to see the movie after reading the book!!!! You won't want to miss out on reading this book!!!
 The writer's style takes a little getting use to but I enjoyed reading this book. Not quite sure how they could have turned this book into a movie because of the storyteller.<br/><br/>A good read1
 This is quite a moving story, told uniquely by an unexpected narrator.  Mr. Zusak has focused humanity in the midst of a horribly evil time, giving the reader hope in individual charity and goodness. What a great story!  I would recommend it to everyone for not only the story but the creativity with which it is revealed.
 I started reading this book and suddenly realized that I hadn't understood a word I had read and had to start again.  The second time I understood the unseen person and could better understand the story.  What an exciting, heart breaking, and wonderful story this is.  I felt as if I were there with the characters.  I shall miss them all.  This is one book I didn't want to end.
 I have read any novels about this era but have not read one that had so much humanity and clarity about the hardships German people endured during the war.  The perspective of the story being told by death was novel and interesting.  I will.definitely be watching for more books by this author.
 Portrait of a young girl in war torn Germany. I read this while on an 18 day cruise with a lot of "at sea" days. Written from death's perspective representing a new view inside the people's psyche.
 A little hard to read at first but quickly become a quick and heart wrenching read.  Can't wait to see the movie.
 Was a bit slow at the start but I kept going back to it and then I couldn't put it down!  Just received the DVD and if it's half as good as the book, I'll be a happy camper!
 I thought the book was well-written, with the characters described fully.  I also liked the fact that the narrator was Death himself.  What a unique perspective--especially given the time period and theme of the story.
 This book kept my interest and flowed very well.  Enjoyed the reading.  Would recommend this to everyone. Hope to see the movie, but know it won't compare to the book.
 Well, I'm going to go against the grain. This is a dreadful book written in an unusual style. Lots of death. Depressing. The end.
 At first, the book was confusing and I honestly didnt think it was going to pull me in. My husband said I couldnt buy another book until I finished this one, and Boy am I glad he said that! This book was absolutely amazing! It's hard for books to actually pull me in, but this was was great! I definitely recommend reading this!
 I couldn't put this book down.  It is written from the perspective of 'Death' during WWII Nazi Germany.  It is one of the rare books that I actually felt moved enough to cry.  This is a wonderful book, the writing is eloquent and so descriptive that it draws you right into the book. A must read.
 Characters had depth and believability, storyline just complicated enough to keep you insisting on more. It is difficult to find stories of this quality.
 Very pleased
 Life is sometimes not fair, but humans never learn from the errors of others.  Good insight to the hell of war, and the treatment of people who are not of your faith.  Seeing from the eye of the writer "God" made you see death differently.<br/><br/>I cried, I smiled and enjoyed all 700 plus pages.  A book I will read again.  That doesn't happen often.  No war or conflict in history has made much sense and us humans are slow to learn that.  Even today, with Russia and Ukraine, death and pain will<br/>repeat itself in our lifetime.
 It was a little hard for me to get into this at first as the narration scheme confused me.  Once I kept at it for a bit, it was gripping and very poignant.  Am looking forward to seeing how this works into a movie!
 This is a great book set during WWII and is written with a much different slant than the normal WWII story.  They made it into a nice movie...book is much better.
 What an amazing book that will tear at your heart strings! I was captivated from the very beginning. The main character will have you cheering her on the entire way. It is a must read in my mind.
 A timely book for us in the US who care about our immigrants and ex-prisoners in 2014.  We need people to stand up to the terror of "nice and respectable" people duped into hating themselves and seeking salvation by persecuting those who are "beneath" them.  Paul Kelly
 One of the best books I have ever read.  I loved the way Markus Zusak writes and presents his chapters....very unique and he grabs your attention throughout the book.  The characters are 3 dimensional and stand on their own as fantastically interesting participants in the story. I highly recommend this book!
 This book is so well written, it's totally unique and fun to read...and then it will completely expose your soul. My heart breaks to think that this is not just the story of one girl, but really about the lives of so many regular people caught in a horrific time in history. I feel just the same way as the woman here who said she's thinking of people to whom she can send a copy of this book, because it is so special. Markus, you are truly gifted.
 Reading the book serves to remind very living soul they need to cherish every day of goodness. For those now living in the hell of war my heart breaks.<br/>I am a lucky soul.
 My daughter is fascinated with this time period and I got this book after I read reviews of it from others. Such a great story told in a very imaginative way with depth of character.
 This book takes you up close and personal into the lives of people in World War II Germany, The main character, the "thief", is a young girl. The people who touch her lives and the lessons learned are unforgettable. Incredible writing.
 A truly wonderful and moving book!  What can I say that hasn't already been said. Markus Zusak is a extremely gifted writer.  Deserves more than 5 stars!<br/>Was a little apprehensive when I started the book...having the story narrated by Death. Actually that worked really well and it enhances the story.<br/>The book is listed as a young adult book. This book is for everyone who enjoys a beautifully written, engaging story. I loved it!
 It was my second read. The author's alliterations give the book a new, vivid language. I  loved it. Having lived in Germany during the time Markus Zusak describes, I can appreciate the settings described, although my family was sophisticated and never used a "four-letter-word." What bothered me was the name Saumensch, something I heard living in more southern German areas--sometimes used a teasing-kind of nick-name. It jarred me never-the-less. Maybe intentionally, as it never took me out of the story. The movie was equally good.
 A riveting page-turner, could easily have read in a single sitting if not for life getting in the way.
 This tale of life and living amidst despair and horror was brillant.The intertwining lives of those who have and who have not I found captivating. Human cruelty and courage weave a tale which would have been told throught out Europe in the 40s. Blackbird
 Extremely beautiful. The viewpoint of hiding jews in Germany, and combining it with description of daily life in Nazi oriented life was a vey special addition to the many books on this subject, but situated in the Netherlands (where I live), or France etc. I forced myself now and then to stop reading, because I wanted to digest the wonderful book in small bits.<br/>Anne.  the Netherlands
 I like to read about WWII so this book captured my attention right away.  It was a good read, I just wished the author would have elaborated a little more in the epilogue.  I know that's picky, but I would have liked that.
 It kept my interest, but the ending was short and quick with many ends the reader would like to have tied up for them..<br/>Hope the movie does better,but I don't go to movies anymore so I will never know.
 This is one of my most favorite book and I just had to buy one for myself and be able to read it again.
 I saw the movie before I read the book and was somewhat skeptical about how I would like the book after seeing what I feel was an excellent movie.  The story line was very close to the book and after seeing the movie I could picture all of the characters as they were in the movie.  The descriptions were spot on!  I highly recommend reading this book!
 This book will stay with me for a long, long time. It took me a while to finish it because I'd put it down for days at a time so it wouldn't end. My heart aches with this book.
 Enjoyed
 Recommended by a friend. I did not know of it's illustrious history on best sellers lists. I love this book. Never wanted it to end.  So wonderful to read a personal story from world war two from a German child's perspective. I have often wondered how it was for the German people who could not escape Hitler's plans for their lives.
 I wasn't sure I wanted to read a book about such a painful and disturbing subject, but I and heard wonderful things about the book and went ahead.  There were parts of the book that I did find painful, but more than anything I found it was an affirmation of the compassion and basic human decency of ordinary people. It is a sobering reminder to avoid the easy labels and remember our common humanity.
 This book has great style and heart to it. Such a beautiful story. A true classic. Will remember this forever.
 Recommended to me by a teenage friend and found it true to her description as written from a unique point of view.  Movie was good, but not as good as the book.
 i enjoyed this book a lot
 Many books have been written about Nazi Germany but this is from the perspective of the German people who never benefited from Hitler's Germany.<br/>Only The Book Thief brought the love and joy that those around her found.<br/>A very moving story told by an unusual narrator.
 ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND
 Arising from. such horrific times, this book reminds us that good people exist and keep us human.  For those of us who love words this heart wrenching book gives us another reason to appreciate them.
 Excellent
 I loved the WW2 setting, the tired Death narrator, and the first love of Rudy and Liesel. It's poetry blended with a death and life theme while seeing the beauty of kindness. The German perspective was enlightening and hopeful. I loved this book. I'm afraid to watch the movie because there small clips in my kindle version and they seemed lackluster. Read the book. Skip the movie.
 I've rarely been taken on such an emotional ride. Markus Zusak is brilliant at focusing on WWII from the perspective of the German people who we find we're victims too.  I am in awe of this writers ability to tell the story with Death as the narrator without it being extremely morbid.  This is a new classic for me.
 Markus Zusak has examined each word as a specimen under a microscope before he put them on the page.  He has then conducted them like a master conductor and created a beautiful symphony of words in The Book Thief.  A beautiful, beautiful book.
 The style of the book is unusual, and it engaged me from start to finish.  The book is emotional, and the character development is wonderful.
 Set in Germany 1939 - 1945.  A young girl.  A narrator (death himself).  The books she stole &amp; the book she wrote.  Her family hid a Jew.
 Wonderfully good and horrible book.  There r things in the book that I never even thought about happening in nazi Germany which makes it horrible that so many ppl where killed do to a crazy man. The book thief really made me think. My heart still goes out to all the innocent ppl. This is a must read book!
 This was a heavy read from the perspective of the Grim Reaper.  I wasn't sure at first how that would read throughout the entire novel, but it actually lent comfort to the horrible events in the book.
 Written in a style that I first had trouble with, the author delivered a story of such power and beauty of the word I didn't want it to end.  The story of humanity is condensed in a time of such horror yet the core is goodness and counters evil, just as we see today.  A must read.
 Such an amazing read
 Really enjoyed the book thief excellent read
 Our book club read the book. It received a 10/10 thumbs up!  A very moving story with a spectrum of German personalities we had not been offered to experience before in readung about Nazi Germany. Also bought the DVD so we could watch together and see the characters come to life, Much lively discussion! When my 11 yr old grandaughter saw I ws reading it she commemted, "Oh I love that book, I read it last year." So I would reccomend it  for ages 10 + up.
 The book is good.  The movie was not so good.  Get the book. Item was delivered on time. Description was good.  I like the book.
 I'm loving this story, very nice written and interesting. At simple look I though it was a different generation, I hope other lecture give it a try but use is thrilling,  a little bit could fusing at first but with little patience it gets easy to follow . About the version it's simple and very nice format. Thanks
 My book club chose this as this month's selection and it's a good thing I read it this way because I hated the first 35 or so pages.  The tempo was really odd and staccato -- kind of like listening to progressive jazz when you're used to rock or classical.  The pacing was really strange.  I probably wouldn't have finished it had it not been an assignment of sorts.<br/><br/>But oh am I glad I forced myself to keep reading because starting around page 38 things just got magical.  This book, about what one little girl does to get through life in WW2-era Germany is heartbreaking and beautiful but still manages to be funny and surprisingly light.  Aside from reminding us that there were good people living in Germany during the war, what this book is really about is appreciating the little, everday things  and the people we know, flaws and all.  I fell in love with the characters, each of whom was well developed and felt like family by the time the book ended.  I won't go through them, enough other people already have, but I wanted to weigh in on the 5-star bandwagon.  The book is that good. Yes, death ultimately triumphs over all, but what this novel really does is celebrate life.<br/><br/>It's been a very long time since I read a book that moved me this much or had such an impact.  I actually think it might be a bit too much for adolescent readers, but as an adult I found this thoroughly delightful.
 loved it, can't wait to see the movie and I am talking to everyone I know who likes reading to read this, if you liked Anne Frank should read this as well.
 I loved the way the story was told by death! There is good history in this book as well!
 Excellent book. I had not been that engrossed with a book in years. The characters complimented each other beautifully and the obvious yet intense narrator had my emotions going strong.
 Bought this audio to use with my students. The sound quality is great. The narrator's voice and German pronunciations are a real plus.
 This tale, told by death proves that there are no true victors in war. This is a story seldom told of the suffering of German citizens during World War Ii.
 started off a little slow, but became more gripping by the chapter. a very sad reflection on the cruelties that humans can impose on each other. definitely a recommended reading
 Wonderful sad loving... All wrapped in one book! Metaphors nicely and strangely used.
 Book was very interesting, although sad.  Truly informative and what a way to live.  She was a very brave and positive little girl, and brought sunshine in a few people's lives.  It was an awful lot for a child to go through even though she overcome it all  !!!!!!
 This book about a poor non/nazi family in Hitler's Nazi Germany, deeply touched my soul. The humanity of this story, as told by "Death" will remain with me for a long, long time.
 I rave about this book.  It's very well written, touching and frightening.  This is one I will always remember and wish that I had not passed it on so quickly.  I will read this one again.
 This book is an extremely well-written book.  I love the way Markus Zusak writes, he is so descriptive.  As he described the people, places, and events, I could vividly envision them.  I highly recommend this book!
 For anyone whose soul is going to be leaning forward and used up when their time comes...this is the book that you've been waiting for. It's that good; don't wait another second to buy it.
 I had seen the movie first, which prompted me to read the book.  It was excellent and the story was told in the narrative of "death," as if it were a person.  He took many lives during WWII.
 Just read it for yourself, to see WWII Germany in a way you've never seen before, from the perspective of proud germans who don't themselves the unwilling participants in a Germany gone mad.
 I cannot say how much I loved this book. I found it deeply moving, with wonderful, completely believable characters. Such an original concept and written with genuine talent. Easily the best book I have read in the last 10 years.
 There is much sadness in this book,but there is an inner beauty too.The story of a young frightened girl and the people she loved.And the love she received back from them.You will smile and you cry from the words of this book.
 Most excellent book. My 85 yr old mother enjoyed it, and underlined so much, I had to get a second copy. This is so well done that even though one chapter flows into the next, you can pick up the book, open any random chapter, and still get an excellent read. One I would call a classic for the future.
 B-o-r-i-n-g.  The least believable view of Germany under the Nazis.
 It was different right from the beginning.  Brilliant writing. Unique subject matter from a different point of view.  Loved this book even though it made me seriously cry 3 or 4 times.  It moved me.<br/><br/>If you are thinking of recommending this book for a pre-teenager consider the fact that they probably have no knowledge of WWII. My eleven year old grand daughter is reading it and needs some things explained.<br/><br/>But for everyone else.....yes, don't miss it!
 While it didn't draw me in like other period pieces, I kept returning to find out more. It took me a while to finish but the finish was great.
 Excellent book about a young girl with a love of books, growing up during WWII. Keeping secrets in order to keep the family safe and to satisfy her love of reading.
 What an incredible book!  It provides an unusual perspective of a German girl during WWII...told from an even more unusual perspective.  This is a MUST READ!  It is beautiful and haunting.
 This may be one of the most disturbing books I have ever read.  Hunger and deprivation are just part of the landscape.  Lost parents, child abuse and such love delivered harshly.  Is it an attempt to find sympathy for the Germans or an explanation?  Yes there were one or two heroes but if the others stopped the hate and vitriol rather than blame their neighbors for their problems, if they had stopped the violence from the very beginning...  If the test of good literature is some hope in the end then this book deserves all 5 stars
 Wow. I haven't read a book like this in a long time. The characters were so believable. The narrator was unique. The story was captivating. I laughed and cried while reading this book and would highly recommend it to anyone.
 Excellent book, story well told.  I saw the movie before reading and the book but the book had so much more detail - highly recommend this read.
 This is a remarkable piece of literature.  I think this author will be remembered for this novel as it is a profoundly touching story told with beautiful words that are raw, gentle, and humorous. This book is a must read.
 It took me a little while to get used to the fact that it was actually death narrating the book, but once I did realize it, I became totally immersed in the words and imagery. I loved this book.
 I read this and ugly cried on my flight for longer than im willing to admit. Beautifully written.
 I read a free sample of this book because I was bored one day.  Not what I expected at all.  I got to the end of the sample and could not hit "buy now" fast enough.
 My daughter enjoyed this book, we bought it for a school assignment.
 It was like reading poetry while looking at a masterpiece of art. I'm sure it will be a classic and required reading in high school literature class. Zusak has painted a gloriously tragic story of a time in history that cannot be forgotten. I would receive this to all, especially teens. We cannot let a generation pass that doesn't know about this horrific time in history.
 The Book Thief is a story of human awakening. It shows that a person cannot and should not always be judged by how they look, to what position in life they are born, or sometimes even what they say. However, it's an individual's actions that tell who they really are.  Some are obvious, and others are subtle.  The book was difficult for me to get "in" to until almost halfway through. But I became engulfed in the stories of each character at that point, and it became a quick read for me.  I highly recommend it.
 All I have to say is that this is one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. I won't rehash the plot. I just remember thinking multiple times while I read it how beautifully written it is.
 A very good book!  Your heart goes out for the main characters who are children living in the world when it seems hell has taken over.
 This is one of the best books I have ever read in all of my 78 years. More interesting to those of us that have lived an witnessed these troubled times.
 I came to love the characters and the author's mastery of language was wonderful,  It was also a different and interesting view of Germany during WW2 ... it was from the point of view of the common German people.
 I really could not get into this book.  It did not keep my interest and I found myself trying to make sense of the plot, finally gave up.
 A very interesting book which shows how one family in the midst of the horror of Nazi Germany exhibited the humanity that should have been shown the the entire country. One thing that struck me was how the hatred and fear in the country turned ordinary people who wouldn't have hurt anyone into a nation of people so afraid of their government that they let the government do things the people themselves would never, as individuals, do themselves. Well worth the read.
 Using Death as omniscient narrator with an active role in events gives a rare perspective.  Overall a poignant reminder that both sides suffer in war, especially when caused by an egomaniac.
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book and as usual with a good story, was sad to finish it.  I couldn't help but love all the major characters.  They seemed so real to me and it's hard now to let them go.
 I thought it was very interesting story about that time period.  I liked the point of view of the families living in Nazi Germany and seeing how they dealt day to day during the war.  Often you don't think about how it affected the german population and it really touched me to read a story of regular people striving to do the right thing and not losing there humanity.  It gives you a lot to think about.
 Once I got past Death being personified, it was a good story and was well written.  This book gave us a look at a young foster child with a lot of problems growing up in Hitler's Germany keeping her new family's secret.
 Reading this book brought back memories of enjoying the works of Hermann Hesse.<br/>; just a delight to read. The book p<br/>of course is better than the movie. A great read.
 This book is supposedly for teenagers, but I am a 25-year-old with adult tastes and I found this book interesting and well-written. It was refreshing to see an author do something different with a WW2 novel. We read it for a book club and had a nice discussion.
 very well written story and somewhat depressing, though very realistic. The human spirit sometimes triumphs over so many horrible things. Their tenacity in the face of evil and their spirit and bravery make for a fantastic story.
 I love this book as well as I loved the movie.<br/><br/>Everyone should read it for it is a wonderful and touching story.
 This book was good but not as eventful and exciting as I hoped. The ending was good but the rest of the book didn't keep my attention very well. I am usually fascinated by any book about ww2 and it was interesting to see it from a different perspective. Just not my favorite book
 Wonderful book, wonderful look back into history. I think everyone should read this book, older and youngers readers need to read this book. Thank you great book, give us more Markus Zusak.
 I meant to buy this for my niece but ordered the kindle by accidental one-click.  A pleasantly good surprise. I enjoyed it very much. An interesting gimmick in the narrator voice wraps around a wonderful, albeit tragic, childhood story.
 I had heard about this book from a friend a couple years ago. I should have bought it and read it back then... I couldn't put it down. The way this book is written is truly amazing. Everything about it is... there are no words. A wonderfully written, haunting read.
 The Book Thief is the best book I've read in a long time. I love the perspective and the story-teller's occasional, surprisingly beautiful, comments.
 Haunting, compelling and difficult to put down. This is a wonderful book that tells of a horrible time in human history. The humor of the narrator keeps it tolerable, and the characters are multi-dimensional, and complex, so that the reader is always learning something new as the story evolves. I bought this in the Kindle version, but I will be buying a hard copy, as I do with the occasional, rare book I know I will read again.
 ... good for adults as well. A good introduction to the time period for middle schoolers. Not as depressing as it could have been. Very interesting that it's told from the perspective of Death.
 The Book Thief is a tear jerker, a story that rings true to what you can imagine about this time in our history. A beautifully written story.
 And many are here.  Landscapes, portraits, religious, everyday life, impressionist, realist..... styles vary dependent on the need for that setting.  Words used, dripping  the pictures as they go by.
 I really enjoyed this book.  I love the way it is written.  The writer has a lovely way with words.  I have recommended this book to several people already.
 I found the characters well defined. The narration point of view was unique.I was surprised by how much German I  understood and didn't find it intrusive. The images and emotions are still with me long after finishing the book.
 Twas a well written book and gives one a view of what it was like to be a civilian in Nazi Germany during WW2.  Book is narrated by Death, which makes things interesting
 This book touched me to the extent that I cannot find words to express the gripping in my heart when I pick up my kindle and begin to read.  The "realness" of the characters and the portrayal of the horrors that happened during the Nazi invasion paints a picture that none of us should ever forget! A must read for every person to remember that terrible time and not allow history to repeat itself.
 One of the best books I've read in a long time.  While considered a young adult book, it should be read by all ages.  Extraordinary prose, unforgettable characters and a story that stays with you long after you've read it.
 Personally, I loved the story and I though the book was great.  I wanted to read the book first...and I found it very visual as I was reading.  So, I was next looking forward to the movie, to see how it measured up to my images as I read.  I was not disappointed, though the book is far more detailed.  But, I would recommend anyone who reads the book to see the movie as well.
 Really liked it.
 Although it took a little while to become hooked on this story, addicted I was.  Images so vivid, I felt like I was there. This is the type of book that consumes your waking and dreaming life.  A book worth stealing...
 Oh, how I loved this book. It lifted me, caressed me with word pictures, and made me crave each word until the story was told. I recommend this book to all those who love beautiful stories by a real true storyteller and Markus Zusak is a grand one!
 You will not be disappointed with this book.  At first I was a little weirded out with "Death" as the narrator but I came to really enjoy it by the end of the book.  This book highlights the highs and lows of humanity.  It really portrays the strong bonds of love and friendship that make life worth living.  I also loved the historical insight into what it might have been like for a young child growing up in a World War II environment.
 It was one of the most unusual books I've ever read, full  of description that is poetic reminding me somewhat of Pat Conroy.  It could have been darker had he not used the analogous thinking of an adolescent to keep things from being too maudlin.  All things Holocaust ARE dark and difficult to read but this rose above that.
 Just fantastic.  The end
 Loved this one!
 Loved it.
 The omniscient narrator is clever, sympathetic and can offer a critical analysis of the struggles and extreme in Nazi Germany, from those persecuted directly, those who had to abide, and those who were swept up in the regime. The characters had intense depth and the reader is drawn in from the first page. This book is infinitely clever and thought-provoking.
 I read this book because my students had read it.  I've never read a book written like this before, in Death's perspective.  Very well done!
 Amazing story of Germany's citizens that were not Nazis.<br/><br/>I would have loved to know if "the book thief"  and Max were together in the end,<br/><br/>I have recommended this book to everyone.  Well done.
 I don't give five stars lightly, but this book deserved it and more. It was one of the most well-written, moving books I've ever read. Everyone should read this book at some point in their life. Lest we forget . . .
 This is a very good book and so interesting.  Also saw the movie and hated they changed the ending.  I've recommended this book to many friends.
 This book was amazing that is all I will say. Everyone should read this wonderful book. One of my favorites
 When I started reading it I thought I had the wrong book. I had gotten it cheap for my Kindle and the beginning really threw me off.  It didn't fit what I thought the book was about.  I recommend it.
 Never has a book taken me in with descriptions, characters, emotions ... until The Book Thief.  The story is exquisite in its conveyance of love in the midst of turmoil. Spectacularly moving.
 The Book Thief is one of those rare books that leaves a lasting impression. The writing is beautiful, the characters are earnest, and the perspective is a unique take on WWII Germany. I would love to read this book with a group of students.
 This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I have been reading books for over 60 years.  I was almost moved to tears, and I don't cry
 At age 67, I've read a LOT of novels. This book is truly one of the best books I've ever read. I highly recommend it.
 This book begins a bit confusing,until you realize exactly who your narrator is. Once that happens it clarifies. I enjoyed the book despite a couple of plot stumbles. Good read.
 This book was amazing. You know when you are brought to tears and laugh out loud, you have found a great story. This one did all that and more.
 This was a great book!! I usually only read mysteries so this was something new for me and I am so glad I tried it. Will be checking regularly to see if he has written anything else.
 Beautifully presented, this story is emotionally riveting. The power/drive of life can make it through the worst circumstances when tempered with love
 This book took me a few months to read- I would get to a depressing part (every few pages) and have to put it away for a few days.  Force yourself through it, though, as it is worth it!  The Book Thief gives you a perspective on World War II that you may not have considered before.
 This book had me from the prologue. It was so beautifully written that I wanted to drink in all the words (that's the only way I know how to describe it.) The holocaust is something that we should all learn about and never forget, and this book really brings it home. War is ugly and brutal, and this book shows war from the innocent eyes of children. READ IT NOW!
 This book was chosen by my book club. It was very tense at times, I loved the characters but it was so sad to see such young children in such an environment but this is what so many faced in the era this book was written about. I would recommend this book to my family and friends.
 Truly, a great story. The movie doesn't come close.
 It is always difficult to read about Nazi Germany in WWII.  To read about it from a German child's eyes was unique.  It was well written with compassion and hope
 I heard the movie was not so great, but the book was amazing. The author has a way with words and the first paragraph grabbed me and I read everyday until I had finished the book. LOVED it.
 This is a novel meant for children, but it is written so masterfully and beautifully that it becomes great literature for kids and adults alike. It is about the holocaust, a heavy topic for children, but handled tastefully so as not to be disturbing.
 Beautifully written.  I love 'words' and these paragraphs are beautifully crafted putting me in the Book Thiefs' world.<br/><br/>We need these stories to continue to remind us of how easily a few people can control and eliminate a group of people and foster hate which continues today, even after so many years.  This should be required reading for Middle Schoolers which is where bullying starts to flourish.  Thank you Markus Zusak
 This book is a great look at what it was like to live in Germany during the Holocaust. It would be good for young people to read so they know how devastating that period was for Europeans.
 A must read! Great story line! Be prepared to shed a tear or 2.
 A must read
 The Book Thief was a most unusual book, and at the beginning I did not think I would like it.  However, as I really got into it, I could not put it down.  It was one of the best books I have read since I got my Kindle.  I saw the movie and loved it, but the book was better!
 Good book to read though the ending can be readily predicted. the book could do with being about 20% shorter. Was worth reading though especially before going to see the movie that should be coming out later this year. unusually written from a 3rd person like perspective yet they seemed to have a persona.
 Death, the narrator of Liesel Meminger's story offers an effective narrative voice for a tale of the human feelings death is trying to puzzle out and the work that death is given in Germany during WW 2.  The story of Liesel is very moving and captured our attention at every moment.
 This is a chilling novel depicting life in Hitler's Germany and how it affected one family, one neighborhood, and one fictional village near Dachau Concentration Camp. At first, I did not care for the Angel of Death as narrator, but as the story went on I grew to appreciate that perspective. I highly recommend this book.
 A wonderful read. I don't usually tear up when reading a book but this one touched my heart.
 Good Book
 Haven't seen the movie,but the book was very well done.<br/>Amazing how some writers can put you in another dimension.
 An original narration of a difficult<br/>story. One we need to remember. One that's hard to forget. And one that we hope never to repeat.
 A stirring account of the spirit of humankind in the face of the hideousness of war. The story is told from the unique perspective of Death who comes to save the souls.  The last couple chapters had me in tears-- the deep grief of loss, the stupidity of war, the survival of hope.
 This book became quite tedious.  I agree with other reviewers - this book could stand to lose about 200 pages.
 There is so much ugliness, and yet,so much beauty in the world. This book is the great story of human perseverance in the face of all odds. God is good.
 The perspective of the narrator gives this book great voice. I have read several books on Nazi Germany, but none put the impact of the war on the everyday German peasant as this story.
 This book was too slow for me. I stopped reading it after a few chapters. Lost interest.
 A wonderful story narrated by death during a horrible time. A little slow at times, but it still held my interest. I'm really glad I bought it and read it. I can't wait, now, to see the movie.
 Great book!  It is a terrific story that will keep you turning the pages until the end.
 I was ready for just another Anne Frank rip-off.  No Way!  Original in all aspects. I never thought I would even like some of the adult characters besides Papa, ha.  I wouldn't think of ruining your enjoyment or surprise beyond this.  Enjoy!
 Great
 There are some books that I read and think how fortuitous that this particular piece of literature was recommended by a respected friend.  This is one such book. I'd put it on a list of my favorites.
 This book was written with such a beautiful voice and prose. It really captures the struggle of the girl and of humans in general. Not what I would typically read, but definitely glad I did!
 This is the first book I've read by this author.<br/>The author has a magnificent voice. The imagery was breathtaking. This story touched my heart and I will suggest it to the people in my life. This would make an outstanding book club book!
 Amidst the greatest hardships that humans can inflict on others, Death stands ready to carefully release souls from weary bodies to carry them safely to their final resting place. Death is no longer a hated enemy, but someone who knows struggle and strife, who knows you and where you belong.<br/><br/>A heartfelt story which left me with tears stuck in my throat.<br/><br/>A book that I will read again and again.
 Wonderful book about a german girl caught up in events of WWII.  Heart wrenching story, told from the heart of a young girl caught up the devastation that surrounds her. I couldn't put the book down. One of the best.
 A well crafted story line, coming from a unique perspective of death. Opens your mind and heart to the suffering of many who passed through this era and begs the question do we really want to revisit such awful days.
 THIS BOOK REALLY TOUCHES THE HEART STRINGS.  WE CHOSE IT<br/>FOR OUR BOOK CLUB AND IT WAS AN EXCELLENT CHOICE.  I<br/>WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.<br/><br/>FLORENCE WASHBURN
 I ate this book slowly, over a period of time.  It stayed with me no matter the days passed until I picked it up again.  Each time, I enjoyed the encounter.
 Completing story about the strength of humans. Also how anyone can make a difference, no matter who.<br/>I recommend this for anyone who has an interest in that time of history but would like to hear some of the ways people helped each other.
 Kept my attention throughout the book. Had Good character development. Felt attached to them by end. Will try the movie next.
 I've read the book before.  I bought it as a present for a 13 year old neighbor girl.
 Marvelous and captivating story that draws you into what can no longer be "everyday' life during this WWII disruptive times... Couldn't put this book down and would highly recommend it...
 This book is the loveliest book I have ever read. The words used, the syntax, descriptive language were beautiful. I am so sorry that it ended, I wanted to meet Lisl grown up.
 This is my favorite book EVER. I've read it 12 times
 Excellent read.
 I enjoyed this book very much. It's quite different than I expected - in a good way. I want to see the film now that I've read this book. Recommend this book highly.
 Got immediately hooked to this story. I believe, it had an unorthodox format which made it more interesting to read. This book should be read by all, so we do not forget how a dictator can seed hate, chaos, misery and injustice in countries. All I can say to the author is "job well done and thanks."
 Get ready to be up all night.  This book is so cleverly written written. The characters will stay with you long after the last page has been read.  I can't wait to read more by this author.
 This was a great story. I knew going in that the ending would be sad, but in order for it to have sadness, it needs joy, and this story delivered. Like death says, I think everyone is haunted by humans.
 I like books about WWII.  Keeping the stories alive will keep the horror of what the Jews and those who helped them went through, at the hands of the Nazis.
 This book is so touching. I found that it was difficult to read emotionally, especially since the narrator was Death/the Grim Reaper. It was so different from any other novel about the Nazi era. I highly recommend it.
 I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say it is an unusual story.  Unusual narrator.  Did not have the ending I expected.  The story is good, but it drags a bit.
 Good
 Just finished this book and I was first interested when I saw the saw the preview of the movie.  I am always interested in books or movies set during the time period of World War II.  The storyteller seemed so compassionate concerning the children and their parents amidst all the stress of the time period.
 this book has some really special writing features and makes this book more wonderful than it is. it is a remarkable account of a little girl, death and her family, friends and adventures during the darkest time of modern history.
 Lovely story. Both heartbreaking and showing the goodness of people. Told from the vantage point of Death. This is one of my favorite books this year. Watch the movie which follows the book very closely. Shows how human hope can survive all suffering.
 I enjoy reviewing historical events. This was a piece of history seen from an entirely different point of view and a fascinating narrator. it kept my attention through the whole book, too!
 Such well written book. Good for your soul. I loved it!  Powerful and simple.  Tragic and beautiful.  A wonderful read I highly recommend this story.
 I purchased The Book Thief on CD for a long drive and was not disappointed. CDs were in perfect condition and made the drive very comfortable.
 I have read dozens of books about WW2. I have read survivors stories and stories about the children of those survivors. this book has such a unique commentator and story. I loved it. like all life stories it has sad chapters and happy ones. I will never forget this character. Read this book.
 I love historical novels and this one did not disappoint.  A horrible time in the history of the world seen through the eyes of a young girl and another main character I had not anticipated and won't reveal here. I may never be able to see the movie as this book has touched me so and I don't want that taken away.  Characters richly developed and the story told with emotion that grabs and holds you.  I miss the book and it's characters already and I've only just finished it.
 Totally different perspective on the Holocaust than I'm used to reading about. Written from the point of view of Death himself. Loved this book! Get ready to shed some tears.
 I loved this book. Tragic topic, but such a good story. I couldn't put it down in the car even though reading while riding was making me sick. Highly recommend to both youth and adults.
 Surprsing, touching, thought-provoking, devastating yet hopeful.
 The Book Thief was a sad account of World War II as it affected German citizens.  The plot was riviting, but that was certainly not the outstanding feature.  The way the author described words, "she carried them on her shoulder," was original and artful.  I loved the way the children were described.  Despite all the horrors of war, they were children, as children the world over, during that time period.
 Everything about this book drew me in. At times I feel there are just too many books on WW2 out there- just give me a break! This book has a completely different feel. Poetic at times with language that lifts the spirit and see things through a different lens. Well worth a read. Wish Zusak was a little more prolific as a writer.
 A beautifully written book with Death as the narrator. I loved every sentence and character so expertly brought to life by a talented author, Markus Zusak! Well done!
 I liked this book so much I chose it for my book club. I love the way the author (or Death, the narrator) uses the language.  Incredible!  Obviously I am recommending this book to everyone, including my YA readers!  I also really liked the layout/presentation of things by Death--this book seems to set a precedent, and may well be something like what they used to say about Hemingway writing in a way no one else had before him... Yep, this was a great read!!!
 This book is amazing, though the first chapter I had to push through the rest of the book was just fantastic. The writing original and the story insightful. Great story, great writing.
 Written from the perspective of Death, who is much more empathetic than you'd think. The characters are complex and real and you won't want to let them go.
 I wasn't sure when I started reading this book if I would like it. I'm glad I continued. It was one of the best written books I've ever read.
 Great read!
 A+++
 Great condition
 I read a lot.  This book is one of my favorites.  Can not recomenned it strongly enough.  Buy it, you will not put it down.  Be prepared to be captured!
 This book was amazing and I cried for a solid hour at the end. Also the view from death gives it that much more.
 I just finished reading The Book Thief. It was intriguing and very well written. The only thought I want to share is this - this story beautifully describes the pain and suffering of the victims of war, those people who did not ask for war and yet suffered because of the self-serving ideology of evil men like Hitler. It also made me realize the power of words for good and evil. This story left a sadness in my heart that I will never forget.
 Got it for my 11 year old grandson who couldn’t put it down!
 This book is going to be a classic.  Liesel Meminger is Anne Frank-through the looking glass.  Just an innocent little girl growing up in Nazi Germany.  If you don't love this book, you are already dead.
 The Book Thief took a little getting used to in the beginning, but then it quickly captured my attention and my heart.  It's a heart- wrenching and joyous story at the same time.
 Fantastic book and brilliantly written! I felt like I was actually in this story. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is because of the language , some of it was offensive
 One of my favourite all time books. The writer takes you on a journey that will forever be remembered. The intricate details of every character and place is perfect. Beautiful and sad but so extremely well written.
 Great book. Stayed up all night reading it. Leisel is a wonderful character. Book is written by "death".  I personally would have preferred it to be written by Leisel. Haunting novel that will stay with you. Reminisce of Schindlers List. I fully recommend to all.
 Once I caught up with how the author was presenting the book it  fell into place and I didn't want to put it down.  This is the first book I have ever gone back and reread in some parts. A great all around read.
 This is an amazingly written novel told from deaths point of view and it is so heartwarming and funny and sad. You must read this book it is my absolute favorite!
 I didn't think I'd like this book at  the beginning, but the farther I read the more I liked it. The narrator was a bit unsettling at first with his comments and hard to get used to. Nazi Germany is a difficult topic to read about, but the characters become endearing and you keep reading. At the beginning I never thought I'd give it five stars, but it's definitely worth it. It's very unique and well worth a read.
 It was a touching book.  He painted a tender picture of everyday life during WWII in Germany.  I had to put the book down twice because I was crying so hard.  Very vivid portrait of love and hope in the worst conditions.  Excellent book!
 Heartfelt. Well-written. Great perspective. Unpredictable but totally believable. Conjures many different emotions. Makes you consider the power of words. An all-around great story!
 These characters are now woven into my heart. Grateful that my daughter has persisted in offering The Book Thief to me as her favorite book for five years running.
 I love historical novels that engage me and pull me into the life of the characters.  You feel like you are there.  It tore at my emotions and made me care for each person.  Great book.
 This story was both wonderful and hard to read.  Twice, I put it down because it was so painful.  But I had to finish it.  It was too beautifully done not to.<br/>The style is not supposed to work.  A writer isn't supposed to announce what's going to happen before he tells the story, always full of unexpected twists and turns.  And who ever heard of a story narrated by Death, but done with such understatement?  Then there were the descriptions--words that weren't supposed to modify each other.  Prose poetry.  And this also worked beautifully.  Please, no one else try this.  Just let this haunting story stand on its own.<br/>Finally, a thank you to the author for humanizing the Germans of WWII.  Incredible writing, incredible achievement.
 already reviewed
 A story to remind us once again that it is not what yow own but what you do that give value to our lives.  Tears are still flowing freely down my cheeks. In the thousands of books I have read I cannot ever recall being so profoundly moved.  The eloquence and talent of Marcus Zusak are the true essence of why I will never cease to be grateful for the ability to read, to feel and to 're-learn the meaning  of what holds true value in life. My thanks to this author for restoring perspective to mine.<br/><br/>A definite 5 stars!
 Our seventh graders are reading it in English for the Holocaust unit and our eighth graders in the original German ("Die Bücherdiebin") and are excited about it.  Great story with a poignant ending.  Rilke Schule, Anchorage, AK
 Best book I've read in the past 5 years.  READ THIS!
 Really liked the book...very sad in parts, but very nice characters, well written.
 So sad it had to end. Such depth in characters and incredible writing! The points of view, especially the narrator, we're fascinating, keeping me enthralled as their lives intertwined.
 A great book, very intense found I could o my read sections at a toe and had to take time to absorb before I went on.  It was a real window into the lives of all during Germany during WWII
 I loved this book. There are many reviews so I will not reiterate what better writers have expressed-if you haven't yet-just read it. You will be glad that you did.
 I love this book because it focuses on a girl with a good heart who is not perfect. People with good hearts don't have to be perfect. I can't wait to see the movie.
 The Book Thief is a masterpiece of writing. Mr Zusak sculpts each sentence with pictures of inside a soul. He marries words together in sentences that shiver your eyes.<br/><br/>By now many sad stories about WW 2 have been told. In this book the narrator is death. The perspective is a girl in a German town .  The author infuses real dramatic tension into a story structure which is familiar.<br/><br/>He does it with words. The words. The words, oh the sparing, genius use of words. A wine pairing of words to tantalize your mind.<br/><br/>I cannot imagine that a movie of this book could come close to capturing the mystical wonder of words. But then, I am more of a book thief than a film thief.<br/><br/>Please enjoy responsibly.
 I have ever read.  The story is uplifting, sad and desperately indescribable by myself.  I cannot begin to explain how I felt while reading this beautiful story.  A story full of heart.
 I was touched by this book.  It  brough me back to history that continues to repeat itself.  I have always been so overwhelmed by the number of people killed by the Nazi's. It was comforting to think of death being so gentle and so overwhelmed. This is a good story and I am so glad that he was able to share the memories of his family in it.  It is important to remember all the innocent.  I wanted to know what happened to Max and how did she get to Canada?  I especially liked the way he tied the power of words to the power people have over each other.
 A truely personal account of the horrible choices made by poor people in a little town.<br/>A struggle to remain human in the face of a demonic govt.
 Read it, don't watch it.  The book is soooo much better than the movie.  Characters have much greater depth.  This draws you in.  The movie left so much out.  Excellent book.
 Enjoyed the book immensely. Would have loved it to go on. It just stopped and I wanted to read more about how the main character's passion for reading shaped her as an adult and mother.
 The book came really fast and as it should i have prime. The book was in good condition but you can tell its been thru some type of ordeal but in general i have no complaints and i couldn't be happier.
 This book touched my heart, and my soul. It is Brilliantly narrated by the most unusual character I have ever met. A must read for book club members!
 I enjoyed this story.  I have a friend whose grandmother lived through this period and had heard snippets of her story.  This brought all that she had experienced into focus.
 Love the perspective of the writer and the details of life during the times the main character lives in.  Good life, sad life.  a kids life.
 Enjoyed book.  Writer has unique and interesting style.  Plan on reading<br/>some of his other books as well. Trying to branch out in my reading.
 bought as a school requirement
 So they went and made a movie of this book. I wonder how they will accomplish the richness of the characters, especially "DEATH" on the screen.  Hope they don't ruin it.
 Good read. Different perspective than the movie.
 At first the narrator confused me but quickly I realized who it was and we were off.  The book is beautifully written.  The story is a certainly a page turner and the Mr. Zusak shapes each of the characters perfectly.  I loved it.  I even have my husband reading it and he only reads history!
 Interesting read that kept my attention but had a slow ending.
 This sad but true story was very gripping. I also watched the movie. It made quite an impression on me.
 This book took a long time for me to get into, but once I did the story was gripping and emotional. I would recommend it with the advice to push through it.
 I can't compose a review quite as eloquent as most of the others here. This is a bittersweet page turner and could not put it down.
 Very good book.  Telling the story from death's angle was interesting and it certainly helps a person to better understand what all the people went through during those times.
 We all need to hear these horrible stories of tyranny and human devastation and must expose our youth to these historical truths.  Human suffering continues today in our supposedly "civilized"  world.
 I love this book and I am so happy I finally bought it.  It is such an easy book to get into and the writing style is so compelling.
 I loved this story.  Set in WWII Germany.  Well written.
 Amazing read.  The beginning was initially confusing, but don't give up, it becomes clear fairly quickly.  I loved the perspective used to reveal the story which was both traumatic and loving.  Books I love get reread, and this book will be reread probably several times.
 Ha!  you've probably heard of the movie.  The book gives a much better look into the Nazi era from German non-Nazi eyes than the movie.  A truly fine book to read!  Highly recommended.
 Hands down one of the best books you will ever read!
 Excellent book. Couldn't put it down.
 Very well written.  Very sad story.  Really helps you to understand what went on in WWII.
 Loved the book! It was an interesting point of view from Liesel . I was not able to view the video portions though because my Kindle didn't support it.
 Bought this for my husband.  He loved it.  It was beautifully written and he<br/>shared portions of it with me--even reading whole paragraphs to me.<br/>He highly recommends it.
 Gorgeous, lyrical, heart-breaking, life-affirming...I absolutely loved this book.  Zusak is an artist.
 Wish it had a happier ending :((
 It was a different kind of writing style than I'm used to, but I loved it!  I had seen the movie before I read the book and was very interested in how the movie makers told the story.
 If you like historical fiction and novels set during WWII, you will surely be captivated by The Book Thief.  The story was very powerful, to me; and the narrator was so unique that I found myself continuing to read long after I had planned to.
 entralling read...  reader soon finds himself enamored  by a rather impoverished neighborhood ...uneducated residents...bleak life...to feeling quite fond of each character as the tale develops...to a deep desire. for their well being,,,the metaphors are unique and often catch your breath...
 Most definitely a favorite!
 A truly captivating beautifully written story. Painful yet necessary. I was touched and transformed just as a good book should do.
 It took a bit for this to get going, but really enjoyed it.  The end felt rushed though!
 I would highly recommend reading this book, it is perhaps slanted more to younger readers, teenagers or older, but that should not deter anyone from reading this book. I liked the fact that it didn't dwell on or describe the horrible details of the Natzi detention and extermination camps. Also, the author tells this story from an interesting perspective which ties it all together and makes for a good ending to the story, I think you will shed some tears more than a few times while reading this book!
 Loved it.  Had watched the movie, then purchased this enhanced book.  Very cool.
 This awe inspiring narration written by Death grants the reader a perspective of Nazi Germany from a young German girl as she strives to understand a world that defies comprehension.
 Beautifully and uniquely written. The characters are well developed and multidimensional. Though the outcome of some of the  subplots are predictable, the story is told in such a way that it never loses its hold on the reader.
 After I got thru 1st 20 pages, I could not put it down. I bought it for my 13 year old grandson because the lead character was a 12 year old girl, but it was way over his level.
 Wonderful book.  It touches the human feelings of love and acceptance of all people and shows the courage of someone willing to take a chance and rebel silently against authority.
 Great hard cover book, my son wanted the original but really liked this anniversary edition; very satisfied with the product and the fast delivery!
 This may be one of the best books I have ever read. Not at all what I thought it would be when I started reading, but really so much more. This book will stay with me for a long time.
 My husband suggested this book to me. I wasn't sure, but I decided to try it.  It starts off a little slow, but then I found it to be an excellent read - one of those books you don't want to end!
 This book is written in the most expressive manner.  According to the publisher it is for young adults, but it keeps any reader attentive from the start.  It is written by death but don't let that scare you, this only makes the story richer.  Although the main character is just ten or eleven years old, the characters of all ages are so warmly depicted you feel drawn to them, especially to a young Jewish man caught in the Nazi web. The action takes place during World War II just outside of Munich,Germany giving the reader a totally different perspective of history. Although the book is 400 pages or more, I didn't want to see the end coming up.
 The best book I have ever read!
 I decided to read this book after over 20 people told me it was in their top three books of all time. It is probably in mine as well. Heartbreaking, wonderful story that talks about love, sadness, hope, and depression for a German girl in World War II. This book will not disappoint.
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The skeleton of a book is the plot and the rest is character development.  This book was very healthy.  Now I'll see what they did with the movie.
 The language and imagery are mesmerizing and haunting.  The Book Thief brings humanity to history and despair shakes hands with beauty.  I'm seldom brought to tears by a story, especially tears accompanied by amazement, but this story managed it.
 Good people caught in the midst of one of history's greatest tragedies.  Deeply moving and beautifully told.  I loved this book.
 Read in a book club and it was amazing all the little details were picked up from people in the group. I have read many books about WWII and Nazi and the Jewish persecution. This was the first book that focused on the people more than the war.even though it was all around them I liked their little village
 I loved this book .  It exposed the most basic emotions, frailties and yet courage of the human spirit.  As somebody who loves books for as long as I can remember,  this book just grabbed me with the idea of this child  just being exposed  to written language and what it came to mean to her.  I cried when Rudy died in the book and when  I later saw the movie...
 This is a book that I had difficulty putting down.  However, I think it is excellent and recommend it to any thinking and feeling adult.  It is not a subject matter that is enjoyable by any means, but it is a horrible part of history.
 The book is set in a period of trauma, turmoil, and violence, but the characters touch our hearts with their simplicity, purity, and love.
 Very engaging
 Enthralling narrative. Mr. Zusak has a way of getting inside of your heart with his words. One of the best reads I've enjoyed in years.
 Sorry I missed the movie.  If it was half as good as the book, it must have been great.  It's about a time in our worlds past that should never be forgotten.
 Stunning just stunning<br/><br/>Long hard read but your struck by every event in the story would recommend
 I have a hard time with sorrow in a book...but this book was so well written and sometimes a little funny but not much. I was so into the book that I think I read it in two days...
 Good read, interesting characters in a challenging and stressful period of time - enjoyed the narration from a different perspective.
 The book thief stole my heart. This book is so poignant and wonderful it is hard to find the words to describe it.  Some of the characters are so beautiful they bring tears to your eyes. A different take on the holocaust. Written from a small village in Germany and it's point of view. It will leave a long lasting impression on you.I highly recommend it.
 I sit here with tears running down my face.  Reading this book was like being told a story.  The sadness of war but also how the young survive. I would recommend this book.
 Love the story's fiesty young Book Thief!  She dares to read when reading is not allowed by the Nazis!  You watch a young girl grow into a young woman during war time!
 The story is  beautiful and uplifting, even with it's very sad events.  At times throughout the reading of the book the emotions were overwhelming.  The story seemed so real that you felt you were there.  Beautiful.
 One of the best books I have ever read. What is war like for the survivors ? What is it like to be orphaned and loved again?
 So much joy and sadness, mercy and cruelty. It’s like a beautiful, but sad picture that fills your heart until it breaks.
 As you read, you feel it coming. The tragedy looms ahead, but you cannot stop yourself, you must continue to the end. A story of love and beauty set in the most evil and hideous years in recent history.
 Oh this book broke my heart. A beautiful story well worth the read. Very developed character and story. Highly recommend
 The book captured all the human senses. It was a story told many times but focused on the lives of innocent Germans who cared about the horror of that time.
 This book is probably on my top 10 list for all time favorite.  Unexpected humor of death was a big surprise..
 Such a good book.  The writing is poetic and inspiring.  The characterization is thorough.  It's just an all around great book.
 Really great book ... Excellent writing !  Loved the way "death" described taking humans.  I only gave it 4 stars because I would have liked more history.
 A wonderful book!  The use of Death as the narrator was clever.  The insertion of German vernacular with translations made the book easy to read.  The author is obviously brilliant, as reflected by the various devices used in the book.  My book club loved it!
 Great book.  Kept my interest throughout.  The choice of narrator is ingenious.  He certainly has seen it all!
 This story is both heart-warming and tragic.  I loved the way the author narrated the book in the voice of death, making commentaries on things he witnessed.  There was a mixture of tears and happiness in the telling.  The suffering presented of the war in Germany, the persecution of the Jews, the deprivation of the poor of Molching all made the a story come alive for me.
 great story. very well written
 Compelling  characters you'll fall in love with. Great historical fiction that makes the Holocaust hit home. Such a great read &amp; worth every second you spend in it. Super for mature middle school students as it gives them a basis to understand what happened to real people
 Poetic, tender, sensual.  An amazing view of humanity through the eyes of death.  Recommended to me by my mother, who was raised in America by a German father during WW II. A truly great novel.
 This is a good book and I actually enjoyed the movie as well.  I don't usually like movies after reading the book.  A nice easy read and a heartwarming story.
 I loved this book. Superb writing
 I read this book over the course of three nights, but I would have read it straight through if I had not had to go to work. Loved it! And I recommend it. Unique and interesting narrative perspective.
 Just what my daughter wanted, couldn't be more pleased! Another for the collection!
 This is the first Amazon review I have written.  Very rarely have I felt so strongly about a book.  I finished it last night and instantly started reading it again.  The characters, plot, and intricacies of the narrator make this book compelling and unique.  I agree with what others have said... this is a book that adults can and SHOULD read.  I am an avid adult reader who reads 1-2 books per week, including all the new books on the NYT bestseller list that everyone calls "must reads."  This.  is.  a.  must.  read.  Hands down the best book I've read all year.
 Once I started the book, I couldn't put it down.
 Everyone should read this one!  My daughter and my 13 year old granddaughter loved it, too!  Makes you appreciate freedom.
 Good book.  A bit on the depressing side but provides the opportunity to see the tragedy from an different view point.
 This book is beautifully written with an interesting and intense narrative. It moved me, challenged me, and filled me with the life of the young book thief. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves literature and values the complexities of the human experience.
 Extraordinary reading of this book. Highly recommend!
 The sheer power of this book is absolutely incredible. It will send you through highs and lows of emotion and yet you still keep turning the pages. Simply stunning.
 What a neat story! Really different. I love tales that take me to a different time, place and culture. This took me on a wonderful reading trip.
 I have never read a book like this before.  I wanted to read it because the book came out as a movie and I  wanted to read it first.  The Book was written quite differently.  However I did enjoy it.  I would like to have my friends read this book.
 I just finished the book and I can barely move. What an incredible book. It's different from anything I've ever read before. It's clever, captivating, sweet, and sincere. I loved it. I absolutely loved it. I am speechless.
 This was an interesting read.  At first I found it confusing because of time period changes.  When I fully understood that the main character was Death I began to appreciate it more.  The author is very descriptive and sensitive to emotions.  The setting, WWII,<br/>is always of interest to me.  I look forward to seeing the movie.
 While this story is one of tragedy, and a terrible time in history the characters will make you smile, laugh and cry.  The perseverance of the human spirit are remarkable and uplifting.
 If you like historical fiction (especially WWII era) then this is a book you'll want to read! The author is both creative and intelligent in this novel.
 If I could give it a million stars, I would.  I am in the process of reading it twice, which I have never done with a book.  It's so creative, well written and touching.  Truly, one of a kind.
 I enjoyed the Book Thief's unique style and uniquely written narrator. One word comes to mind when I think of this book, human. This book is so utterly human in every sense of the word. For that reason, it completely absorbed me and is the kind of story that will always stick with me as something significant that I was fortunate enough to come across.
 i thought it had a good theme. however, there were a few things that I didn't like about the book.<br/><br/>1) I didn't like the whole between first and third person. it was in the most random places.<br/><br/>2) I felt that there were some spots that didn't make sense.<br/><br/>good thing: good family connection
 I decided to read this book based on how many good reviews it had already received. However, as I began to read, I thought... I am never going to get through this. I didn't care for the writing style to begin with, but I knew that so many positive reviews couldn't be wrong. So I continued, and I am so glad that I did. It is a wonderful book; one that makes you laugh and makes you cry. As another reviewer said, it sticks with you after you've finished it.
 Loved this book. Interesting, heartfelt, funny everything I like in a story. Differently written in style but still very enjoyable.
 I really did enjoy reading this book. I watched the movie first and of course,the book was better. I really liked the movie characters and loved putting their faces in the book.
 This is one book I will keep and read again.  It has such a thought-provoking "What if..." scenario that it needs to be read by everyone who knows the value of books in our lives.
 I had to finish it, yet cried at the same time that it was ending,  We did not often hear what it was like to be on the other side of that time in history in this humanistic way while learning about history...
 This is the most beautiful book I have read in a very long time. My heart was with each character as they lived this most horrid time in our history. I recommend reading this at least once.
 it was a good history of the second WORLD WAR FROM A DIFFERENT PRESPECTIVE.  IT WAS DONE WELL.  I LIKED THE FACT THAT THE BOOK WAS NARATED BY THE GRIM REAPER.  IT PUT A NEW SLANT ON THE END OF LIFE.
 Very unique- difficult at first, then I couldn't put it down... The flow moved back and forth because of the narrator. Still lingering in my mind - I've never reacted to a book like this. Haunting.
 Mesmerising..... heartwrenching! The friendship between Leisel &amp; Rudy was so powerful &amp; humbling. Books, reading, storytelling, friendship, loss, family.........a remarkable combination!
 This was a marvelous read.  Type of book you can't put down &amp; written from a unusual view point.  I must admit I had to reread the 1st chapter in order to know who was narrating.
 It took me a while to get into the story, I think I had tried to convince myself that I wouldn't like the history lesson of a sickening time in our human story. It ended up being about appreciating life and caring about the ones you love. I have to add that the story is told from the perspective that is VERY unique! Who knew that Death was so sentimental!
 Initially hard to get into due to the narrator (death) describing the color of things.  Once these descriptions are done, the book is tough to put down.  Even though "Death" warns of future events they are still captivating and heartbreaking when they occur.  Great read!
 Loved the story<br/>Should be read by everyone.  Page turner indeed. Great author . Sad, but a must read, not to be missed.
 I enjoyed the book but it did not keep my interest as some others have.
 I found it hard to put it down. Very well written about how people survive during a horrible time. Hopefully it won't happen again.
 Didn't keep my interest read it all the way but got boring after awhile.  Not bad but not one that would grab you to keep reading until done could put it down and came back to it
 I loved the book! I especially liked the narration by death.
 A story narrated by "Death" about a very dark time in history.  It is told with heart and compassion featuring characters who might not have interacted in a normal time.  I had my eyes opened and you will too.
 .cvOnce one comes to terms with the point of view from which the story is told, it takes hold and pulls you in. At times the subject matter was difficult to read but impossible to put down.
 This is an heart warming story in spite of such dark settings. Using poetic descriptions the author illustrates the extreme levels of good and evil each of us is capable of when our very lives are threatened. It has been a long time since I've read a book that I simply could not put down; this one became compulsive behavior for me.
 It was a very human storey and showed clearly the fact that there were obviously many good people during those dark years who were prepared to risk everything to help others.  I liked the book much more than the film
 This book was wonderful, made me laugh, cry and remember times in my own life. War causes terrible losses on both sides and the deaths of the young and innocent.  To look at the lives, deaths and struggles of those affected by WWII was eye opening. We must never forget WE are all same.
 Very interesting way to write a book.  It keeps you hooked throughout the whole thing.
 This book really taps into the fears and the day-to-day lives of those that essentially got caught in the middle of a World War.  Pulls you in at the beginning and holds you there.  Very well written and overall just a fantastic book!  Highly recommend!
 I don't like the format in which it is written.  Third person writing in this case did not work for me.  Wouldn't recommend it at all.
 Excellent Service.  Product just what I wanted.
 A good story, about a child and the heartaches of war.  I didn't see the movie--you always get more detail in a book.  A good read.
 This was the first story of WWI that I have read that was from the perspective of some of the German people.  Very interesting and a good read.
 An excellent book written from an unlikely perspective. I as others continue to be fascinated by the events of the war and the amazing power of just one person on the lives of so many PEOPLE!  I hesitate to give five stars because it was difficult to get into the story but once there hard to let go.
 Saw movie and had to read book. Like a previous review, the first third of book is a bit slow, but it build up to a heart-wrenching end.
 I really enjoyed this book.  I thought the writing and the descriptions were amazing.  I wanted to sit and read and read - but - didn't want it to end!  This book is on my all time favorites list.
 I love the premise and the story in this book.  Facinating era and a really interesting read.  Any history buff should love it.
 Very good book.  Would highly recommend.  Sad but enlightening and portrays a story of a life in another time.  Amazing
 I loved this story.  Hans reminded me so much of my Bohemian grand father.  Stern yet playful with the softest heart.  Very well told and there will be tears.
 I normally wont get near stories about Nazi Germany, but I found this cast of characters loveable, earthy, and wonderfully sympathetic. The movie captured the book perfectly and I thoroughly enjoyed both. BTW, have a box of kleenex nearby...
 I story being told from Death's perspective was very interesting. I also found it interested to read about Nazi Germany from the German side, specifically a German family who is hiding a Jew.
 A most fabulous book. Not a fast read but one to savor. This is One for the bookshelf!! Keep some tissues handy
 This was a different book compared to others I am used to reading.<br/>It was a little hard to get into in the beginning.  It is good reading as<br/>the story progresses.
 Excellent movie great topic, unfortunately my grandchildren couldn't relate unfortunately our history books no longer address a very relent part of history.
 I couldn't put the book down.  Unusual format.  Realistic treatment of what life was like in Nazi Germany from the perspective of ordinary Germans.  Highly recommend.
 Picked it up because I wanted to go see the movie, but am ocd about reading the book. Was thoughtful and sweet and sad at times, but a great read. Glad I didn't pass it up.
 Although I found the book profound in many ways, I had trouble following the time line and the premise of the story. The ending was confusing, too and too abrupt. Overall, there were parts I could not put the book.
 Wonderfully written! I loved this book. And I recommend it to friends and family. It's creatively done and just pulls you in.
 I have read this book twice now, it's fantastic!  Highly recommend this book to anyone looking for something that keeps there attention, and a book you don't want to put down!
 This was a great book that was really hard to put down.  I read through this quickly. I learned a lot about the Germany at that time.  I am not a history lover so it says a lot for me to get interested in historical facts.
 What a  fantastic book! There's nothing really I can add to the already glowing reviews of this book.  Read it. You won't be disappointed.
 Good, slow in parts but worth reading. I enjoyed the book, glad I read it but wouldn't recommend to everyone, depressing and slow  the ending was worth it
 I couldn't put this book down and am looking forward to seeing the movie. I'm not a great fan of war or holocaust stories but this one was held my attention until the very end.
 very good book, love the sort line. I'm a huge fan of historical fiction.
 The majority of the movie followed the book but the ending was a very different story which was a little disappointing in itself. Other than that, the film has wonderful actors,  superb soundtrack, and a magical ambience to it.
 The narrative style is unique and enjoyable.  It will make me think about colors now in relation to situations.  An interesting twist.
 The writing style is a little strange and took a minute to get used to. After that this book was glorious! Tragedy, triumph, joy, pain, love, hate; it explores them all and weaves them into something magical.
 It had a weird beginning.  I'm not too far in yet, but its more a story now.  The guy who wrote it writes as he is there.<br/>The book thief doesn't know how to read.  She didn't get to school much, her brother died and then her mother left her at a house.  The lady isn't nice.  The man is nice.  She likes him.<br/><br/>Anyway, it does take a bit to get into the book.  I'm not sure I will finish it.  But then again I'm reading 3 books, so I don't read it much.<br/><br/>Debbie
 I was sad when this book ended.  Such a tragic story on a very real subject.  You will fall in love with the characters.
 The Book Thief deserves 5 stars! All you have to do is read the first page to know that Markus Zusak will keep you on your toes throughout, The Book Thief!<br/><br/>The mysterious 3rd person point of view is like nothing I've ever read, and the fact that you get to see World War 2 through the eyes of Germans that did not support Hitler is even better!<br/><br/>There is no boring moment while reading, The Book Thief! Oh,and the ending...lets just say...it's to die for ;)
 I didn't want to read a book about Germans during the Holocaust and I avoided this book for a long time.  I finally read it and it was tender and went to my heart.
 Hard for me to get into the story. There are a lot of  alternating  characters.
 Loved this book. The story of this young girl's love of books is very moving. It should be required reading in every classroom. Adults will enjoy this
 Excited now to see the film. Book moved along and is a well-crafted tale. The narrator's point of view is especially intriguing.
 My sister wanted this for Christmas, and she loves it!
 This book is a wonderful read. It is difficult and sad yet truely a work of art. The,author uses words that roll off the pages. I would recommend it to all those who love a great book.
 I think this book is a classic.  Loved the characters. Rudy is my favorite.<br/>I like how the book is about people living in small town Germany during WWII.
 Saw the movie after I read the book.  The book was better, although the movie tried.  The character development was so much better in the book.  Being an avid reader, I understood her thirst for more.
 Being a high school teacher I read a lot of Teen novels, I found this one to be one of the best I have read in years.  It is cleverly written from a unique person telling the story. I would recommend it to any age between tween to grandparents.
 I never thought I would read a book that moved me like Sophie's Choice, but The Book Thief did it for me.  I loved the characters and the story.  I guess it is a dark tale, but there is something uplifting about it.
 The book was very interesting and I thought somewhat intense for the young readers and didn't know if they would actually comprehend all that the book had to offer.  I was a little disappointed that some of the characters after the war were not explored further.  Overall, an absorbing read.
 I purchased this book after reading many of the positives reviews and I'm glad I did. This is a great book that is an easy read, but not because of simplicity in writing...you just don't want to put it down. Great emotion and depth of the characters and I love how "Death" narrates the story. I think that is one of the reasons why this book is really effective. I highly recommend!! (I've lent it out to two friends and they also fell in love with it.)
 This novel touched the very core of me.  My Uncle was captured by the Germans during WW II.  He was put into one of their prison camps, starved and beaten everyday.  He survived luckily, until the end of the war.  The little Nazi, how, why, so many lives.
 Couldn't put it down. I haven't watched the movie because the book was so very good I don't think they could have done it justice!
 It took a bit of time  to get comfortable with the narrator's voice, but once I was able to appreciate the unique perspective, I  really enjoyed the book tremendously.  Very creative and moving.
 I loved this book, iT has the full spectrum of life and death wonderfully blended into one book<br/>A very different perspective
 A striking reminder that war rips everyone apart, that the human race is resilient, that love and compassion set us apart.
 This book is an amazingly written story of life and the resilient human spirit of a young girl as she endures its reality and harshness. There are many authors out there but some just have a gift of turning words into a spirit moving adventure and that is what Mr. Zusak has done. This is a must read and must share novel.
 It's looks very new.
 I was not expecting this to be a war story and stopped reading.  So glad I went back and finished.  A book you can't put down once your into it.  Well written, plenty of happy and sad moments.  Another look at the horrible casualties of war.
 With death as its narrator this is a uniquely told book that transported me back to the horror of Nazi Germany and a young girl there who is trying to make sense of a senseless time.
 This book is right up there with The Diary of Anne Frank.  It was written from an interesting perspective which I found unique and very good.  Easy to follow.  Depicts history as accurately as possible.
 At first I was put off a bit by the narrator but as the story evolved the more I became involved with the characters. Excellently written. Unique in its presentation. Thought provoking and insightful.
 I didn't want it to end. I'm going to read it again and watch the videos again.  I can't wait to see the movie.<br/>I really enjoyed the extras - especially the interview with the author and the movie trailer.
 I would like to reccomend this book to all those interested in World war 11. Wonderful and inventive style of writing by Markus Zusak,I can't wait to see the movie.
 Perhaps these words would inform better in a film where facial expressions help to endear you to the girl.  Or perhaps I have read one too many second WW books.  In my opinion, the author's  pov (death) belittles the grave nature of those times.
 I loved this book.  I could not stop thinking about it for weeks afterwards.  It is powerful and evokes a deep emotional response.  I can't wait to see the movie.
 This is a good book and a great story. It didn't keep my attention the entire time and as a result I was slightly confused for a bit. But, that's not the books fault. This story opened my eyes to a world I couldn't imagine. I didn't breeze through it, but I'm certainly happy I read it. I would recommend this book to adults and teens. Give it a read.
 I think the book is really interesting. Sometimes it drags a little, but really a very endearing story of a small little girl who really grows up too fast during and in Nazi Germany.
 A very touching and personal account of a German girl's take on the end of the war in Germany<br/><br/>I loved the mixture of reality and fantasy.<br/>Our lives should be lived somewhere between the two to allow the magic it's rightful place<br/>Not totally convinced that I liked to be told the outcome before the events
 When I first approached the book, my reaction to was that it was very "stylized."  However, as I read it, my reaction changed so that I saw it as "stylish."  Everything about this novel is different. The characters are so well portrayed, with such authenticity, that I felt they were friends and neighbors.  The story, while taking place during a time period I don't enjoy reading about, is extraordinary in that it is largely told through the voice of Death -- who makes no judgments.  This book is so different and so rewarding that I rated it a 5 and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys modern literature.
 I read this to see if my Grandchildren would like it and found that I liked it myself.  A very human story of good and evil with a clever narrative style.  A worthwhile read.
 While I was initially put off by the character of the narrator and a bit slow going at first...the story quickly pulled me in and kept me enthralled to the end. Loved the movie clips posted on my Kindle at the end of some sections.
 An easy read, but oh so full of material.  The story is so vividly written that you'll feel everything Liesel is going through and understand so much more of what went on during that time.
 I was pleasantly surprised with this story. It was moving and beautiful and unforgettable. This is a story that will stay with me for life.
 As an avid reader and a struggling writer, I have the same love/hate relationship with words that Liesel did, but nowhere near the inhuman, impossible circumstances she endured. This book broke my heart. I will never understand man's inhumanity to man. An unforgettable story.
 One of the best books ever written.  It's one of those books that any writer wishes they had come up with the idea.  Very ingenious!  A sad, but very real account of life in Germany during World War II.
 Read this as ebook (on my phone screen) but without the satisfaction of holding the book in my hands, the author created a palbable world of the families in a German town living under Hitler. Book readers can't help loving the thief and her friend riding their bikes to climb in the study window of the mayor's house.
 I enjoyed the content and the writing style was creative and interesting.  It's the kind of book that I must finish but was able to stop and fulfill my daily tasks.  It totally kept my attention without being riveting.  It was kind of like having a good friend that I could look forward to visiting again at my convenience.
 This book is amazing. It's confusing at first, but absolutely amazing.<br/>The ending will probably kill you, but don't let that stop your from reading this book. Just do it. Read it.
 This book was not at all what I expected. Yes, it is well written, but it draws you in,(in my case slowly). I was prepared to be served the "same old" syrupy tale.  Wrong!! Iit held my interest and is written from a much different point of view than I expected.
 Leisel, a young child facing the loss of those she loves during Nazi Germany, finds solace in words that are her friend and her enemy. A touching revelation of human kindness during a very dark time in Germany's history. Despite the blackness of war there are often shining yellow suns of kindness and love. A story worth rereading!
 Different, in a word. This author writes quite differently. It's hard to follow in the beginning until you catch the author's rhythm. You may be tempted to stop reading, but don't. This author definitely has learned the secret of all great authors: the supreme power of the pen over the sword. And this story exemplifies this truth best through its protagonist and heroine, The Book Thief.
 Having lived through this era my memories are vivid. This book encapsulates this dark era in Europe. I would recommend this read<br/>for a true time in our recent history.
 This is a book that everyone should read. A beautiful story with a wonderful message
 I cannot recommend this book enough. It is both happy and sad, uplifting and earth shattering. I am an avid reader, have read hundreds, if not thousands of books, and this one will stay with me, I'm sure, for a very long time.
 I've read  the book and also seen the movie - since I come from Europe - it brought back some memories - no more war books for me for a while..  I did like it - very good writing.
 It took me three days to read this gripping and satisfying story. I gave myself a headache from crying and keeping my eyelids open to continue reading. The book thief puts a hole in your heart.
 One of the best books I've read...makes me angry all over again for the horrid mistreatment of the Jews.  Racism is so ugly.  Well written..I may start over at page 1 right now.
 I didn't care for the writing style of the author at first but I continued on and was very glad I did. It was an enjoyable book. I would recommend the book.
 This story was an interesting perspective of death and what a time to do it in but ww2. Loved it
 I didn't really know what to expect when this book was selected for our Book Club, but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. The characters were so realy to me, I felt I knew them and could understand their feelings. A very different perspective of what some good german people went through. Everyone should read it.
 There's a reason this book is award winning. It is truly an amazing book. I laughed, cried, and truly bonded with the characters of this book. It is a must read for anyone who wants to see a different perspective on WWII and how it changed the lives of all involved.
 I liked this story but it was hard for me to read it consistently . Anyone interested in historical fiction, this is a very good story.
 Heard ths was required reading in some schools now instead of Shakespear. It's a great book, but I'm not sure it is a classic.
 I won't tell you about the story, but I will tell you that it's a good story, well written, and that if you haven't read it yet you should.
 Perfect book for both the young and old. What an amazing way to narrate a book (you have to read it to understand what I'm saying)!
 An easy, yet emotional need. The interviews from the author were interesting and added a lot to the book club discussion.
 Very interesting writing form and I could actually visualize so much from the descriptions!
 Absolutely brilliant.  This is the type of book that will stick with you forever.  I don't know if it is being used as classroom reading material anywhere, but it would be perfect for that, whether for literature or for history class.
 The way the story started made it difficult for me to "get into" the book.  When I finally realized who was telling the story, it came together.  I enjoyed how the story followed the history of what happened during Hitler's rule and how it was told from a family's eyes and yet the story teller told the overview of what was happening to all the people.  I gave it a 4 star rating because I did not like the way the story started out and the who the "story teller" was.
 It's inventive. It's smart. It makes you think, laugh, cry. Very much like another favorite book of mine Prayer for Owen Meany. I really, really liked this book.
 A very unusual book but very good.  It passes the "could it really have happened" test.  Except for the occasional comments by the narrator, the story, or something very close to it probably did happen.  The narrator pops in and out with interesting viewpoints of human happenings.
 Loved it!
 Very intriging. Kept you thing more about the Nazi empire. Loved the interaction between Father and the daughter. I also saw the movie which I just saw after reading the book.
 By far the best book I've read about the WWII years in Germany and one of the best books I've ever read!!  I highly recommend this book!
 HIGH SCHOOL SUMMER READING, GREAT BOOK, FAST DELIVERY
 Purchased as a gift for my granddaughter (tween). She liked it!
 Let just say that I cried, laughed, was addicted to and enjoyed this book very much. This is such a great story with such amazing characters that this is a very very worth while read...
 A story of WWII in a new point of view that will leave you both intrigued and horrified at the breadth of the suffering that Germans endured whether they were Jew or Gentile.
 Great book. I had a hard time at the start of the novel due to the unusual style of the author. But after the first 50 pages I was in to the characters and writing technique and loved the book. E
 I liked the author's choice of using the figure of death to narrate the child's story.<br/>Books keeps readers interest of wanting to stay on the story. A book that I wanted read cover to cover because each<br/>Person was muti-demential. In some ways those  beautiful moments between the children made the terror of living through the war a way to keep hope alive for a time when guns and bombs were the stuff of dreams.<br/>I would recommend this book to anyone who loves history told in a great novel.
 This is one the best gooks that I read this year.  The main characters were so believable, and the struggle of the lower class German people during the war was something that I had not realised.
 Kept me on the edge of my chair the whole ride! Very well written and the characters are so nicely developed you want to meet each one! Such a poignant story and beautifully told.
 Once the reader figures out who the narrator is, the story unfolds to its logical conclusion.  The book thief is a thoroughly  believable character growing up in Nazi Germany.  Despite the ugliness of war, the inherent goodness of so many people shines through.  I would recommend this book for high school students and all adults.
 Unfortunately I saw the movie first.  The movie was so close to the book.<br/>Enjoyed reading the book and loved the ending, even though parts were very<br/>sad.  That is life.
 Yet another story set in Nazi Germany, but what an original telling. It was such an interesting perspective and so moving. I read the last parts through tears both sad and happy. Make sure you have a tissue handy.
 So well written!  I got so drawn in to the characters and their daily life, it was hard to put it down.  The author's descriptions of life for the average people in Natzi Germany during WWII made you feel that you were there.  Told from the view point of the Angel of Death, wow.
 I was confused at first.  When I realized the story is told by Death, it became compelling. We wonder how the intelligent populace of 1930s Germany could have let Hitler get away with his decrees.  This is one explanation, in a well told story.
 This is a book I will read again. It was a page turner, it made me cry and I loved Markus Zusak's writing style. I would recommend this book not for jsut young adults but for adults too.
 I never read books based in war Times but I am very thankful I was talked into this one! It is written in a way I truly appreciate, especially the character of the narrator (very clever and thoughtful). I can honestly say this will stay as one of my top 10 favourite books!
 It took me a while to get into this book.  I wasn't a big fan of the writing style.  But, I loved  the story.  I loved the unquestioning love between the book thief and her foster parents.  And  it was a testament to the value of the ability to read and write.
 Truly an amazing story.  The depth of characters, the graphic depiction of life for common citizens in Nazi Germany and the willingness to be human in the face of fear make this a remarkable read for YA and adults alike.  I highly recommend it.
 Markus Zusak does a wonderful job in this enjoyable read.  So well written, with historical facts and truly believable characters, I highly recommend this interesting read.
 Do I recommend this book to my friends? Definetely yes. It's not easy to read if we talk about content (death, war) but it's worth it. I'm sure you won't regret.
 Amazing book. The movie doesn't do it justice. Read it!
 A wonderful story well told
 It's been a long time since I've read a story this enchanting. I told my fiance that reading it was like chocolate to my ears. The descriptions were so vivid, almost symphonic. And the narrative from the perspective of death, so thoughtful. I loved this book, will most certainly read it again and cannot wait to read more from this illustrative author.
 I enjoy reading books about WW2 and how people coped with all the craziness<br/>going on in Europe.  The Book Thief kept my interest from the start and I finished<br/>it in a few days.
 Here is another Holicaust story from a completely different viewpoint. I really enjoyed it. No one really writes about the other people that were affected by the times.
 This is a wonderful historical fiction book from the WWII era but with a new perspective that I have rarely seen.  The perspective of the German people and what they were dealing with as the tragedies around them unfolded.  The narration is also from a very unique perspective... Death.  Unfortunately he is very busy during WWII.  The stories of the German people: Nazi's, non- Nazi's, and Jews meld into a tale of survival, death, and the wonder of the human spirit.  Excellent read.
 Even if you saw the movie you need to read this book! It will touch your heart - and open your eyes. Highly recommend.
 Everything about this book is engaging, from the subject matter to the interesting way in which Zusak uses metaphors to describe nearly every aspect of the setting.  Couldn't put it down.
 Writing!! It is such a gift. Not all authors possess this gift this author does. You see the good side of human beings and the dark side, the good that words can do and the harm. Reading this book was a true experience. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.
 I listened to this in my car driving back and forth Truckee/Sedona.  It kept me wide awake! for the entire trip
 Loved the book now I can't wait to see the movie.  It was sad, happy at times and it shows you what people are really made of.
 In every story involving Nazis, there could be no darker &amp; evil force other than the devil himself. Even the narrator, Death, weeps at German atrocities, which we experience through a delightful and spunky orphaned girl. I was emotionally drained yet sorry when this story ended.
 Really liked this. But now I need to read a light and happy book.
 I haven't read it yet.  Saw  the movie and looking forward to reading it.  I can say that the product arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect condition!
 Love it.  Arrived quickly.  Summer reading for my grandson.
 Very powerful and sad and wonderful.  Thought provoking!
 Sad book about Holocaust.
 An Epic piece of literature.  So rare does a book capture a tragic time in history from such a unique perspective and in such a poetic way.  Should be read by everyone.  I kept marking the pages where the phrasing was so lyrical and well written - so I could go back and re-read it - ended up marking numerous pages. Definately goes on my Top Shelf where only a select few of my all time favorites are.  Seems like the author was born to write this piece of art to share with and move the world.
 An excellent read for all who love to read and would go crazy if they could not.  At times when the narrator jumps in the flow skips a beat.  A wonderful story of perseverance.
 The story is haunting and sad . One wonders how people, humans can be so terribly cruel and others so silently caring.  You want to understand but it is so hard to fathom.
 Just a great read!  Takes the reader on a tour of humanity in an inhumane time. Great character development. I simply loved it.
 I loved the intriguing storyline...especially the characterization of "death". The writing, so lyrical and engaging, was a pleasure to read. If I had one negative critique it would be that the narritive ended far to early leaving me hungry for more details. However,  this could have easily been the author's intention. The book is catorigized as juvenile fiction, but at 53 years young, I loved it.
 I'm really liking this book. It is grim because it is about a small German village during WW 2. The story centers around a young girl living with a foster family and the issues of life in Germany among the those who had to follow Hitler's government.  The family is hiding a Jewish man in their basement  which also adds to the complexity of the story.The narrator of the story is Death so the story is told from his POV.
 A good book but a little too drawn out.  The subject matter was, of course, important.  I just thought the story was at times repititious.  Definitely a worthwhile read.
 I couldn't put it down.
 This story seemed true to life for several German children living through WWII.  It depicts the prevailing spirits of good people who were trapped in circumstances beyond their control.
 The ending of this book was easily one of the best I have ever read. The middle of the book was a little slow moving but the plot itself interested me... Sometimes with this topic, you find predictable endings or characters. But the "The Book Thief" had original plot twists relating to World War II, which I find hard to keep readers interested in. Kudos to Zusak for keeping me on the edge of my seat, being that I've read probably 4 or 5 novels depicting the same topic.
 This was an interesting, enjoyable book which kept your interest to the end. It was eye-opening too because we don't often think how the German citizens were suffering through Hitler's madness.
 It took a while for the book to consume me but when it did I was overwhelmed.  I am going to read it again so I remember every detail.
 Had this book on my kindle for some time; sorry that I didn't read it sooner.  It is a haunting story, very well written.
 Although the main characters are children this is a book that adults will also find interesting. I liked that it is narrated by death in a sort of grim reaper character.
 I chose this book to read for a book club with high school students. It gives us many things to talk about and discuss.
 This is a great book for young readers who would like to learn more about World War two. This book should be followed by discussions and more research on the history of the Holocaust.
 Such a gorgeous anniversary copy. Much bigger than I expected, but absolutely beautiful. Can't wait to read!
 While I had a hard time getting into this book, I could not put it down midway through. The journey this books takes you on is beyond frightening and unbelievably sad. Strongly recommend that you read it!
 A beautifully told story of a young German girl, Leisel, during the 2nd World War. The story is narrated by 'Death', and a stunningly written book. This is a book I've recommended to many others to read - loved it.
 Heart rendering account of the Nazi years in a small German town.  The Jews were not the only victims of this tragic period.  The average German citizen paid a terrible price as well.
 At first I was not certain that I liked this writing style,but I think the book is incredible and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  lots of great quotes and excerpts and characters you truly love.
 I absolutely loved reading The Book Thief.  It was able to clearly let the reader see what it was like for a little German girl  living during the war.  You were able to live the war through her.  Excellent read and I would highly recommend.
 Loved this book!  I was so impressed with how this story is so creatively crafted--telling a dark tale from the worst period in human history--all from the spirit of death's point of view.  Excellent writing!
 Great book - couldn't put it down!  The movie was good, but the book is excellent.  Highly recommend.
 I was touch how people cared for others in spite of what risk they put on their lives.  For me this is the sign of true love for mankind, would I be as brave as that I wonder.
 Everyone should read this book. The movie was excellent too. I felt I was really in this place &amp; time and I fell in-love with the main characters.
 This book sheds light on the compassion of common people during war and should be read by as many people as possible.  An important work with a beautiful, interesing story containing miniature graphic novels as part of the story.  Wow.
 This book touched my heart in a way that other war stories haven't got close to. The author shows the reader the brutality and the insanity the German people (including the Jewish people) went through during WWII through the eyes of a scared and confused child. He is brilliant in the way he allows us to feel their struggle in trying to make sense of a senseless war. The book is both heart warming and heart breaking at the same time. It's an excellent book that everyone should read.
 The point of view of death as the narrator should have been frightening....yet it wasn't. Death was not portrayed as a scary figure at all.<br/>This story was told in such a way that I could actually feel the angst of death taking the souls. The horror of nazi Germany was conveyed in a personal tone through the voice of death as he/ she witnessed the carnage. I felt for the characters and the writing was superb. A must read.
 "death" is telling the story of  the holocaust from the viewpoint of a German girl who is protecting a young Jewish man...very great historic perspective, and the movie followed the book very closely
 wonderful book
 Powerful and engaging story set in WWII Germany.  I cried, laughed, cried some more and felt my heart open to the complexities of the human spirit.
 this was so good.  I couldn't put it down. the video clips were awesome.  Markus Zusak is really good, I felt like I was there. really worth the money for this book!
 Beautiful book. Was a little disappointed when I got toward the end only because it meant I was almost done. Looking forward to watching the movie.
 This is by far the most memorable story I have read in a long time. I saw the movie and it was done very well, close to the storyline. All of the characters are still in my head, I will keep this book in my Kindle to have for reading again and maybe again
 What a unique way to give readers a look at life in Germany during WWII--the difficulties, the small joys, and the capacity to survive under difficult circumstances.  An exquisite story!!
 Beautiful, sad, heart-wrenching and unique all wrapped into one incredible tale.
 This book brought to life WW11, and how it affected the ordinary people in Germany. It was a very well written book and I had a hard time putting it down.
 A must read for "every" age.  I cried, I laughed, and I fell in love with each and every character.  Every word is delicious; that is the only way I can describe this most amazing book.  I felt, tasted, and breathed in every lovely page.  Thank you, Mr.  Zusak, for your timeless story.  You are truly a mighty wordsmith, my dear sir.
 A story written partly from the perspective of a child, but predominantly from that of a vague spector who collects the souls of the dead. It's a mesmerizing tale in the cold setting of WW II Munich, Germany.
 This is a story of.a girl in Nazi Germany who is part of hiding a Jew in the basement. It is a story of the love of her foster parents and the boy next door under the worst of circumstances. It is told in an unusual way with "death" being the narrator. It is compelling and emotional.
 Very engaging story that holds your interest until the end. Interesting concept having death as the narrator. As well as dealing with the plight of the Jews it also gives an insight into the lives of an ordinary German family under the Nazis. The main character Liesel developes through the book. Look forward to seeing the film.
 Hard to get concept of the writing style but soon realized Death was a narrator. Great love story, from many angles!
 Great book. Couldn't put it down. Balanced with happy / sad moments. Plan to read this again in the future.
 I really enjoyed this book. It is one of those rare books in which the characters (even death) are so vividly portrayed  that you feel you know them.  This tale of everyday life in an extraordinary time tells a terrible story in a very beautiful way .
 I have read several accounts of the holocaust, but none that developed a character with such effective use of language.
 At times slow, but deeply forgivable for the beauty of its prose and weight of its content.<br/>I recommend it.
 Narrative elements of human love compassion, horror, magical realism and history combine to make a readable novel that has one thinking in several dimensions.
 I have read many books about Germany and WWII, Very few have portrayed Germans and Jews as so fully human as does this.
 I could not put this book down. So beautifully written and<br/>Evokes so many emotions. I will most definitely read more from this author.
 Fascinating study of world war two through the eyes of a child. Her journey from childhood to womanhood is marker with so many memorable characters. I haven't read a book that engrossed me so much since The Thornbirds.
 Besides giving an insight to the people of Germany during the  war,this book gives a look at words and how they can be used to develop powerful imagery in a story. An excellent read.
 Excellent journey. The story teller alludes at first.  That or the want of him being someone other than who he is.  A story told in second person is the most clever way that this journey takes you by the hand and gently walks beside you.
 I had to get used to the writing style in the beginning but after I got used to it (which didn't take long) I couldn't stop turning the pages. It was amazing to just fall into the pages and see what Liesel was seeing and especially to feel what she was feeling. The author doesn't hide anything from the reader, he'll tell u what would happen in the upcoming pages right away but it's the how that's so incredibly beautiful about it.
 Articulate and brilliantly written.  One of the most amazing books I have read.
 Very few books make such an impression.  In my life there have been hundreds of books but only  a few I will always carry with me.  This book is one of those few.  To see history from the perspective of a character that lived it makes it more than an event.  The writing is haunting, from the perspective of death itself.  The characters are deep, complex and flawed in the truest ways.  Amazing
 A great read that shows the best in humanity. Having Death as the narrator is a great hook. The only criticism (VERY minor) is the author at times too hard, is too obvious, in his desire to always tie color to condition.
 How can it be those things? It just is, what a cool concept for a book.  The author is truly creative and brings such hope from a book surrounded and narrated by death
 Markus Zusak transports you into the war-torn world of a young girl named Liesel. The story is dark. (It takes place in Germany during WWII and is narrated by Death.) However, Zusak's imagery and character development keep you engaged and thirsty for what comes next. It makes you laugh, cry, writhe in anger, and gasp in horror. It is pure brilliance!
 This book was well written and I couldn't put it down.  I immediately wanted to see the movie after I read the book.
 I loved "The Book Thief" by Markus Zusak.  The story is tastefully told through the angel of death and even<br/>though it sounds spooky and alarming thinking of a death angel, it is so tastefully narrated that I thought it was<br/>a "kind and fascinating" story.  I hIghly recommend this book!
 One of the few books that can bring on both tears and laughter. Deeply human and refreshing. Takes awhile to get into. Short chapters make it easy to take up and put down. One of my best reads of the year. Read it b/4 seeing the movie. Movie is much better then the critics gave it credit for.
 Moving, gripping story.<br/>A story that will stay with me for a long time.<br/>Characters were nicely developed.<br/>Would have enjoyed reading more in the epilogue.<br/>Recommend for readers 15 and older.
 Some of the most endearing characters I've ever "experienced" in a book. This book may ever remain on my top ten list.
 Fantastic.  Horrific. beautiful. Ugly. Painful. Refreshing. Haunting.  Enlightening. Smiling. Grieving. Disbelief. Satisfaction. Historical. Nightmares.  Support. Prejudice. Hatred. And pure love.
 As I started to read this book I quickly realized that much of it was based on fact or experience.  It reminded me how important books are even in today's society.
 So different to have a sympathetic and empathetic Angel of Death as the narrator of the story. A rare look at the plight of innocent Germans during the Nazi reign of terror.
 I love this book~reading it before watching the movie is very insightful and MOVING.  The author does a great job of giving a very different perspective on a german child in World War II.  I throughly enjoyed reading it for a second time.
 I don't even want to see the movie, the book was so good! Beautiful story for the time period. I will read it again!
 Very interesting book and now I want to see the movie.  All I can say is WOW!  I'm recommending it to our book club next year.
 A fast read. Couldn't put it down. Beautiful story that makes one really consider what daily life in Germany must have been like during the war. Fascinating and touching.
 I saw the movie and was inspired to read the book.  Mr. Zusak writes in a most unique and simplistic way that brings clarity to the story and touches the heart through it's wonderful characters.  He almost makes death seem like an old friend...almost.<br/>Highly recommend this one for people who want to understand how the ugliness of humanity can be overcome by it's beauty.
 I had to read this for my book report, and I was very pleased to choose this book. He did such a good job writing it, and it was a fun book to read.
 Honestly I almost never give any book five stars but this blew me away "an amazing masterpiece worth of significant recognition" is the best way to tell you how it is, to describe the story it's self is depressing beautiful and full of colour and never ceases to brush over anything it's a deep story that has touched my heart.
 I stumbled upon this book simply by exploring the amazon e-books top 100 lists and was, prior to this purchase, unfamiliar with the author.  I am so so so glad I purchased this book.  It was an absolutely wonderful, beautiful story and so well told.  I love the narration--it added a bit of a twist to the book.  It's definitely a bit sad but given the subject matter and time frame, fittingly so.  I believe it provides an interesting insight into this period of history.  I will definitely be purchasing this author's other books and recommending this one to my friends!
 I give it four as it was a little slow on starting but the ending was worth the slow start.  Great WWII fiction
 An all-time favorite.  This is the second time I have read it.  It was picked this year by both reading groups to which I belong.  I also saw the movie, which is also worth the time.
 this movie is a must see.
 Great read, clever approach in narration.
 Anyone could love this wonderful book I'll read this again and again and it will make me cry every time
 Confusing at first but than you get it. My daughter read it and loved it. She attends a school that reads all kinds of hard books.
 a sad, sad story of a small girl and her family who do the right thing during the Holocaust. and, though you know throughout the book there will likely not be a happy ending, the book is one you can't put down.
 This is one of the best books I've ever read. I couldn't put it down!<br/>I laughed and cried and still recall bits of the story.<br/>I am not going to see the movie because there is no way it can capture the brilliance of Zusak's words.
 I loved this book. I seriously couldn't put it down. I was unhappy when I had to stop reading and do other things. I would highly recommend this book.
 It's always a great book when you get so emotionally attached to the characters. It's basically based on the holocaust so you know it's a sad book but the way it was narrated was unique. If you read it, you won't be disappointed.
 Very moving and wonderfully written. The love of Liesel for Papa, Mama, and Rudy was deep and true. Her empathy for Max and friendship added so much to the story.
 This was  a great book.  After getting into it, I had a problem putting it down!  What a dismal period that must have been for the people of Germany who so suffered under Hitler.
 Great book
 I couldn't really get into this book. Interesting story but I just couldn't get into it.
 Beautifully written filled with compassion and love.
 A truly magnificent book that deals with a horrific time in world history, the holocaust...the format is unique and thought -provoking. An excellent read for a book club, and much better than the movie, which was good!
 This book is one of my favorite books ever, Must read !
 I loved the story of the book thief. It was horrendous and beautiful all at the same time. I too know the magic and importance of books so I loved this sad story.
 The book is well written and very unique.  From that perspective it was enjoyable to read. However the story is difficult, almost depressing and definitely sad. Just so you know.  It is not uplifting
 This book is for any age of reader YA to adult.<br/>The characters live on long after the book is done.
 Movie is hard hitting too. Worth the time to read!
 So well written with characters one can relate with in situations that are hard to fathom in a storyline that moves at a good pace.  Nicely done.
 Nothing will change your perspective of the world and of the war quite like this novel. A puddle of tears!
 The title says it all. I believe the movie received excellent ratings and the book is able to tell SOO much more about the characters' feelings and thoughts!  Such an incredible moving tale about a horrible time in history.
 Fantastic read, very hard to put it down and walk away! Would recommend for anyone who loves historical based fiction or just looking for something written from a new perspective.
 I ordered this book for a college course of mine and it arrived in very good condition.  My only complaint is that the book it's self wasn't sealed at all but I guess that's not too bad since it never got damaged to begin with.
 Very well written and easy to read. I haven't picked up another book to read since starting this and I'm almost finished. Very easy reading...interesting perspective on the part of the author. Enjoyed
 Excellent book.  Pretty close to a classic in my estimation.  Well written, believable characters a hopeful book for a hopeless period of time.,
 This story tells of the experience of Nazi Germany through the lives of the working folks.  It is well told and hard to put down.
 A superb, unique description of a young girl in Nazi Germany.  Colorful, and narrated in a most unusual manner.  An exquisite read.
 The Book Thief helped me see the tragedy of Hitler and the German people in a new light. For that I thank Markus Zusak.
 It's not just any book that is told from Death's point of view.  Not only is "The Book Thief" narrated by Death, but Death wins the reader over, as a sympathetic, even protagonistic (is that even a word?) character.  I don't want to give anything away, but I found this story to be heartbreaking,  hopeful, and a thing of beauty in a broken time and place.
 This gave me an eye-opening view of how it must have been to live in Germany during World War II.  The book is funny, sad and heart-wrenching in many places.  It made me thankful for how I am personally blessed.
 A very different approach to story telling. I was fascinated by it and found the various perspectives brought a complexity to the situations I would not have considered. I really great book.
 I thought this was well written, I couldn't put it down for long, it drew me into a time in history that was so devistating and void of acceptance of ones right to breath. The only thing is the ending! To me it was rushed and unfinished. No justice to the character's. D. Rea
 A very moving story of a young German girl during WWII.  Beautifully written characters.  Uniquely narrated by Death.  Highly recommended.
 I'm old enough to remember World War II as a grade school child and it's interesting to read about life on the other side.  We American children certainly had a much easier time than those under the thumb of Hitler.  Another book to read along the same theme is "Five Smooth Stones."
 I enjoyed the book--easy read--it has been a while since I read it--and I read it for relaxation--and that was fine. I actually do not remember details--  but the' book thief' herself kept me reading and I got into her character--ie-trying to understand her through the book. Sorry--I'm not a good reviewer--just read for pleasure and escape.
 This was a book<br/>The book thief<br/>Is one of the best book s that  I have ever read. I<br/><br/> that I couldn't, put down until I Finished it. A story that I couldn't stop reading.  This is the second time I have read it .  I might read it again. what a treasure.
 This a book that will stay with me for a long time.  So well written from the 3rd person perspective of death.  Could easily read this again
 Wonderful story!  I love it and the writing is superb, simple, and yet so very graphic.  It was an interesting read and the thought process of the writer is just wonderful to think about as it unfolds.
 Wasn't sure at first, but as the story developed, I found myself completely drawn in.  Found myself waking up thinking about it &amp; reading more in the middle of the night.  Can't wait for our book club discussion.
 The story was excellent.  The foster parents, particularly Rosa, turned out to be more and better than my first impression in the beginning.  Death's comments were confusing at first until I realized his part in the story. Great book!
 What a beautiful, heartbreaking story of life in war torn Germany.  Somehow we (or I anyway) think of all Germans as being sympathizers with Hitler and now I can see how wrong I was.  I would recommend it to strongly to anyone.
 My grandson is reading this book for the summer break. He has been enjoying the book and picked it himself.
 What a story....mesmerizing in the style of narration, heartbreaking, yet triumphant, like the human spirit, in the story.  One that left me pensive and a little dark in emotion.
 Zusak told the story in an unusual manner that strangely keeps one intrigued. The sorrow and pathos of Germany with the rise of Nazism was at times depressing but the author added touches of human dignity that helps one through the story. Good read.
 This book is a must read for ages 13 to 100.  The perspective of death as the narrator, and the innocence and bravery of Leisel, the main character, will leave lasting memories of joy in spite of the destruction in the small Nazi-German village.  The neighbor boy, Rudy, will burn a hole in your heart with his bravery and spirit...the characters will live on in your heart.  Read it and rejoice in the great human spirit that thrives where there is love.<br/><br/>I think of the images and events, and they fill my soul.  Enjoy, and be sure to watch the video of Markus Zusak giving a book talk in Australia.  The part he tells about his family, when they were painting houses, and it was time to break the eggs for lunch.  Well worth the google search.  (It illustrates Zusak's rich writing style and his sense of humor).
 Wonderful story of a German girl living in WWII war-torn Germany and her love of books.  Gives an insiders' view of Nazi Germany.
 The best book I have read in a long time.  I enjoyed the fact that the story was written in the third party( by death).  The book was very well written.  It was an amazing story.
 Highly recommend this book.  Captivating and powerful from beginning to end.  Could not put it down.  Looking forward to reading more from this author.
 Well written. Great book for any aged teen or adult. Pleasantly surprised by its complexity. Usually, I find the young adult genre predictable and rather simplistic. Not in this case. Highly recommend this book.
 A Well written good story that touches your heart.  The characters are well define and become endearing.  It provides another angle to the hardships of people during WWII.
 Well constructed story with believeable characters and situations set during an ugly time in history.
 This the best book I have ever read! So beautifully written. I love that the narrator is death, a very different perspective
 What an amazing book. How simple, how beautiful the story it tells. I saw the movie first. The book is so much more. Read it, whether you choose to see the movie or not.
 Thought provoking using Death as the narrator of this sad story ....I found the tale  compelling and inspiring.<br/> The best and worst of humankind eloquently detailed.
 This was a wonderful book about a spirited young girls survival through war yet it was light hearted surrounded by love. I can't wait to see if the movie is as good.
 Unlike the author, I have no words adequate to describe this book. From the surprising choice of narrator to the  almost poetic beauty of the writing, I could hardly put this book down. BRAVO!!
 Really enjoyed Death's perspective as the storyteller who describes day to day life in Germany during WWII.  Without becoming maudlin he tells about a brave girl and how she came of age. Will read more by this author.
 A great narration of a girl, her life and the meaning of words.<br/>Although initially the book started out slow for me, I became attached to the story when the relationship started with The Book Thief's foster parents, especially the father.  I am reminded of history and an unpleasant time of war.  This will be an interesting book to discuss at an initial book club gathering.
 I really enjoyed this book. I didn't want to put it down. My heart went out to these characters. Don't forget your tissue.
 I loved this book, awesome and needs to be shared with all your friends. Pass it on so everyone may enjoy this book
 I started this one at 9 AM and, with a short break for lunch finished it<br/>around 7 PM. Others with whom I've shared it agreed that it was very<br/>well written, strange and compelling.
 This was a great read that I could not put down. It took me awhile to get used to the author's writing style but I did. Anxious to see the movie now.
 I have never written a review for anything before. So that in itself should give a hint to how truly amazing this piece is.<br/>I loved every single word of this book. Markus Zusak drags you through every emotion a person can feel.<br/>It's a book that will make you stay up all night reading just because you can't stop. It's a book you will never want to end. This book is the definition of perfection and should be read by everyone.
 Great read!
 Even though I don't usually read WWII books, I read The Book Thief because it was highly recommend by my granddaughter. The unique perspective of death as the narrator keeps you hooked to the last word. This book is an excellent read for junior high students through adult.
 One of the best books I've ever read.  Arrived timly and in VG shape.  I was surprised to see it was considered a "young adult" book, which my young adult daughter is now reading and enjoying very much.
 I was engaged with this story and its characters from the first sentence to the last.  I have read this book seven times, so far, and plan to re-read it again and again.  For me, The Book Thief is a major literary accomplishment.
 The book thief is one of those books that you can't put down. It has a unique storyline as well, definitely recommend
 Beautifully written, smooth, lyrical, sad.  A time in history usually referred to in a savage and horrific way...yet this story is told from a different point of view. This story has humanity, compassion, love, and even humor. So good to know that in the midst of insane barbaric cruelty, there can still be love and hope.
 This book is much more than a "teen historical fiction reading selection." The characters are multifaceted and well developed. Zusak's descriptives are rich and create though provoking images. A little more could have been devoted to Liesel's later life and her last encounter with the narrator. Unusual choice of narrator but an excellent one that personifies who we all will inevitably face.
 This book has the heart and soul of an innocent child and the sophistication and wisdom of the most learned and accomplished Holocaust scholar.  This is by far the best book I read in 2013.  Thank you, Markus Zusak,  for this masterpiece!
 After seeing the movie by the same name I knew I had to read the book. I absolutely enjoyed every moment of it and I felt I had a face with the characters since I had seen the movie. The beginning is a little hard to get into until you understand who the narrator is.
 The Book Thief is a very sad story.  It is written in a creative way which is sometimes a little confusing.  All  in all, it is a good book.
 This book was a real "can't put it down" read.  I didn't want it to end.  I wanted to know what happened to every character, I wanted to stay a part of their lives.
 I enjoyed this book very much.  I thought the writing was excellent and I appreciated the courage of the characters.<br/>I recommend it to readers of all ages.
 This book is captivating from beginning to end.  I didn't want it to end! The historical references are spot on!
 I did not want to read this book because of the WWII setting and almost missed out on an amazing, unforgettable novel.<br/>So read it.  Marvelous book.
 It's a good book. Book clubs would enjoy it.
 The story was written in a style that held one's attention.  Was an interesting story line. The characters were well developed.
 I thought it was a fabulous story, kept me interested all the way thru! The main characters were so well received  , also narrated by death was quite effective in moving the story along, able to have us see so much of what was really happening in Germany and all around indirectly what was going to take place with all concerned! Does this make any sense? Any how I am going to see the movie, soon!
 the book held my interest by telling a sad story with humility and humor. I want to know more about the aftermath of diesels life during war - how do you recover from that?
 Such a wonderful book. It kept me wanting to know more what was going to happen next. The characters were so real to the time period. I would definitely recommend this book and it would be a good one for a book club to discuss.
 Great read. The fact that the story was narrated by death took a few chapters to get used to but really added to the story. I couldn't put it down.
 Very interesting look at the war from a civilian German point of view. Also an out look of the Jewish issue.  I liked it.
 A heart-warming book, in the strangest of ways.  Words can damn us and save us.  Recommend it to anyone with a beating heart.
 I simply could not put this book down once I started reading it.  The writing style truly made me feel like I was there living this story.  Great book, highly recommend it!
 human nature so beautiful and so terrible. we speak glibly of our dark side but this book makes real that darkness<br/>yet is hopeful.<br/>a truly profound book.
 Just to be clear, I have not watched the movie but after reading this book I don't know how they made it work as a movie.<br/><br/>One of the things that I love about the written word is the nuance that it can bring to a story. Not sure how the nuances in the book translate onto the big screen but I imagine it has hits and misses, because that was how I felt reading the story.<br/><br/>Hits and misses. Some of it worked for me as far as character/plot development etc. Some of it didn't. My brain found it challenging going back and forth with Death narrating. Death was very abstract in it's communication style.<br/><br/>My mother grew up during this time period,and I have heard her stories for decades, I found it interesting reading the story understanding the History that went with it.
 Probably the best book I have ever read.  While I hope Markus Zusak has written more, I feel that I must 'dwell on' this one for awhile.
 This was a touching and very intense novel about a young girl struggling to survive in Nazi Germany.  It describes the brutal, crushing, punishing atmosphere and the fear and helplessness of its many many victims.  Despite the depressing circumstances, the characters find things to celebrate and ways to be happy.
 I can see why this stayed forever on "best sellers" lists.  The girl was all of us at times.....and she stirred our very souls.  The element of truth regarding the war never wavers  Twas
 This book was very long, but had a very good story. I would recommend people to read this.
 I did. For too many years. The book is brilliant.  And yes, middle schoolers can read it as soon as they can access the concept and language.
 Though it took me a little while to fall in sync with the narrator, eventually he fell into a rhythm that I fell in love with. Such a unique perspective
 this book was by far one of the best stories I've read in a long time, wonderfully written,. it tells the story of growing up in Nazi Germany through the life of just one young girl. it made me laugh and cry, definitely would read this again and I plan on seeing the movie.
 I loved the book.  Short chapters made it perfect for reading when time was short.  It's also good to use with groups having an ongoing discussion of the book.
 Excellent, enthralling story.  I didn't want it to end.
 Excellent view of what happened to individuals and families on the 'other side' of the war. Beautifully written - unique style of writing. The movie is good, but not nearly as moving as the words on the page.
 I am left changed by this novel.  I had to put it down multiple times and give myself a moment to collect my feelings.  The words will climb under your skin and into your heart.
 I especially loved the unique style in which The Book Thief was written through the eyes of Death. I felt like I was right there in that uncertain and desperate historical period of time. This book is a keeper!
 Loved this book.  Loved how it was written in the third person, the narrator the angel of death.  Wasn't sure that I could read<br/>yet another good about German, as Hitler terrorized the world.  But as dark and depressing as the subject is, this book found the light in the darkness and depicted the life of a single girls struggle- her life growing up, struggles and nightmares of happenings all around her.  It is a must read.
 I loved this book but it was a harder read and definitely not a beach read. I did not like the end at all but overall it was pretty good.
 Liesel Meminger is a character who is very relatable, and who is surrounded by wonderful characters. The characters are complicated and dynamic, and often impress the narrator as well as the reader. All of this is done in an artistic and captivating style.
 I really enjoyed this book because I am also a book lover. I could not imagine living through a time when books were not allowed because they have been a huge part of my life my entire life! The Holocaust was a terrible time in history.
 Loved the book!!!! Had to watch the movie a couple of times, before I connected to it.  Instant connection to the characters in the book... loved the development of characters.
 I enjoyed this book, although a little slow a times and was somewhat disappoiinted in the ending.  None the less, I would recommend reading it.
 An amazing and haunting account of the horrors of the Holocaust. The author has a beautiful way with words, which makes the story unforgettable.
 I loved reading about Liesel about her ups &amp; downs and about her Papa &amp; Mama&amp; Rudy her interactions with them and her feelings for them . Also it is good to remind ourselves of how cruel this world &amp; life can be sometimes but even with all that there is joy.
 Very interesting book showing perspective of young girl living in Germany during WW11 and how she survived.
 And, again, five stars, the story, the telling, is beautiful and horrific.  I highly recommend this incredible tale of love, loss, hate, tragedy and survival.
 The author had the ability to tell you the outcome of certain events but still maintain a sense of mystery. You never knew for sure so he kept you reading to be sure of the actual ending of particular events.
 Death said it all.  Although he pitied the German people.  He says they had a chance.  The people in the camps had no chance of survival or very little.  That said, we forget that there were compassionate Germans during the war.  Zusak brings these people to our attention and makes us remember that all is not black and white.
 Described perfectly! Exactly what I expected. Once I saw the movie, I just had to have the book. This is one I expect to read again and again.
 Came quickly and in good condition as advertised. The book was for a gift. It is a great book to read with your teenage kids!
 Nazi Germany was a difficult environment for everyone. But for a small group of children it became their haven. How they grew and survived is what made the book special.
 I really enjoyed this book.  It started out a bit slow for me, but after max's character was introduced i couldnt put it down. This book is heart felt and well written.  It gives you a German child's perspective of Hitler's devastation, and demonstrates the ability of one person to continue on in the midsts of loss and utter chaos.  I would definately recommend this book.
 So beautifully written. A most unusual account of Germany through the eyes of death.
 What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? I loved it and found it hard to put down.
 Zusak coaxed my heart into his hands and crushed it with this beautiful, haunting, all-too-true story of humanity at its best and most tragic. I loved every excruciating minute of it.
 Impossible to put down. Quick reading. A different perspective on the rule of the Third Reich and the impact it had on people.
 An awesome story that details the wrongs of Nazi Germany through the eyes of a young girl as seen by the narrator, Death.
 A really good book that takes some time getting through the mundane to get to the interesting.
 I saw the movie and then read the book.  Eventhough it's about a tragic time in our history, it is so well written and truly a treasure.  I loved it.
 This is such an amazing and depressing book. I recommend this to EVERYONE!!!! If at first the book loses your interest just keep reading!!!!! Trust me its worth it!!!!!!! This is truly an amazing book. I honestly just don't know how to explain how unbelievably incredible this book is.
 This offers a very different perspective of Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. It is very unique in that it is about a young girl told from the perspective of death, who narrates the book. It is very heartwarming and it will make you laugh and cry. Read it!
 I loved the movie which I saw before reading the book.  Enjoyed the book. My father was born in Germany and would have lived in the same kind of town as in the book, so I felt personally attached to this story .  Loved the characters and cried when I saw the movie and at the end of book.
 Engrossing story with fascinating realized characters. Learned more about WWII from this than any history class.
 I really like this book, this book was enjoy full to read. In the future I will read it again. Good book.
 The writing in this book is astounding.  I seldom am moved to tears by a book but I was by this one.  Wonderful
 A slow start as I got the feel of the author's approach - color plays a huge role in this book - but after a few chapters, I was hooked!
 this is a book written iN a very creative way.  The characters, the narrator, the circumstances and the historical context, as well as the titles and descriptions of the books used in support of the title and narrative, are developed conscientiously and with care.  this is an author who deserves thoughtful careful readers and the book a second and perhaps even a third reading. BRAVO!
 the imagery and metaphors are just amazing. This book gave me goosebumps so many times. Just beautifully written.
 I loved this story...while sad, there was hope in it.  Different from many other holocaust novels, yet still very gripping.
 I saw the movie and just had to get the book!  Books are always better than the movie (more detail), I will picture the characters as they are in the movie because they were perfect for their parts.<br/><br/>I just LOVE The Book Thief and would recommend it for your reading pleasure.<br/><br/>Great Job Markus Zusak
 engaging story, a little confused at the beginning figuring out who the narrator was.  I gave it 4 stars because I did find parts of the novel confusing.  But overall I enjoyed the book
 At first I found that the book was a little boring but as you keep reading it it captivates you. It's a beautiful and touching narrative taking place in of of the darkest periods of our history. A beautiful book.
 my son is reading this for school...good book. The whole family has watched the movie.
 A most beautifully written novel carrying a most delicate story of some most lovable people, and some most despised ones.
 Engaging unique style.  The most rewarding aspect of this book is an 'inside' view of Germany during WWII.<br/>This author is going places...
 It was a gift and the person I gave it hasn't said there were any problems
 We watched the movie but it does not do justice to the book. Almost finished with the book and it is on the list of my top 50 books. Please read it.
 I like how it's told by death it really gives you a great point of view but I didn't like how you killed off Rudy I really was getting to know him and like him
 The story is told from the grim, yet interesting, perspective of Death. The writing style was one I hadn't really experienced yet and I enjoyed it. It was refreshing to be reading such a creatively told story. Not the same old format many novels follow.<br/><br/>I fell in love with the characters. The author does a fantastic job describing the smallest, but only the most important details about them.
 Fine writing. I felt there were times when I walked with Leisel<br/>and Rudy .i heard Papas accordian. Not every author cando that
 Sad, but hopeful too.  Great read.
 I enjoy WW2 time period but this was a very unique approach. The story is true and amazing. This book is good for older students as well as adults.
 The words created a story of stark beauty and horrible cruelness and devastation. The story is both sweet and sad and I think that confounding dichotomy was the author's intention. So very much like life but drawn from such a desperate time and location in history.
 I loved this book, which shows the incredible cruelty and heartfelt compassion humans are capable of.  A truly sad yet hopeful and uplifting story, but has a haunting, unsatisfying ending.
 more revealing than the movie; could not put the book down; well written, a must read in the high schools;
 Very, very good book. Everyone should read it!  I've never read a book twice ... but this one may be an exception.  I'm anxiously looking forward to seeing the movie!
 So far so good. I'm reading this for a study group. We only meet once a month and have just read the first one hundred pages.
 This book was a super read. It brought home how difficult it was for those Germans who did not support Hitler to survive. They had their families to think about.
 Don't let the young adult label keep anyone from reading this wonderfully written, imaginative, and compelling book that brings Nazi Germy alive.  Making Death the narrator puts an entirely different slant to any book on the war.  The characters are believable, the history is accurate, and the writing is clear and to the point yet descriptive and beautiful in places and chilling in others.
 What a beautifully written story of humanity. This one will haunt my dreams for awhile. I will forever be glad I took the time to read it.
 Wow! Loved this book! So beautifully written! I didn't want it to end! I can't imagine how they've made a movie out of it. The words are what make this book!
 I have never read a book where I have fallen so in love with the characters, I was enthralled in their stories until the very end. I have also never had a book make me cry, until The Book Thief. I could honestly read this book another 50 times and never grow tired of the words. If I could I would give it so many more stars than 5. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a beautifully written and captivating story of love, war, and the beauty of humans and all of their faults.
 This book is well written, as seen through the eyes of the grim reaper. He follows a young girl through innocence, death, war and love.
 On the whole a very good description of the war time in Germany.  A bit dragged out and at times not very well defined.
 was interesting the writing did not go on and on in repetition as in some books. The storyline was very good the way it was told was novel and done well exciting and held your interest the way a good mystery would.
 A unique book.  Very special, and maybe not for the action oriented.  Beautifully done.  Will be read for many years.
 Read the book before seeing the movie.  Loved the book!
 I thoroughly  enjoyed this book.  It also made me appreciate how blessed I am to have been born in America.  Even though at my age, I lived through this period in history, my life was nothing compared to those in Germany and other European countries.  I have met people who live where I do now who were in concentrations camps during the war.  What a horrible existence.
 This book was so much better than the movie although I always enjoy watching the performance of Geoffory Rush.
 You will embrace his writing style first; this is a unique book that will/is a classic. Not ever ordinary nor hard... just right.<br/><br/>Les
 Historical novels are my favorite types of books to read. This was a very uniquely written book, with the personification of "death" as the narrator of the story. The heroine is a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany during WWII. This is definitely a case of where the book is *way* better than the movie.
 I was fascinated from beginning to end. It was so unique to have the narrator be death, yet it was not morbid.  I loved the characters and the author did a great job in developing multiple characters.  It was a terrible time to be alive and yet there was so much love and hope.
 This book was recommended to me &amp; I'm not sorry I bought it. It's an excellent read, unusual &amp; very insightful. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie when it comes out
 This author takes you into the story with him He has a brilliant ability to make a story so absolute, so real, that you find yourself inside the story with the characters.
 The book was fantastic.  I didn't order the movie, but saw it in a theater.  The movie is also very well done.
 Compelling and heartbreaking story...
 I think that it was a good read. Told from an unusual perspective. Great book for my book club, much conversation
 A heart rending story about a little girls' experience in the War and how she grew to love books.
 I read this for book club and truly enjoyed the story as well as all of the characters.  What I liked most is the detailing in the history of that time during WWII.
 This book broke my heart and filled it all at the same time. I can't say enough good things about The Book Thief and it's painful and inspiring look into Nazi Germany.
 Just finished this book. I ordered it after seeing a preview of the movie coming out. I am glad that I did. The story was so well written and I really enjoyed it.
 Lot's of twists and turns, read slowly due to all the tears. A look of what it may have been like for the poor german during the war.<br/>A review of what it was like for all jews. We are such complex creatures.
 A decent read. Heartfelt. It is a book that really makes you think about the moments in life where we should act upon our feelings and say what we need to say
 This book held my interest and it was interesting to see the lives of the children; how they dealt with the stresses and trauma of war and lack of supplies. The relationships were well developed and it gave me the opportunity to envision the circumstances.
 Beautiful!  I hated for it to end.  The author has a brilliant way with words and gives a different perspective of WWII than anything I've ever read.
 I decided to read this book before I saw the movie.  Started out a little slow but found .myself not wanting to put it down.
 I usually like to read the book before I watch the movie.  If the movie is half as good as the book I'll be satisfied.
 Nice book covering things they refuse to teach you about in school.
 So good that I saw it twice and now have added the book to my Kindle and as soon as I finish what I am reading, I will read this.
 I had to think for a couple of days before writing this review as it took awhile to sort out my feelings. I hesitated to be too negative since this book is beloved by so many including my cousins The book is well written and the characters are drawn well.  I have to admit that going in the synopsis left me wary as it seemed like a mash-up of several novels I have read in the past: Diary of Ann Frank, Shindlers List etc.  Since this book is aimed at Young Adults,it probably would have more meaning and application for them; however,it did not seem overly derivative. I did not like the affectation of the narrator being death.  It seemed gimmicky to me and set the expectation that death was what this novel was about. In the end rather than feeling grief I felt manipulated
 This book has given me a different slant on what WW2 was like from the view of a German.  We can't comprehend the situation for regular people during this time.  I am more sympathetic toward the every-day Germans now that I have read this book
 An amazing story, but a little hard to get into at the beginning. Stick out the first couple of chapters and you won't be able to put it down.
 As much as we try not to think about what people were going through during the holocaust, it is always heartening to hear stories of people who tried to help.
 This was engaging and exciting. Hitler's Germany from the point of view of a child. It is a page-turner for sure.
 I have never read a book like this before! It stayed with me day and night and I couldn't wait to get back to it everyday!  One of the best books I have ever read!!!!
 The book is quite a good read - but left me a little wanting at times in the dialog or the perspective or the depth or something.  I just can't put my finger on what the missing element was.
 I just finished the Book Thief today and LOVED it! Now I can't wait to see the movie. The writing was fantastic-I loved the way the cahpters were written with an overview at the beginning. The characters lured you into their lives-I felt connected to all of them. This book was a reccomendation from a friend and I'm glad I listened!
 I could not put this book down.  It is the most fascinating read!  I highly recommend reading The Book Thief!
 I enjoyed it throughly and have suggested it to all my friends, many of which had already read it...and agreed
 Loved it, the history was magical in my mind and the characters come to life. The author really shined a light on the pain the Germans suffered at Hitlers hands. The Germans were not all his minions and it felt good to see the human spirit of love in the message and not just the mess Hitler had dealt.
 Well written.  A view of Germany during WW11 I had never thought about. A book of ordinary Germans, some who saw Hitler and Nazism for the evil  they really were.
 This historical tragedy is told in such a personal way it tears your heart out. So much love and tenderness keeps you attached to the lead characters. We need more people like Papa and the book thief.
 It took me a while to come to terms with the writing style of Markus Zusak but would encourage you to press on. This book is beautifully written by one who loves words. In addition to the narrative, the story also gives you an insight into the hardships of war for the German people.  I loved it and like to think that Death will come and fetch me with so much tenderness one day.  Jenny Gill - South Africa
 Insight into people living through unspeakable horror and surviving. I could not look away nor could i imagine facing a new day to repeat seeing unending pain delivered to innocents.
 This book is a work of literature.  It is a novel and poetry in one great story.  I love historical fiction and I loved this.  It was written from a neat point of view.
 Really enjoyed this story. The author is a very good storyteller. The was kept my interest and was very enjoyable
 This book was absolutely amazing! I recommend it to those interested. It is a beautifully tragic and heartwarming at the same time.
 I loved this book.  I was reading it with my daughter for school and I finished before she did.  It was heartbreaking but triumphant as well.  Fast shipment from seller.
 I wanted this story to go on forever! I felt as if I have lived in the era this book was written in! I cried, I laughed, I became angry! GREAT book!
 Interesting and well written book with insights of conditions during this time in history.  The children exhibit bravery and perseverance in the face of adversity and heartache, while still maintaining the wonder and orneriness of youth.
 This was a book needed for my daughter for a School reading project. She liked the book and was glad that she read it.
 Amazing, difficult to begin but didn't  know quote what  to expect.  Amazing story, author did not try to "pretty" up the story, felt real.  Excellent!
 This book was not easy to read but I found myself very attached to many of the characters by the end.  I am curious to see if the movie based on this book looks the same as the gray and ugly images that were formed in my mind during its darkest moments.
 Very interesting approach on narrator—enjoyed! The characters and story also very interesting on multiple levels—their personalities, challenges during the difficult, historic times.
 This was one of the most interesting and heartfelt books that I ever read with emotions that ranged from sheer pain to pure love. Great read.
 Really wonderful. It's a beautiful story. The viewpoint of the narrator and his reaction to what he sees is very unique.
 A truly beautiful and remarkable read - it should be on every required reading list.  Even though I give the highest rating offered, five stars still seems grossly inadequate for this powerful and touching story.
 There are few books that I can't stop reading and this is one. I wanted to read it again as soon as I finished. The beginning is strange but once you settle into the writer's style...it's magical.
 Beautiful story. But the writing will blow you away.  Incredible use of language and images. One of the best books I have ever read.
 Rarely do I find a book that haunts me as this one has. I want to love it, but something inside me says it wouldn't be appropriate. I want to hate it, but that same something battles with the other side of me, pushing and shoving until the room turns inside out and I have to close my eyes.<br/><br/>I'm still processing. I'm still reeling. I'm still...still. Quietly rolling the words around in my head. And I know I will for a very long time.<br/><br/>Rare. Haunting. Gorgeous. Ugly.  This book has it all. I'm so glad it's fiction...but we know better, don't we?<br/><br/>Kudos Markus Zusak. Kudos.
 This was a hard book to put down. The physical and emotional consequences of war are well portrayed. It makes me think of how easily we as humans can be drawn into unthinkable mob mentality.
 Wonderful book.  I rarely read anything from the Nazi point of view, this one was.
 I enjoyed reading this book. Good story line and well thought out characters. I hope the movie is half as good.
 I didn't think I was going to keep reading this book but it hooked me in,  I love the way the author described things I could actually see them in my mind.  Kudos to the author.
 When I read the other reviews and seen that Death was telling the story, I was worried that the book would be overly morbid. I was so wrong. This book is a wonderful combination of hope, love and sadness. Seeing things through Death's eyes gives you a new appreciation of the lives us humans live. You will not regret buying this book, it will be one that you read more than one time, finding a new revelation every time.
 My 9th grader had this assigned for SUmmer reading prior to her freshman year in High School.  As soon as she finished the book, it went throughout the entire family.  Amazingly well written.  What a fantastic book it is.  Funny in the first, despite the plot being one of the most difficult to write about in human history.  Almost every relative now has a copy of this book from us.  It is that good.  Buy it right now.
 I lost my original copy of the book, and I was so glad to find one that did not have the movie cover!
 not quite what i expected but interesting and readable.  The author is quite clever in that he leaves lots to your imagination and doesn't have to go into difficult explanations.
 The book is long but we'll worth the time the book thief is one of the best books I've ever read it's the best book I've ever read in my life word cannot explain how amazing this book really is and I'm only 11 I LOVE THIS BOOK 💖💖
 Incredible book, from the perspective of the Soul Collector. Brilliantly written. Never saw the movie. Don't need to.
 A very well written book. I love WWII books but this one was definitely different. Death as a narrator is very interesting. Heartbreaking yet beautiful. A must read...
 I did enjoy the Book Thief, very much. It was very well written, very sad, and I did have a good cry.<br/>I would have loved to know more of her life, how she ended up in Australia, who she married, and what happened to Max after she saw him again after the war. A great reason for a second book.<br/><br/>It's a book that really made you think, and hope that something like this never happens again.
 I would give it 10 stars if I could!  I just bought another of Zusaks' books and cannot wait to start reading it.
 This book will have you smiling one moment and then crying the next.  The writing style is so different and powerful from other books I have read.
 A little hard to get into because of the point of view with which the book was written, but the story is compelling, and in the end, well worth it.
 It took a few chapters for me to get use to the writing style, but once I did, I couldn't put it down. An excellent read and I was sorry to see it end.
 Having "death" as narrator was disturbing, but interesting.  The characters were all very real, and the author made every day incidence believable, as one sees war in real life experiences.
 How wonderful, how sad, how funny, how horrible and splendid. The writing is by far more than a film will ever extract. I could not put this book down.
 This was one of the best books I've read in a long while.  Well written, good character construction, touching story.
 What a fantastic read. I couldn't put it down. I love the characters in this book like they were a part of my own family. Totally recommend it to anyone that loves a great story during WWII.
 This book was amazing, but it is depressing. It is placed in World War II Germany. The imagery is wonderfully grim and really makes you feel like you are there.
 An interesting concept-death from death's perspective! The author does a good job of illustrating the inconsistency of we humans.
 A very good experience, will order from them again.
 A wonderfully written read! The format and point of view were intriguing. I have recommended this novel to all my friends. This is one of those books you want to keep going and not end.
 Great book!!!<br/>Can't wait to watch the movie!!<br/>Another one of my book club picks. Glad it was chosen.<br/>Would highly recommend it!
 Loved the way the author told this story. Especially the narrator.  It was a new approach to a time in history that was so sad.  Can't wait to see the movie.
 Great WWII story without the graphic violence. Its a story of relationships and how they shape us. It was endearing, and captivating. Liked reading it.
 Good book for young people-unsual narrative techniques
 Exceptional story, excellent writing.  It's a great bonus being provided with video segments pertinent to chapters being read.  Difficult to put the book down.
 I enjoyed this book because it was different. It was interesting to read from a young person's mind her life. I understand there is a movie of this book that I will try and see when it is available to me.
 Bought as a gift and my 13 year old said it's one of his favorite books!
 Death is the narrator of The Book Thief, and frankly, the author's writing style takes some getting used to. But the book is a glorious read. I recommend it highly.
 I read the book because I had missed the movie screenings in my locality.  The book was well written and kept my interest so much that I didn't want to put it down.
 This book was fantastic.  The feelings and horrors of the Germans who were not necessarily Nazis really came out.  The hardships on all of them was unbelievable.  The author makes you empathetic to all the characters.  How difficult for them to carry on their every day lives throughout that horrible time.  Loved every page!
 I have likely highlighted about half the passages in this book. Between the writing style and the heartwarming/wrenching story, I couldn't put it down. I believe that a good book is one that changes you a little bit when you read it, becomes a part of you. In my opinion, this is one such story.<br/><br/>To paraphrase the author, words have power. The words contained in this book are certainly powerful.
 The story is great. The writing is superior. His writing is so descriptive you see the action, smell the surrounding,feel<br/>the emotions of the cast. A most read.
 This is not an uplifting story superficially but it is reality.  It is a reminder of how strong the human spirit can be when there are no other choices.
 This book is a very slow read.  I really did not like it until 1/4 of the way through.  I am very glad I read this one.
 This book held my interest throughout its pages.  At first it was a challenge to look at the events through the eyes of the angel of death, but it was appropriate considering the subject material.  From my perspective in Australia, it showed how Europeans and Jews suffered in war.
 This is a beautifully written and moving book. Would definitely recommended to anybody looking for a great read. A+ +
 Most unusual writer but captivating once you get into the book.  The writer reveals through his character the wide spectrum of human emotions....from deep,  compassionate sacrificial  love to the reality of the brutal hatred and violence experience by the Jews from the Nazis.We should take notice of how the average German was duped by Hitler and let it be a warning to all free nations. I loved the book and will read it again.
 I knew the "secret" before I started reading this book, which surprisingly made it more enjoyable. The story was thought-provoking and a page-turner. It's easy to fall in love with the main characters.
 This book just grabs you and you have to keep reading.  I will have to get more books by this author.
 Good book...about a little girl swiping a book as they were all being burnt.
 THE STORY IS VERY REALISTIC IN LIGHT OF THE TIMES IN WHICH IT WAS WRITTEN. READING IT PUT ME INTO<br/>THE ACTUAL SCENE THE AUTHOR IMAGINED. BOOKS ARE ALWAYS BETTER THAN THE FILMS. THANK YOU! REGINA
 Our book club read this and overwhelmingly loved it. The author has a wonderful way of writing with great descriptive words that enabled you to picture exactly what he was saying. The story is very powerful as are most of the stories about that period of time. Highly recommend this book.
 This was the best book I have read in awhile...there are some books that stay with you in a haunting way...was sad to have finished it...wanted more..Will definitely read again!
 A book worth reading.  The detail and descriptions of characters was such  I felt I knew the them.  Brought to life the reality of that terrible period in in history and how people suffered.  Because of the book, I saw the movie which I thought did a good job of following the story.
 I loved this book.  It took me a few pages to get into it and figure out what was going on, but then after that I was hooked.  I love that it was narrated by "Death".  It was interesting to hear about life during Nazi Germany told from the average German citizen's perspective.
 I really enjoyed this story.  It is well worth the time one should take to enjoy it. Germany Hitler Jews and a child's perspectives .
 This is a great read.  I finished it in one day.  It's an emotional roller coaster to say the least.  The author does a great job putting you in the environment, to be connected with the characters.
 I would definitely recommend this book.  The style of writing was superb.  Couldn't wait to finish the story then was disappointed when I did.  Very touching.
 Thoroughly engaging right from the beginning.  Filled in a lot that the movie didn't include.  It brings more sensitivity regarding WWII.
 The movie was good, the book is fantastic and I know I will read it more than once. I love the use of death as a character.
 This is a fabulous book and enjoyed it. Came on time and was in good condition. This is a great reading club book.
 I loved the Book Thief.  I had seen the movie and was so glad I read the book.  I missed so much in the movie.
 This was a very beautifully written book.  Very sad, however, a story that had to be told.
 It was hard to get into...the first few chapters were awkward and confusing. But I just kept going and pretty soon things started to fall into place. A beautiful story foe sure. Just wish I had kept a box of Kleenex handy.
 Liesel was the conscience of Germany; she is brave and brash; she is a survivor.  Creating 'death' as the narrator is genius.  I learned more about the people of Germany--not all were Nazis--not all supported Hitler.  It enhanced my knowledge of WWII.
 I had read this book and love it earlier, but after seeing the movie, I decided to read it again and am glad I did.  Somehow it was richer the second time around.  The ending was more satisfying than the movie.
 The Book Thief is a simple book that holds onto you long after you have finished it.  The narrator is death.  When you think of death as the narrator there is a tendency to think of gloom.  In many ways Nazi Germany is gloom but the protagonist, Liesel, gives you hope for a world that can be better.  Liesel  who reminds you of the travails of Jonah impresses you with her ability to survive.
 This is a sad story, but it pulls you in. Makes you think about what many people had to go through durning the war.
 An interesting writing style and interesting historical subject matter. The period of which this book was written is of particular interest to me, so perhaps why I found it so enjoyable.
 Very much enjoyed reading this book.<br/>While world war two has many books written I quite enjpyed the prespecive preseneted by Mr. Zusal and the characters he developed
 A very well written book from an unusual perspective.  The story of survival, friends, love, and  knowing what you have as well as what you do not.
 Loved the book. But, found myself ill at east listening to death describe this black part of history until I got into the book . Then I couldn't put it down. Well worth it. Thank you Markus Zusak. My father was involved in the Liberation of Buchenwald Concentration camp and his photos finally came alive.
 A tender story of love and family. In the center of a horrific time of humanity, Nazi Germany, lives a neighborhood with real people. You suffer with the characters as they deal with the realities of oppression, survival and personal tragedy. The very ordinary moments will make you smile and laugh and feel a personal connection to the residents of Himmel Street.
 Great book.  Read it aloud to my 9 &amp; 11 year old boys, opening up great conversations about history and moral issues and choices that are made.  Highly recommend it.
 I loved this book it took a little while to get in to it but once i started to enjoy it i could not put it down highly recommend this book
 This book is expertly narrated by a very unlikely character.  Zusak has taken a horrific story of the holocaust and brought out beautiful but sad parts of it and how individual German lives were affected.  You don't always hear things about the German perspective except that Hitler was their leader.  He has shown that the German people also suffered greatly in the war in ways we often overlook.  Outstanding read!!
 This was so good and pulled you into their lives so completely it was hard for me to let go of it so that I could start another book.  Very moving and humorous at the same time. Loved it!
 Extremely well written. A story of survival &amp; love. Interestingly written from the character of death. It was hard not to like the main characters. Can't wait to see the movie.
 I loves reading this book. It was very good. Didn't put it down until I was done. Gave it to my mom and she read it just as fast and loved it. Really good book.
 A very enjoyable read! Well developed characters. An unusual perspective on a very trying time in World History. It inspires hope and compassion in readers!
 Worth more than it should
 This is an amazing book but painful to read. My family were Holocaust survivors and the depiction of Nazi germany is so pointed. While it is a redemptive story and an excellent book, reader be warned, tears will fall.
 It took some time to get interested in the characters.  But, as I got further into the book I was pulled into the WWII life.
 This is an amazing book, it had me bawling by the end and I recommend it to anyone who can handle heavy emotion
 Good Book.  I loved the different way of telling the story. I'm rather tired of WWII stories, so this was a fresh way of looking at it.
 Excellent,excellent story.Mr.Zusak sure knows how to tell a story.I could'nt find one thing I did'nt like about this book.Great story and great writing.
 As an English teacher I am privy to many books but I never got around to teaching this one.  A student recommended it and I have to say that it is a great read.
 this book arrived fast and in perfect shape. I'm a slow reader, but read thru this book so fast! I could not put it down! The movie was excellent as well!!
 Much larger book than expected.. But in a good way.
 This is one of the best books I've ever read. I walked in thinking,just another book,and came away with a new perspective on life and on death.What if we truly haunt him?
 Brilliant, beautiful book. I don't want to give anything away. Just go read it for yourself. I'm very glad I read it before seeing the movie (I'll have to wait for the DVD)
 The book is essentially all dialog, beautifully read by the narrator. It is a book well thought out, each character is well defined and it all comes together on the last disk. I recommend this for a person who has the patience and fortitude to stick with it. It is a well written novel, full of wisdom and passion.
 I really enjoyed reading this book.  The story just drew me in, and I hated to put it down.  It's a touching story of how important love is when times are difficult.
 Very well written, with characters that are completely believable, but very dark, which is, of course, completely in<br/>keeping with the story.
 I chose this rating because I truly believe that this book communicates a powerful message to us all. The message of  how powerful words can be. Words can manipulate a nation, they can control people's minds and hearts. Words can heal, destroy, create peace and produce annihilation. Words can die and words can survive. I would recommend this book to everyone. I am not sure everyone would understand it but they need to read it all the same.
 Love the way it was written... Unique.  I could feel the goodness and bad of humans painted on the pages....<br/>Fell in love with the characters.<br/>Awesome book!!!
 After seeing the preview of the movie, "The Book Thief", I became curious about the book. I thought I'd like to see the movie but wanted to read the book first. I'm so glad I did, but now I'm afraid the movie will be disappointing compared to the book.
 Intensely sad.  Very interesting point of view.  I didn't like it at first, but I grew to like it.  I loved the focus on Leisel and her character development.  Loved her relationship with Hans.  I liked this glimpse into how WWII affected the civilian Germans as I am more widely read on the Jewish perspective.  Great imagery.  I loved her relationship with word and how that motif continued throughout the story.
 I saw that this was going to be a movie and when I see that I like to read the book first!  I love books about WWII and this caught my attention...took awhile to get into it but when I did, I couldn't put it down!
 This is an excellent product. Its well made and works very well for what it was made for. We would def buy this product again if needed.
 Despite an unusual writing style, this is an interesting book about life in a small and very poor German town during WW2. I liked story but so very hard.
 Lots of books written about this era but this one is exceptional! A must read. Will be a classic someday like The Diary of Anne Frank.
 I very much enjoyed The Book Thief by Markus Zusak.  It did take me a few chapters to "get into" the book.  The writing style is very interesting and took a while to get used to, but once I got going, it was hard to put The Book Thief down.  Good story -  I cared about the characters and the ending was satisfying.
 First time for this author.  The title caught my attention.  The telling of the story is very different and very well done.  I enjoyed the book.
 An engaging story that discusses WWII issues from a more unusual perspective - the German people who were swept up in the war and how they suffered and survived.
 The story of the book thief was riveting.  I constantly wanted to know what was next but also feared what was next.  A great combination of true heart wrenching history and storytelling.
 This was a very interesting and different book  and really enjoyed reading this book. I would recommend this book as agreat book to read on a rainy day.
 Words can not adequately represent what I felt after finishing this book. I cried. I knew what was coming and I could not stop myself. This book wringed me of emotion and left me feeling emotionally drained. That is the only way I can explain it. Markus Zusak has done a brilliant job with The Book Thief. The writing style, the descriptive language... It's brilliant. Heavily recommeded.
 I enjoyed the writing.  An easy and fast read.  Easy to pick up where you left off.  Such a lovely different slant on this horrific time in our history.  Heart warming, yet informative.<br/>It keeps creeping into my mind.  Now I am ready to see the movie.  The book will fill in all the blanks.  Just lovely.  I encourage all to read this.
 This was a tragic but beautifully written book. The beginning was just slightly unusual but I was assured by those who had read it that it was excellent and they were right
 I read the book first and even though I enjoyed the movie, of course it can't be exactly like the book it was pretty close. But I enjoyed reading it and was surprized to see it come out in movie form.
 Fantastic book and a good buy.  Arrived in almost perfect condition.
 It stole my heart. I loved every word of this book. All I can say is WOW!  Get it read it and you will love it to. I can't watch these movie because there is no way they could capture  the feeling or essence if the word as Markus Susan has shared with us in his writing.
 A different type of story about a young girl alone at the begining of WW2 in Germany. How she survives and what life was like during that time. The author has done a good job in describing the characters in the book. Anyone who lived through this historic period probably knows about the war and the battles but little about how people survived on the home fronts. The book held my interest but I am not sure I liked how the book ended.
 Fantastic.  Emotional...never cried so hard over a story. Well done.... nice to read the effect on the other side of this tragic  event in history.
 Just as descrived
 There are a few books that make me want to sit quietly and think.  This is one of them.
 Excellent story, illustrates the best and worst of humanity.  Great characters - sad to realize in 2015, all of humanity does not appreciate that EVERY life matters.  Period.
 I already wrote a report on this and as I said I loved it.  I also loaned the book to my nephew and he loved it too.<br/>J. Spencer
 Daughter really loved the book.
 A wonderful story about the Nazi invasion of neighborhoods and other lands during the pre War build up as well as during the War itself in the 1940's.  This seems to be an Anne Frank type story, but with all avenues of the terror and tortures during this time period.  The reader will not be able to put this book down!
 This is a great book. I usually try to read the books before I see the movie, but this was not the case with The Book Thief. I still really enjoyed it. I totally give it 5 stars.
 Such a touching story about the horrors of natzi Germany.  Can't wait to see the movie!  The amazing details in the characters makes them so real.
 When I first started reading The Book Thief, I wasn't sure I liked the style of writing or layout of the pages at all. I always like to give a book a chance though and just a few pages in, I was hooked.<br/>By the end of this phenomenal story, I was weeping and quite emotional at the thought of the book ending. I couldn't recommend this read enough.
 This book was riveting! It was not uplifting, but yet it was  hopeful. It was so well written that you could imagine yourself with the narrator.  Towards the end of the book I could not put it down. Would highly recommend.
 My I pad is too old for the enhancement. As  a former teacher, I suggest that all High School students read this book@!
 Little slow getting into but author hooks you so you don't want to stop reading it! Turned out to be an excellent read!
 Very well written.  Good tale about Nazi occupied Germany.  Great reading about the importance of books and their ability to give hope under all circumstances.
 Unlike any other book! All the goodness and evil of man. Sweet, touching, sad, horrific. I cried a few times but no more so than at the end. A must read!
 Interesting
 Couldn't put this book down. I experienced and empathized with the emotions of a young girl and her family in Hitler's Germany told from the perspective of the grim reaper gathering the dead souls.
 Excellent book. I took the advice of my 15 year old to read this excellent book. Although I was a bit uncertain if I would enjoy it at the beginning, I persevered and soon started to enjoy the story line and found that I couldn't put it down. Markus Zusak has written a book which made me feel as if I was there with the characters. I highly recommend this book
 Of all the books I've read about WWII, The Book Thief was the best at showing the range of feelings the German people experienced as they were drawn into a war they may or may not have supported.  The further I got into the book, the more I cared about the characters, so I felt their sadness and grief as the war reached them right in their own homes.  It is a book I will remember.
 Enjoyed it.  I haven't seen the movie yet but now that I've read the book I'm looking forward to seeing this on the screen.  Keeps a good pace despite the length.
 I would recommend this book to anyone who can appreciate the truth about human existence without flinching. It is a beautiful story, for all the ugliness in it.
 Interesting
 This was an amazing book.<br/>I often say, that in this day of instant everything, the art of descriptive writing has been lost...<br/><br/>But every once and a while, I'm proven wrong...but never as profoundly until I read this...
 This book is awesome! It Is good for all ages and I really have been enjoying it.  I have read it before my grandkids did to see if it was up to there reading ability.  I would recommend it to everyone.
 I really enjoyed the book. Having the story told the way it was, was very interesting. The characters develop well and it keeps you to the end. I wish the movie could have gone as in depth, as this novel did. Well worth the read!
 This is an excellent book.  I loved the movie &amp; thoroughly enjoyed reading this book!
 The book is written from Death's perspective but is not morose or morbid. The writer pulls you in and you feel for the main character as she lives in Hitler's Germany.
 have not read yet. recommended highly. book a little worn than I thought, but, it'll still read well. very fast shipping.
 Kids school summer reading assignment
 Great book no matter what age you are. Loved it
 this is a wonderful book well written I  could not put it down! Leisel and Rudy were my favorite people. I recommend this  book as a must read :)
 This book was written differently than any book I have ever read.  It was haunting and beautiful and so real.
 Rarely do I have an emotional reaction to a book anymore, but the end of this book stole my heart and I sobbed for Leisel and her Mama and Papa and Rudy.<br/><br/>Such a rare tale to be told from the German side of WWII - not the Nazis but the German citizens who just tried to survive day to day.<br/><br/>I'll admit, the pacing of the book threw me off at first, but give it a chance, it's beautifully written and worth the read.
 Great Book!!
 It was hard to put down the book thief.  It was a very touching story about a girl during the war.  Loved it!
 The voice and format of this book was unique, as well as thoughtful.  The author brings you right into the story through an intimacy with the narrative character.
 I loved the writing style, especially the use of 'Death'! Although the story is tragic and sad, it also makes you smile and want for more as you get lost in Leisel's life. The use of humor throughout the story helps you cope with the evils of the era during which the book is wrote. There are many veins to this book with Leisel the link to connect them. Really loved it.
 Just finished a marvelous book by Mr. Markus Zusak. It's approach and point of view were unique, but absolutely correct for this story. A personal note: my spouse and I were privileged to have visited Dachau so visualizing the neighborhood and the strength of the characters was simple for me. I recommend this book highly. Excellent job, Mr. .
 This is a poignant book about the indignities the Jewish people suffered during the second world war.  To those of us who were too young to know much about the Nazi regime, this is an eye opener.
 I watched the movie before I read the book. As I had suspected the book offered many more laughs and tears. Markus has a way with words that make each character and moment come alive.
 I loved this book.  The characters were well developed and the story intriguing.
 This author captured personalities and emotions in a powerful way. Against the horror of war, there is love and redemption.
 Absolutely absorbing and skilfully written to bring out the worst and the best of the holocaust. A must read for anyone above 13. It may be a little difficult to comprehend for younger children. Though I had read it before this second reading on my kindle was great!
 This book of difficult subject and images is also beautiful and full of meaning for all.  It is hard to get through but well worth the struggle!
 I read a lot of WW2 fiction and nonfiction and I enjoyed the narrative coming from "death" himself.  It was an interesting take on a subject so widely written about.  I thought it was an easy read with well developed characters and story line.
 Although recommended for mature teens this book is a valid adult read, The subject matter has been reinterpreted many times but the Book Thief has given it a new voice. Do not think this is just the same story by a different author..
 I learned things from it but liked the movie better - the writing style was difficult to follow - I liked it
 Absolutely loved this book!  No wonder it is a best seller!
 Could not put this down. Love this period of fiction. Every character is riveting and you feel such empathy. A saga we all need to read and know that is not how life is supossed to be
 I loved this book. So interesting to see the ravages of WWII through the eyes of a young girl. The writing kept me engaged the whole time.
 What a wonderful story and the movie enhancment made it even better.
 An excellent view into the life of people during the Nazi dictatorship.  Specially a young woman who was separated at a very young age from everyone she loved.  It is a tale of survival and triumph over life's adversities.
 Well done and enjoyable depiction of Nazi Germany during the war without the usual rhetoric.
 A excellent read hard to put down enjoyed the book as a historical fiction captivated by the story line loved it
 This book is a difficult one to read if you take in what is really happening.  I have read it once.  I'm not sure I can read it again.  It is beautifully written.  it is telling and amazing.
 Awesome book - awesome story.  I'm not much for long reviews - sorry.
 This was an amazing read from a,different perspective. Full of emotion and harsh reality. A story that really puts the WWII German in a new light.
 I think it was an amazing book.  One that will stay with you for a long time.  Very uniquely written with Death as the Narrator.  It's one that you cannot put down and tugs at your heart strings.  You feel very glad that you have did not have to endure the terror of  World War 2.  I highly recommend it.
 I am not sure what I expected from this but the honesty,humor and simple beauty was wonderful. I would recommend this to my family and friends. It will be a long time before I leave Liesal behind.
 I love this book! I would love to teach it to a high school English class if I ever get back to that level. We get a whole new perspective of Death as well as Germans during WWII.
 One of the best book I have ever read.  The use of magical descriptions make the reader look for the next one.  The story uses these descriptions to help move the theme of the book forward.  If you like to read, this should be on your book bucket list. This is one of the few book I have read and re-read. My guess is that it will be the same for you.
 Haunting, individual stories played out about normal people in a horrible time dramatically reported by the famous observer,death.  I found this an usual way to learn about their lives.
 Don't really know how to articulate just how fascinating this book was.  I would definitely rate this book as a must read for everyone.
 Excellent book....a real page turner...written with a completely different twist.  I loved the movie but, of course, the book goes into greater detail.
 Great buy
 Very exiting book. Easy to read. Very unique approach in story telling. You will learn a lot about the history of Natsi germany.
 El mejor libro que he leído hasta ahora.
 Excellent book!!  I would highly recommend it. Great characters and a facinating plot make this book very interesting and thought provoking.
 I love this book! It is written in a very interesting way and that keeps the reading so much more enjoyable! I love the story and the main character and it makes us think a lot about the Hitler era, it is extremely good and enjoyable!
 This is one of the best-written books I've read.  It is spectacular.  Since I missed the movie, I wanted to read it.  It's just a great read and very hard to put down.  I felt like I was right there.
 The tragedies of war are made real through the telling of this book.  Human spirit rises to its height through the eyes of a child with s<br/>Death to her back.  In many ways a hard book to read , but well worth the endurance.  S. Christine
 This was a wonderful read. The characters were real. I would recommend this for anyone who loves a fiction that incorporates real times and places.
 A remarkable story of the power of words for life and for death and a story of coming of age in war torn Germany. Thought provoking, tear (even sob) producing.  A story to be read and reread.
 I thought it was an interesting twist on a much written about era that being Nazi  Germany. It took me a while to get into it and understand who the other main character was rather assuming it was the book thief. Warm and touching situations amidst some unruly and some nasty people.
 Well Written and Beautifully Disastrous. You knew what was going to happen but you couldn't put it down before it broke your heart in all the right ways.
 I wasn't prepared to like the characters as much as I did and when I cried at the end, I was surprised. It showed that not all Germans were Nazi and cruel.
 This is a very moving story. The story testifies to<br/>the extremes endured by the German people leading up to<br/>and during World War II.
 I didn't want to read this story but it drew me in and wouldn't let me go. A haunting tale of love and life and Death.
 I liked this book because it was written about a young girl growing up in the worst of times and yet had an admirable childhood!!!
 This is a beautiful, haunting book. It was a bit jarring at first to discover it's narrated by Death, but it fits once the story gets going. A wonderful, heart-wrenching story that had me sobbing a big ugly cry. Nothing wrong with that.
 A recent trip to Cologne, Germany, made this more meaniful to me.  My German heritage also helped!  The German youth today are required to learn the history of that terrible time.
 This story is told with exquisite details. As difficult as it is to read, it should be read by all. We must not allow history to repeat itself.
 Excellent book... I really enjoy books about WWII so thought this was an interesting perspective..Never read anything like it
 I almost didn't get this but I'm so glad I gave it a chance. The story was beautifully written with "death"as the narrator which made it even more interesting. Great story with a lot of depth about a very dark time in history.
 This is an amazing story. An adventure of a girl in Nazi Germany. Of course it's sad but it's also happy and wonderful.<br/>This is one of those books where I'll have to skip the movie. I'm going to keep the memory of the girl that I envisioned inside my own head. Hollywood always messes it up anyway.
 The book compares to "Diary of Anne Frank" from a different perspective.  The story is heart wrenching in its description of how a young orphan girl survives growing up in Nazi Germany and how she becomes a part of a loving family.  A great read.  I bought the audible version which I would recommend for the German pronunciations and diction.
 loved this book<br/>it was interesting to learn about this subject<br/>I could not put this book down at night
 The plot is very good but I did not like the author's style of writing.  I skimmed pages where the author rambled about stuff not relevant to the plot.  Text had "comments" in large bold print interspersed with the story which I found very unnecessary and distracting.  But the actual story is excellent.
 I would enjoy rereading this blood daily. the honesty and sincerity keeps my attention at all times. the SADNESS was so loving.
 Amazing book and very cleverly written.
 It was heartrenching and bittersweet.  A slant on yet another less mentioned group of WW2 victims.
 The Book Thief will (sorry) steal your heart and the characters will stay with you forever. Beautifully written and pretty much impossible to not devour in greedy chunks- the chapters disappear way to quickly.
 Used it in a Christmas basket for my mother in law with the movie and some candles.  Was a hit.
 ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS.
 Loved that Death was the narrator - seemed very strange at first, but the author did a great job personifying him.
 A very good read, not what you would expect.
 Our 11 year old grandson recently read The Book Thief so my wife and I decided to read it as well. It is clearly not just for the young.  It is full of wise and telling insights about children, adults, and the human spirit. Well written and thoroughly enjoyable
 Great story.  Enjoyed development of characters and the historical background of book.  Main character of girl was riveting and you cared about the characters from the beginning.
 Not the best book I've read, but gives perspective on Germans during World War Two. Not one I would suggest for light summer reading
 Excellent story and a creative style of storytelling. Empathy and compassion beat oppression in this tale of WWII. Wish I could read it again for the first time.
 Loved the unique writing style by this author. Hard at first but caught onto the style after a short bit.
 The third person narrative and intertwining stories of the victims of the holocaust, make this book hard to put down.
 This book describes words the need for them and the way we use them. The author told this throughout the story of a little book thief and that in itself is beautiful
 I like the way it was written. Quite intriguing and thoroughly enjoyable. Don't regret buying and it came at a great price.
 Loved this book!  the characters were so well developed, I became very attached to all of them.  The narrative style was very different and interesting.  The story was heartwarming at times and heartbreaking at others. Overall, very engrossing.
 Excellently written book which coinvolges totally and shows the aspect of WW II from another point of view. Highly recommended
 It makes you realize how easily the Holocaust happened and how it could happen again if people allow things they know are wrong to happen.  It's much easier to be a bystander.
 Well written but sad and felt that all lack of religious beliefs was odd but I understand that.  I would recommend this book.
 super
 If you can get over the hump of the first bit and connect with the characters and the unique point of view of the narrator, you will thank yourself later.
 Wonderful book.  I would recommend it.  Also saw the movie,. pretty true to the actual book and story line
 Tedious in some area, too heavy in others.
 It started out a little difficult to grasp what was going on, probably because accepting "death" as a character was hard.  Kept me engrossed right to the end with the writing style that made all the characters easy to "see".  Since the focus is on death in the end, advise having something more positive and upbeat to read next.
 Have read it three times and own the film version . . . can there be a higher compliment?  incredible, would like to know more about the author.
 A well written novel that really describes the complex nature of WWII from the perspective of Jews and Germans.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
 Throughout this book, the one telling the story is Death.  I wasn't sure I was going to like that, but I did. The perspective of this little girl and the others around her was a new thing, to me.  The way they lived, and suffered and the sacrifice the family made to help a Jewish man by hiding him was very impressive to me.  Expect a few tears.
 Listened to the book on CD when I was traveling and liked it so we'll I ordered a head copy for my 14 year old granddaughter.  It arrived quickly and in good condition.
 This book grabs you from the very first word to the last words of the narrator.  It is sad, but glorious, creating a constant paradox of emotions in the reader.
 I love this book. The story is wonderful but the writing of the story is exquisite. The author's turn of each phrase is at once lyrical and heartwrenching. I write, but I have never written anything this beautiful. I feel blessed for having read it. That said, don't see the movie. It will unnecessarily and greatly disappoint.
 Great Read.  Enjoying the book very much.  Would like to see the movie as well.  Happy I purchased it as well
 Such a good read!
 Excellent historical novel.  Very unusual, but appropriate, that death is the narrator!
 Very interesting style which makes the book and the story stand out! Something that the film could not do - it is not just about a story - it is how it is said to us!
 Excellent
 This was bought for my daughter as it's her favorite book.
 I thought it was a great book. I sawe the movie before I read the book and the movie doesn't even compare. There is so much detail that was missed in the movie. I would definitely recommend it.
 As is not surprising, the books is way better than the movie.  The authors chooses the absolute best words invented to give poetic elegance to this story
 This is the best book I've read in a long time.  Part history lesson, part love story, but mostly a story about courage, resilience, and the beauty and awfulness of humans.  I,m going to read it again.
 Very interesting take on a subject we've heard a lot about. Took a while to get used to the narrative style, but very well written in retrospect.
 This book didn't just tell a story, it lets you become part of the story. The character development is far superior to anything I've read in years.  I will re-read this many more times as I'm sure I've missed too many nuances. The words in this story are exquisite and represent the book thief perfectly.
 Loved the way this story was told.  A little confusing in the first few pages but then the characters stole into my soul.  The storyteller was a pleasant surprise. My appreciation of his observations  and reverance for the souls he is charged with, is both compelling and consoling.
 LOVED the story
 Unlike Leisel Meminger I am not great with words so I don't think mine will do this book justice. So I'll just say it's a must read.
 I absolutely loved this book.  It was a different style to that I normally read, but I am so glad a friend recommended it.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and was so sad to reach the end (in more ways than one).<br/><br/>I had never considered how World War 2 affected ordinary Germans who were just trying to survive through it.  A very thought provoking book that had me emotionally invested in the characters.  Would definitely recommend it!
 I live my life in books and I am haunted by humans. I find my peace in books and I work to make peace with humans. A story that will touch your soul.
 The best book I have read in years, possibly ever. Beautifully written, from the point of view of a most unique and unlikely narrator, with wit, heart, and devastation like I have rarely experienced in one novel. Brilliant.
 The writing was exquisite, really exquisite. This is how I would wish to write if I ever wrote a book. Great story, just can't say enough...second only to 'the Shack' for me...bravo!
 This is a really entertaining story.  I enjoyed it enough to rent the movie.  The book includes more than the movie did.  Really good story.
 The movie was much better. The book moves very slowly!  It's still a good read. Never read anything where God was in first person.
 The use of color analogies and the actual teller of the story made it so interesting. The author's descriptive writing was so compelling to read. It was interesting to see WWII from the German people view point. Beautiful story. Wonderful book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 I found this story to be haunting and beautiful.  I might say that this is the best book I have read in 40 years.  It is sad that the stories are so close to the truth of what had taken place in Nazi Germany.
 I really enjoyed the Book Thief. Was a book hard to put down. Covered all the emotions including tears. Good read.
 At the end, when he mentions that he has more stories like this, I had an immediate desire to know each of them.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book. It is one of the most beautifully written stories I have ever had the pleasure of reading. So touching, and amazing character development. I felt like I was in the basement with the characters. Very emotional.
 An excellent book. It was sad, but yet shows happiness and the strength of the human spirit during this terrible time in our history.  A must read.
 This book was just brilliant! I was a little confused at first while reading it but as the chapters went on it began to make sense. Well written and just brilliant is all I can say.
 IT WAS VERY SAD BUT I EXPECTED THAT ABOUT A BOOK FROM WORLD WAR II.  IT GAVE A GOOD PERSPECTIVE ON THE SIDE OF THE GERMANS WHO DID NOT SUPPORT THE WAR.  I CRIED, I OCCASIONALLY LAUGHED AND IT TOUCHED ME.  IT WAS WELL WRITTEN ALSO IN A WAY THAT I HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE.  BRAVO MARKUS ZUSAK!
 I love the fact the a girl can learn to love words as well as hate them. It was a very moving story of friendship love and family.
 The power of words and the human spirit are incredible!
 Just in the beginning of the book, but already loving it! Very sweet and sad
 Enjoyed the character development as well as the bits of humor even though set during a dismal period in history. I appreciated that the author was able to rise above the dismal and focus on how the main character was able to see in color as well as all shades of gray during a very black-and-white period in time.
 I love it. Brilliant, brutally emotional story from a rare vantage point. I wouldn't change a thing! Can't wait to see the movie also!
 A really good read with an interesting perspective on the impact of WWII on children.  The author is quite adept at vivid descriptions that are tinged with pathos and sublimity.  The story often lacks a clear narrative arc but that is part of its charm.  Magic realism and stream of consciousness collide to make a beautiful story.  I truly enjoyed it and was sorry when it was over.  From what I've heard, the movie didn't do it justice.
 This book is now tied for my all time favorite book!  (Which has not changed for 15 years.  I loved this book so much I'm giving it as gifts.  Perfect book!
 "The Book Thief"<br/>This was a good read from an unusual perspective. It kept me interested.  I have recommended to friends.
 A heart wrenching book. yet so full of life,  even though Death is the narrator.  I am intrigued about reading how the people were affected during this terrible tragedy.  I am of the belief we should never forget nor never let this happen again. The characters were strong and each unique not unlike many people in my life.  I really enjoyed the book and being an optimist. wanted a happy ending.
 Really enjoyed the book. It was hard to put down. I love to read, but am not a writer so I'll leave it at that. A great book! One that you hate for it to end.
 A little bit of a slow start but definitely worth it due to the very compelling story.  The development of the characters and their interrelationships is excellent, too!  Lots of symbolism so the book can be enjoyed on many levels as well.
 Love his writing style!!!  I've been looking for something intriguing, and unique, and this book is it!
 profound moving story with a unique perspective
 Love the language, some really stuck with me. Beautifully written, poignant and yet holds touches of humor. I think this is a beautiful, but sad book.
 I liked it.  It was yet another story of WWII from the German point of view.  It made you realize that not all Germans were Nazis and that they suffered as well as the rest of us.
 An excellent read. I highly recommend it to anyone. You will get lost in the richness of the writing.
 This book was really good. It kept me reading. I will say that if you haven't seen the movie first the book might be a bit confusing.
 Not in my usual wheel house of book selection, bought on the recommendation of a friend and loved it. Can't wait to see what his next recommendation is!! The Book Thief is captivating, uplifting, and heart-wrenching all at the same time, yet leaves you smiling at the simple things in life and trying to be a better person.
 wHEN i HAVe the time I will read it, I am not a person that waits to order, if I see something I would like to read then I order now and read later
 Excellent and well written. A peek into what the Germans had to endure in Nazi Germany.
 Super book.  Recommend it to one and all.  I am an avid reader and this is one of the best books I have read this year.
 The Book Thief is a beautifully written book about the coming of age of a young German girl, Liesel Meminger, in a small town during World War II.  The story is narrated by Death. Even though the story is filled with tragedy and loss, the author has managed to somehow not to make this story a morbid and depressing read.  When I finished the book, I immediately reopened it and starting reading it again.  That is how good this book is.
 This book is amazing. I've read it three times now and I've never run out of new nuances to pick up on. The characters are great, and the language that the author uses is beautiful. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an amazing and powerful read!
 Wanted to read before I saw the movie.  It is a very easy read.  A little confusing at first, but once you get it it is a very enjoyable read.
 The book is better than the movie.
 Important book - hope &amp; light for Trump times, albeit set in Nazi Germany. Lovely language lightly drawing the reader in. I finished it in tears, feeling profoundly moved &amp; strengthened for the year ahead. Totally recommend!!
 Well written and kept my interest to the end.  Characters well developed and the sense of Nazi evilness is in the background but ever present.
 Really enjoyed this book. It was an easy read and my heart went out the the main character, her life circumstances, and the people that were close to her. I have always enjoyed reading anything related to life during WWII and this book gave a different perspective compared to any I have read before.
 A story that will haunt you long after you finish.  Will probably keep and read again.
 It was a decent book. I dont understand why it was made into a movie though. It was nice to see the "german side" of the war
 I read this book after hearing it was going to become a movie. I'm glad I read it, the story telling is beautiful and heartwarming. I would defiantly recommend this book. Now I can sit down and watch the movie and compare the two. As always I'm sure the book will be better.
 Well written and heart warming. Seeing the movie gives one the opportunity to fully experience the heart break when a child is abandon and given to a family as household help rather than being loved. Beautifully written, easy to follow.
 Wow...it's written like no other book I've ever read and is a joy to read. I saw the movie first and if it were'nt impossible I'd say Zusak saw the movie before he wrote the book. That's how faithfully the casting director of the movie and the actors portrayed the book's characters. As is always the case, at least in my experience, the book provides much more and richer images.
 I liked this book very much. It is very different and sometimes a little confusing but I really enjoyed reading it.
 I thought this book was well written and enjoyed reading it. I passed it along to my mom and I'm sure that she will enjoy it as well.
 What an amazing book about the weaknesses and strengths of the human race!  One of the best accounts of what happened during those oppressive years of Hitlers reign.
 It took a while to get into this book, but once I did it was amazing. Great story and character development. It did gloss over the 'camp' down the road, but that was not really the focus of this story.
 good
 I enjoyed the book a lot, but at first it was a little difficult to follow. It is written in a way that I haven't seen before. I'm not saying that it wasn't enjoyable, I just had to get used to the way it was written. That's the only reason for the 4 stars.
 Absolutely loved this book. It makes one experience death in a whole new way, yet you experience life through the characters. Very well written!
 This book is beautiful. There is no other word for it. Zusak paints his pictures of life in Second World War Germany using thought provoking and unique imagery that keeps you turning page by page until, all too soon, you realise you've reached the end.<br/>Read it, please. It's well worth your while.<br/><br/>@DaveyNorthcott<br/> ...]
 I enjoyed reading this book I read it in 2 days.  Love the style of writing by this author.  Good read..
 Unbelievable. I had to stop several times because the material was so raw. Unforgettable, a must-read. Narrator point of view very original.
 Well written, I had a difficult time getting started with this book, but once I got past the first couple chapters I didn't want to put the book down.
 It was a little slow to start. However, as the story progressed, the thought of death as an entity was strangely comforting.
 Laughed and cried and enjoyed it all!!  Thought provoking in it's entirety. I would recommend this to all if my friends
 Best word to describe this book - amazing!  It makes you both cry and smile and often at the same time. A very unique perspective on a terrible time in this world's history.  This book will stay with me for a long time.
 This was the best book I've read all year! I love the way the author uses words. I highly recommend The Book Thief. One word of caution: bring tissues!
 I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone with a desire to see into the human heart, through the eyes of a young girl. You see the difficulties and choices that we all make everyday and how they can change the lives of those around us as we'll.
 Loved the movie and enjoyed the book. I would recommend it especially to young teens and the young at heart of any age. Precious narrative of life's twists and turns and how little of it we control.
 Historically of interest, perceptive, sensitive and very readable.<br/>Highly recommend ----sad but wonderful reading.<br/>Makes one unerstand the diversity of the German character/approach during the Hitler era.
 Beautifully written!!! Lovely and sorrowful all at the same time. Paints a vivid picture of life in war-torn Germany and the tragedies of the holocaust.
 Well written, absorbing. This writes about Nazi Germany from the point of view of ordinary people living in a German village.<br/><br/>Lovely writing and a moving tale. Focuses on children's viewpoint.
 Dcrvd rg rg. Rvr you u rg h to ef h f the rg rg y f ycd y d ht
 It looks at those horrible times in a different perspective than usual. I think it would do well to introduce it in schools as a preferred reading assignment.  It would work in both English and History classes.  Deeply moving.
 Excellent story development. Narration and unique drawings were different and interesting.
 beautifully written. I loved it. I smiled. I cried. very tenderly and cleverly written. a must read. love triumphs all even in the worst of circumstances.Linda davies
 Excellent book! A must read about the daily life and culture of living in Nazi Germany.
 Outstanding book. It shows the strong human impulse to life, despite horrible circumstances.
 Great story, one thing I loved was the way that the author told it. When you are reading about the charactor, you really feel what they are feeling.
 Came in great condition and my roommate loves reading this book!
 The book gives a heartbreaking look at what the German people especially children suffered during ww2 and reminds us there were those who didn't hate the Jews
 This book actually starts out rather dark &amp; I thought of putting it down, but as you get into the story, it is a deeply moving experience! I loved the writing &amp; how it touches your heart in many places as it reveals the human's desire to survive in life &amp; love!
 Read it on a sunny day  😩
 I'm not sure what I expected but I expected more action than received.  The end was a complete let down.
 great story did not like the writing style.recommend the book to most older teenagers.great story remember that when trying to get past the writing style.
 An amazing and emotional read. A+++. This will be read and re-read. My daughter read this first, and recommended it to me. I lived it and also highly recommended.
 I highly recommend this book to anyone who is old enough to deal with holocaust themes. It is well written and uses a very different way of telling the story.
 I found this story mesmerizing -- it is very sad, though.  I would read it again just for the imagery.
 Enjoyable but a little dark.
 Couldn't get into this book. I eventually gave it up.
 great book to read about the holocaust told from the view of German child.
 I LOVED this book. Amazing writing. Touching story.
 I completely fell in love with the book, it will make you laugh, cry and be in suspense all at the same time.
 i thought it was terrific,it moved me deeply. very rarely do we glimpse ww II through the eyes of the everyday german people.
 One of my favorite reads in the past 10 years.  I enthusiastically recommend this book to all my friends and those in book clubs.
 a lil over half way its a good read
 I quite reading after 100 pages. Although beautifully written, I just cannot read one more book detailing atrocities and horrors committed by human beings. An important read for those who may not have read numerous other books whose characters were involved with the holocaust. I am just tired of being depressed after reading a book - I want uplifting, entertaining books for awhile. In fairness to the author, it is painstakingly researched, the prose is lovely and the descriptions allow you to transport yourself into the story. Which is what caused me to shut the book and donate it to the local library. It's horrifying - and I have read far too much on the subject already.
 Its nice that death is the narrator, the final chapter is nice, a little harsh and kind of tabloid, but nice
 This book had my attention then entire time. I really couldn't put it down. I absolutely loved that it was in the perspective of death AND Liesel. It's truth VS innocence. I recommend to anyone who has an interest in holocaust history.
 This is a great book, looking at a difficult time of life from another outlook.  Strange to think it is written in the first person of Death, but I could certainly relate to the Book Thief herself.  Recommended you should read this one.
 Once I adapted to the creative, free-form writing style, I loved this story.  The main characters were somewhat stereo typical, but the voice of this book kept me intrigued.  As adults, the events of this war story are familiar and dramatic, but the young heroine of  this story experiencies them from an adolescent perspective.  This would be a good companion to Diary of Ann Frank for youthful readers.
 It was a wonderful book.  It did start slowly but once into it I could not put it down.  I recommend this highly
 When I started reading this book I thought how depressing, but as I continued reading it I couldn't put it down. I came to care about each character as an old friend. I recommend this book to older age teens and above.
 Good read.  The movie was also great, although it wasn't in our theater very long.  Amazing courage for all of these people during this time.
 Looking at the intimate lives of holocaust victims from a very personal, intelligent perspective and at the same time viewing humanity and its most beautiful and ugliest capabilities.<br/>Molly K.
 This was a great read.  It's the first book I've read on the Kindle Fire HD.  I love the feel of the real books and was hesitant to get a Kindle, but I did not miss the real book.<br/><br/>The story was fantastic and takes you through a full range of emotions.  Definitely a different perspective for story telling as well.  Great book to curl up by the fire with.
 I had no interest in the movie until a friend recommended the book to me! Great read! Now I'm ready for the movie.
 I did not read a summary of this book, but I read it for its popularity. A sad tale told brilliantly, The Book Thief draws us into the story.
 Best book I've ever read.
 I liked the writing style of the author very much especially in the context of the story and Germany during WW II.
 This book was very well written. I loved the characters and the story.
 Very good book by grandson told me to read it he was reading it in school was very good
 Meh.<br/><br/>Could have been better. Liked that it was narrated by death-an interesting concept. The author had so many could-be story lines that just fell flat as soon as I got really interested in them.
 I fell into her world and heard death as if it spoke aloud. Engaging.  Real. Tragic. Beautiful. What a new face to an old time.
 It took me a few chapters to get used to the unique writing style.  However, once I got into it, this book was amazing!  I recommended it to my mom and my brother; both of them also loved the book.
 Well written, well researched and original. Amazing perspectives used and enthralling.  I am not sure what else to say beyond - Just read it.
 It took a chapter or two to get into but once I caught on it was great. Love the dialogue and story line and the factual history in it as well.
 The Book Thief is probably The saddest book I've ever read. I bawled until i couldn't anymore, it was so well written. I recommend you read it only if you don't mind really sad things, you like sad things, or if you just want to read one of the greatest books of the millennium. It's changed my view on not only world war 2, but life. It makes you realize that things aren't always how the seem to be and that there's always another side to a story. It's very sad, but times then were, and it's better not to be ignorant.
 This book was incredibly sad and touching.  I didn't want it to end.  I must admit I saw the movie first but it wasn't near as good as the book.
 I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves WWII, the love for education, and the importance of family and friendship​ will love this book.
 I loved how this book was structured and built the story along the way. It is really unique in the way that it doesn't hold information from the reader whilst building exactly the right amount of tension and forcing the reader on, I couldn't put it down. As a book set at the time of the Holocaust you expect a gloom and there was a sense of that but at the same time a wonderful sense of hope and goodness. Definitely a book I would recommend to everyone.
 My son needed to see this for his Freshman AP English summer class .... The movie was very good.
 If I had ever known how this book would end I would have never read.  And would have truly been the saddest part!
 The book was excellent.  Your emotions will run the gamut as you read this compelling story.  I chose this to read after seeing a preview to the upcoming movie.  So glad I read the book.  Always more details.  The story is a great reminder of the holocaust and the devastating affect it had on everyone.  I couldn't put it down.
 Wonderful writing and wonderful themes in the book.  Death as narrator could turn folks off, but how he used Death and personified it was a wonderful thing.<br/>A different perspective of the Holocaust - that of the regular German in a small town.
 I listened to it on my Kindle.  It seemed "slow" and was difficult to keep my attention.  I did not like the mother character, such a harsh individual.  Father was a good person with a kind heart.  I understand the movie is quite good.
 This book was harder to get into,but I really loved it and have recommended it to my neighbor,who also enjoys the same books that I like.
 Please read this book and DO NOT see the movie.  Book is beautiful written and very poignant
 This book was written in a different way, from a unique point of view.  It was a page turner with an amazing ending.  It could actually move the gentle reader to tears.
 Amazing. Weepy. Beautiful. Makes you have the feels. And the point of view. Amazing. Gonna need to quit crying now
 Even though the theme is painful, I think it would be suitable for a more mature young reader. I gave it to my 12 year oldgranddaughter for Xmas .
 I often read books quickly and just as quickly forget them.  This one is different.  Beautiful character development, with the narrator of the story being someone quite unexpected.  I find myself thinking about Liesel and admiring her - this is a great coming-of-age story set in modern history's most difficult time and place.
 How can a book which tells you right away how it ends be so fulfilling? At first the narrator is unbelievable, but it doesn't take long to accept death telling a warm-hearted story about courage and loss. This is beautiful and brilliant.
 This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  Rarely do I read a book twice.  I may read this one again right now.
 This book I  so well written that you can't put it down, even when something terrible is  coming.  It is sweet and sour at th  same time.  You learn and you feel and want to cry but can't. Love  it
 A historical fiction set in Nazi Germany, great character development.  Struggles, hardships, love and family.  Compelling story of survival and love of books.  Loved this book
 A good book,  It was an interesting view of the life of Germans during WWII.  I was drawn into the story through the characters and felt empathy for the little book thief.
 This book is an excellent example of elements of great writing! The descriptive word pictures are phenomenal! The story itself is captivating. I love the relationships and how they mature throughout the book. Really worth the read!
 This was a Christmas present for my 13 year old son at his request.  I dont know the content but he didnt put it down and finished it in 2 days.
 Markus Zusak has brought the humanity and "humanness" that takes you into a hushed world that lives inspite of itself. The author places his characters in a dangerous place, yet with innocence he brings the time in history to life.
 I was so surprised that I didn't like this book. I'd heard nothing but good things about it and I had such high expectations.  When I started, I thought Death as the narrator was an innovative approach. Yet I was bewildered: why wasn't I engrossed by this book? I kept reading, hoping that something would catch my interest. Eventually though, I had to come to terms with it: I just didn't like the book. I tried repeatedly to explain why I didn't like the book and I have three conclusions. I couldn't connect with the characters, the narrator's disruptive commentary got in the way of the story, and the overall it just left me sad and not in good makes you so emotional you want to cry. Just sad and thinking at the end, well that sucks.<br/>I think the lack of connection to the characters is because none of them are telling the story. Death sometimes gives you a hint what they're thinking or feeling, but it's like trying to tell the story of someone you don't know. There were glimmers of emotion but then a chapter would suddenly end and the bizarre and sometimes cliché comments of the narrator.<br/>Then there is the overall issue of the narration.  I hated the fact that he told you characters were going to die and then you get no more detail until the last few chapters.  For me, it's like someone telling me the end of the story. I sit there and think, why keep reading? I know what happens. I also felt as if the author wanted there to be these quotable phrases in the book and it seemed like he was trying too hard.  It sounded trite and sometimes downright pompous. And I must admit, my dislike for this book increased exponentially when Liesel says to her dead foster mother: "God damn it, you were so beautiful." It was as if she would have to be pounding her fist and shouting "Why?!"<br/>Of course I didn't expect a book about Nazi Germany to be a happy feel good book but every good moment in the book is robbed by some horrible atrocity and then the end is so completely depressing.  Then when I read the epilog, I thought why did he even bother with this chapter? At the end of this book, I felt sad and robbed. It seemed incomplete with no closure other than death.
 It's everything you love about reading but it's about one of the most unendurable times of human existence<br/>Worth it.
 Very touching especially when I figured out who was telling the story!  I won't ruin it by telling you.
 This book is cleverly written. You won't be able to put it down. The cleverness of the writing style is beautiful.
 This is a precious story.  I love to read and can appreciate the value of a good book.  We take so much for granted.
 Just as good the second time around. World War II from a different perspective. Makes me look at the world differently.
 I liked this book but the first few chapters were kind of weird. But the further I got into the book the more I liked it. I would read more of his books.
 A grim reaper, a child in Nazi Germany, poverty, a Jew in hiding, and war are parts of this interesting novel.
 Book is a little hard to get into, but trust me and keep reading. It got so good, i couldn't put the book down for hours.
 I took a long time to finish the book, read another book in between.<br/>It was just not a book that would hold me. Still wanted to know what happen in the end.
 Great story line. Sad but showing the survival spirit of man kind
 wonderful story
 If you read no other book read this one.  The narrator is death and he tells a great story.  Read It.
 this riveting tale is narrated by Death.  There are many heroic characters portrayed in Germany.  Not all the populace believed in the atrocities perpetrated by the government.
 Such an engrossing and engaging book.  I have recommended (and more than a few time bought the book for) everyone I know.
 This was a book club read. We enjoyed the development of the characters and was interesting that the book was written by Death.
 Some of the most beautiful writing. This has become my favorite book.  One that I will read again and again. Perfection
 A good page turner with different twists along the way. A tale told by an observer. Sad, tender. and thought provoking. I enjoyed it very much
 Good read.
 It was a revelation to read a tale which focused on an ordinary German street, in a poor area of Munich, with ordinary people as the hero's and heroine's. To read of the hardship these people experienced during the terrible days of World War 2, was a revealing experience of the difficulties of the "other" side during these war years. Well done Markus Zusak
 Well drawn out characters.  Perspective of narrator is fascinating and mesmerizing.  Required reading.  Manages to give point of view of Germans living during that era without judging. Excellent.
 I don't know what it was but I loved this book.  I loved the story and just everything about it.
 Very interesting and poignant.
 It's an easy read. Great story. Not true, but contains events that could have happened during the war.<br/>I now need to see the movie.
 These characters will be with me now, always. Indelible, unique, utterly human. Loved this book.  Recommend this story to everyone
 I am only about 1/2 way done and I am enjoying it so far!  Anxious to find out the ending!
 I liked the absolute passion Leisel had for books and the value she placed on reading and writing as a way to make sense of her life as an adopted child in a Jewish neighborhood during Hitler's reign of terror.
 It was a great story, told in a very different manner (death is the story teller).  I would highly recommend this book!
 One of my favorites this year. A WWII story, yet not on the battlefield.
 A most intriguing and well put together tale, told by Death. I found myself constantly entertained by the tale of the Book Thief.
 This book will grab you on page one and never let go. You may finish the book, but you will not forget The Book Thief
 The Holocaust is not my favourite subject and I tend to avoid books on this subject and any books on wars in general, but this book is brilliantly and differently written. It took some getting used to especially as Death is the narrator. Strange but it will hook you! I read the ending on the plane home from my holiday and sobbed and sobbed! Read this amazing book - it will stay with you for a long time.
 This was really good. Made me want to research more books during the time. Very well written.
 Interesting twist from death's perspective!
 Best book of that year, and one of the best I have ever read!!
 A little difficult to get into at first but built to a great ending. It was nice to have the German point of view and how some reacted to the words of Hitler.
 Loved this story and was wishing I had purchased the book so I could give to someone to read (I bought it for my Kindle) I have read many different books based on Hitler's Germany, and was<br/> captivated by Markus's ability to paint his characters so vividly and portray that time and place so effectively. This is one of my favorite books. Well done!
 It was a sad tale of tragedies brought on by war time. The fact that the heroine was able to consider life normal enough to grow and feed her enquiring mind was commendable. The love of books is a wonderful gift
 This was a wonderfully touching story.  I resisted reading it because of it being set in the time of Nazi Germany.  Such books are heavy and haunting and I have to be in a certain frame of mind.  This book did leave me crying but not because of what I expected.  It was sad but hopeful and is a story that describes both the horrors but more importantly the wonders of human beings.
 Loved the unique narration of this book.  The story is very compelling and paints a vivid picture of German life during WWII.  Now that I've read the book, I will watch the movid.
 Very good book and it depicted a side of the War I was not familiar with, it also was a good read after seeing the Movie.
 While writing on a horrific subject, Zusak allowed us to see this time period through the eyes of a child. He uses subtle humor, strong characterizations, and mesmerizing descriptions, which I often had to stop to reread.<br/><br/>I lapped up his language. This is the first time I have chosen to reread a book. Now that I know the gist of the story line, I am rereading for the beauty of his word choices and subtleties embedded in the story line. I also relished his use of  writing techniques which I have not seen used by other authors.<br/><br/>This is a masterful book, and one that will stay with you long after you have finished reading.
 Sad story about sad times with just enough humor and suspense to keep you glued to the pages!  Definitely would recommend
 Loved the story, the character development, and the historical setting. The author's method was quite unusual, but effective. I would recommend.
 This is one of the best novels I've ever read. The book is well written, the characters are interesting, and there's humor in it, mainly from Death who narrates the story. I would highly recommend reading this book.
 Written like poetry, this book is full of feeling. It's a world of war which I never want to experience and is hard to read about. But the writing is so beautiful. I have never read anything like it.
 This is possibly the best book you will read this year, so good that I am putting off seeing the movie, want to let the book settle in my head first.
 Beautifully written. I have just finished this wonderful book and I am lost for words. It leaves you wanting to devore as many good books and you can steal away the time for.
 We did it as a book club selection - discussed it and then showed the movie. The gals thought<br/>the same as myself overall.
 my grandaughter and I read this book together!  she is 13 and we both loved it! without a doubt great summer read
 I RECOMMEND IT CONSTANTLY.
 This was the kind of book I desperately hope for when choosing a book to read. I imagined myself personally witnessing every page.  What a gift it is to be able to write a book that evokes so much emotion in its reader.  Not your usual narrator...odd but intriguing. Bravo Markus!
 I really liked this book, until I got 3/4 thru and realized I read it years ago!!  It's a great book, though, and the movie was good, too.
 A wonderful book. It was realistic and not sugar coated. It was a terrible time in history without happy endings.
 Rarely have I had the opportunity to hold this book multiple times. I had an opportunity to read it when I took the Book Thief off a friend's hands. I read it, but  I purchased the volume to give as a gift to another friend. This is one of the few times I have paid it forward to share literature with other people.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise of my purchase was that this domino-filled cover was not the cover I received. Instead eyes warily peep over the folds of a book and just below that is a cobbled city street. If that was the singular surprise, then it was a good surprise, and less unpleasant than I would have expected.
 This is a fantastic book.  I can't say enough good things about it.  It clearly illustrates how important books are to the human race and how reading feeds a part of your soul.  A must read!
 I felt like I was right there with them on this journey. What a page turner. I sing could not put it down. This was one of the best books I have ever read. I highly recommend this book. This was a 5 star.
 Profound and passionate writing. The use of a highly unusual "omniscient narrator" is brilliant, coupled with the overview of the child. Loved this book!
 I heard great reviews about this book and the movie, but the style of writing is different and I'm having a hard time getting into the story.
 great book  good service  good condition  wonderful story, you wil love liesel and her family, could not put down, enjoyed it so much.
 This book was really interesting and an excellent read. It's not the normal type of literature I read, but for this type of literature it was really good.
 Loved it.
 I loved this book! The story is narrarated by a rather witty "angel of death", which in and of itself gives the story an interesting spin.  The characters are wonderful, expressing a full gamit of personalities and underlying motivations. It was also very interesting to read a World War II story from a German perspective, yet still have a story which doesn't diminish the horrific Jewish experience.  And as heart wrenching as the story was, you are left with a sense of hope that makes you want to go out and do something to change the world.
 I had first read The Book Thief after borrowing it from a local library and knew I had to get it for myself. I looked up retailers that were selling it for a good price and found one here. The book was is excellent condition and didn't take very long to arrive. 5 out of 5 because when I contacted the buyer, my response was polite and to the point. I will always buy from the buyer I did from now on.
 I was held captive by Zusak's use of words, yes, words. He created a world that seemed so real even with his surreal descriptions of words that sat on shoulders. Not to mention the characters who represent those who lived and died during a most awful part of our world's history. Zusak is a masterful artist. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves the power of words.
 I read constantly. Never before have I read a book like this.It is bittersweet and anger provoking at the same time.  Well written. Unique.
 On my top ten list.  Beautifully written. Although the style is very different I got used to it quickly.  A side of the holocaust I have not often read about.  Characters a very well drawn.  I just loved this book.
 Sensitive and touching story.  Well written.
 A 'grabbing' book. Mind catching&amp;thought provoking.  My understanding is that this book is for mid teens &amp; older.  I think alot of younger people would struggle to keep up with the flow of thought(would have given it a5star only for this age 'rating'). However I most definitely recommend it as an essential read
 One of the best books I've ever read...and I've read literally/easily more than 1000.  I bought it as a gift for a former colleague and friend...  and she and her daughters got the hardback while I kept my paperback that I've read twice and will read again sometime in the future.  I will also buy the movie when it comes out on blu-ray.
 Great read...loved it!
 this ebbok was great i real some of it every night before i went to bed thank you so much
 One of my favorites....history and real life rolled into one.
 I had no idea where this book was going. It's a great tale during a dark period of history. Diesel is an amazing child filled with such a adult mind.
 I enjoyed this story and I saw the movie afterwards and felt it stayed mostly with the book.
 Well written. Thoughtful. An excellent perspective of WW2.
 Couldn't put it down. Historical, plus Death as the narrator was captivating. All humans have good and bad actions and decisions. Words and language can be used for purposes both good and evil.
 I love the way this book is written. It was interesting to look at the way of life for the Germans during that awful time. I hope no one ever forgets the sadness and shame that everyone stuffed.
 Touching story.  The characters really came to life for me.  At first I was taken off guard that the story is narrated by Death but I really came to like him and his soothing voice.
 Other reviews are much better than I could write, but wanted to get my vote in as an all-time favorite. You will not be disappointed. Long read, but well worth your investment.
 Great story from many points of view.  I believed in the characters and found it hopeful and uplifting even though the historical period was so tragic.
 Excellent study of the dynamics of prejudice and contrasting kindness through the story of a young girl in WW II Germany.
 I have never wept as did at the last chapters of this book. I felt so much love for the wonderful characters in the book. I missed seeing the movie, and I am glad I could read the book. Knowing how played Papa in the movie, he was well sated
 Told primarily through the experiences of two children by a sympathetic narrator, Death, we are treated to beautiful acts of humanity against the backdrop of Nazi inhumanity. The movie does a good job of telling the story that is best experienced by reading the book.
 Even though the content was sad and a reminder of a horrible time, the book kept my interest. The story of this young girl let you know what life was like for her during that time in history.
 Love the ability to purchase book for my kids online. Makes life easier.
 I would recommend this book to persons who love a great story albeit not a happy story. A story of history and the hell people of Germany went through during the war. Of love and compassion.
 I am a senior who loved this book so much I bought it for my 14 y.o. granddaughter for Christmas.  Wonderfully written.  A very sad time in history is given a child's perspective.  Loved it.
 Excellent book. Fits with the movie very well. I highly recommend it.
 This was the best book I've read in a while, I couldn't put it down! It was written from such a unique perspective and the author made you feel almost like you were there. I loved this book and even though I typically don't read a book more than once this is one I plan to read again!
 I loved how the author used adjectives that are normally used for living things to describe inanimate objects.  I loved the references to color.  The descriptions were marvelous like "the cookies were bolted to the plate" or "teeth were elbowing each other."  It was a wonderful story, exquisitely told!
 I feel this book is very interesting and a good learning experience for high school students to read and learn about.
 I read this book in less than a week. it was easy to read but totally caught my interest. the story line was not complex which made it easy to pick up and put down when needed. I enjoyed the way the story was told as well.
 the writing is amazing. And the story of this amazing little girl is gripping and heart felt.  I laughed and cried. I was sad when the book was over!
 I truly enjoyed the story being written from the perspective of the narrator, Death. I could not put the story down. The story keeps you gripped in suspense as the story unfolds while treating you to humor and sorrow throughout.
 Bought this book so I could read it before I watched the movie.  It had me from the first page.  Great plot and fabulous writing.
 A terrific read for adults and teens alike.  Characters you really care about and a story that keeps you captivated.
 I loved the movie, and so I had to read the book, and I loved them both, and the book followed the movie pretty well.
 This is a wonderful read.  Kept my interest throughout....and I was sad when the story came to end.  I've already recommended it to friends.
 at first the whole 'death as narrator's thing feels too gimmicky and you want to put it down, but it's a good read if you stick with it.
 The unusual format of Death as the narrator.  The suspense which caused me to want to continue reading even if there was no time.  The sorrow and reminder of a horrific past.
 this book is full of mixed emotions that are happy and sorrowful. In the book Liesel Meminger goes through adventures and books - that she stole.<br/>This book is a great edge of your seat type and will pull your emotions to the edge till the very end.
 Drew me in from the beginning!  A beautiful story during a very terrible time in history.
 Read this book it is absolutely amazing
 I'm a lifetime reader and my lifetime is at 64...this is one of the 5 BEST books I have ever read!
 Highly recommended.  Very Powerful.  A creatively written story. A good story for anyone interested in the holocaust.  I can't wait to read more from this author.
 I use my kindle all the time and the inexpensive choices and the ease of ordering makes my experience with amazon a breeze
 The writing in this book is wonderful.  Vivid images and colorful language flows easily throughout this book.  The unusual fast-forwarding and then returning to present was intriguing.  So many wonderful characters.  Very well written.  Definitely deserves a second reading.
 As always, so much better than the movie. A different perspective of WWII Germany.
 I saw the movie first and then read the book. I enjoyed the movie but felt that I needed some more explanation. The book was an easy read. The characters where relatable and the story gave an insight in how it could have been for some Germans during WW2. I finished the book a few days ago but the characters stayed with me and made me think as Zusak made them come to life and I'm sad for what they had to go through,
 It was a great book. It was a little hard to follow in certain areas, but I enjoyed it.
 This is one of the best books to capture both the terrible sorrows and the amazing grace and beauty that occurred during one of the darkest hours in our history. If you read it you will not forget it.
 This book was every type of novel rolled into one. There was mystery, romance, comedy, drama, history...Although I didn't think this was my kind of book at first, I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed this story and would recommend this book. This book elicits a lot of emotions.
 Great read. Hauntingly beautiful, couldn't put it down. Would be a great book to read in middle school to learn a bit world war 2
 At first, I wanted to just stop reading. However, I am so happy that I actually<br/>went back to the beginning, started re-reading, and then could not put it down.<br/>Awesome!
 I loved how the author used his play on words in this book. It was very well written and a good story. The story is sad but I loved the way it was written.
 Written in the first person by Death, this book had a unique quality and tenderness to it that I found refreshing. In addition to an interesting storyline, the colorful descriptions painted a portrait of a time in Germany that all need to remember.
 Bought this for my sister. It came in perfect condition. Quality materials. Durable. Just as expected. Very pleased with this purchase.
 I found this book a page turner, but hard to read in part due to content. it was a hard time to be alive, either as adult or child. it is a reminder that if we don't remain vigilant in our society, history will repeat itself. I wish I could be half as brave
 Great read.<br/><br/>This was a book assigned to our book club, and I'm eager to meet with the group and discuss this bittersweet work of art.
 Loved the perspective<br/>Excellent book for all ages<br/>One of the best I have ever read<br/>Highly recommend!<br/>Wish I had a hard copy to share with my friends.
 If you aren't touched by reading this book, I think you might be soulless. A touching story. So very moving.
 Extraordinary story that is vibrantly portrayed by the author.  Excellent look at what it took to live through the Nazi years as a Jewish child and family.
 I liked death as the narrator and the way the story was organized. The character development was very good - I mainly kept reading because I wanted to find out what happens to everybody. It was also interesting to read about the war from a German point of view and through the eyes of several different people. The book will resonate w/ all those who love words, acknowledge their power, and feel they can't live without something to read.
 great book, on time.
 A book that will stay with you long after you read the last page.  That the story was told from the perspective of death was both chilling and brilliant.  Truly a worthwhile book.
 As someone who lived in Germany after the war, I saw the ghosts of these people. How such a young author could see them, I don't know.
 Brilliantly crafted novel of the ugliness of Hitler's Germany and the power of humans to care for and love each other even in times of great danger to themselves.
 Took me back in time. Actually felt I was there, which is what I love about a great book, where you feel transported and lost in the story.
 Still only halfway through, and it's interesting but not capturing like I hoped it would be.  Maybe because the movie previews seemed better.
 Excellent book ! Couldn't put it down !!
 I loved this book.  The narration took a little getting used to, but it added so much to the story.  I am interested to see how the movie holds up.
 Such a sweet tale for the  tragic holocaust times. Beautifully told from an unlikely perspective. I loved it so much I read it twice
 A wonderful story. I truly recommend this book. I found myself caring greatly for this girl and her family and friends.
 I really liked the characters and felt like I knew them.I picked this book because I heard it was a good movie. I did have a hard time understanding the narrator. I am still not sure who he was exactly..(I think death)?? I wish also the ending was different.
 What a book! I was startled by the format at first but ended up being carried by the story. Haunting.
 Thought provoking book about life in Hitler's World if you were Jewish or friendly to Jews. Yet it is based on a young girls perspective and has a lot to do with human nature in any adverse situation.
 I read this book as a book club selection. I hung in there up to the last hundred pages before giving up. I found it tedious and predictable, simple minded and sentimental. It's marketed as a book for young adults but I would be reluctant to recommend this to a teenager because of the unnecessary crude language. I know that they know these words but still... There are better ways to learn about Jews in wartime Germany. The writing is poor: bad grammar, strange similes and metaphors. They made a movie out this book and for once the movie is better.
 Though I'm only half thrum it. It's settup different than most I read..but it keeps me interested. I wish I could read it without interuption.
 You will not be disappointed in this book.  It certainly keeps you turning the pages till you become totally engrossed in the story. I saw the movie after I had read the book and although I enjoyed the movie, it's not as good as the book.
 I was surprised how the Book Thief was written( in the third person) but most effective way of telling the story which is sad but true as to the effects WWII had one the German people.
 This story is a life changing one.  It stays with you long after the last page is turned. The movie based on it is one of the best movies I have ever seen, if not the best.
 This book definitely has you thinking outside of the box. Not sure I'd read it again, but it was definitely a good read
 Fabulous! A heartbreakingly real tale of this sad part of modern history, thoroughly researched and written with utmost clarity and skill. Can't wait for the next Markus Zusak novel!
 Just lovely. Well written. A beautiful story.  A new perspective on Nazi Germany.  I laughed, I cried, and I was not ready for the story to end.
 great
 I must say that I bought this book because I had heard that the movie was wonderful. I am one who never watches a movie before reading the book it is based upon. That being said, this is by far one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read. The characters become dear to you, and the unique perspective on one of the greatest tragedies in world history is simultaneously refreshing and poignantly sobering. A must-read.
 The author captured the emotion of the characters so well I am truly sad they are gone. They feel like family. This book was rich and fulfilling and I want more.
 Narrated by death. A very unique book. It  took me a bit to get use to the writing style but once I did I found this to be a fast read. I think if this had been narrated in any other way it would have taken away from the story. This is an important book that everyone should read as a reminder we  never forget the horrific times so many innocent people lived or died through. This story is told from a different perspective.
 This is a must read. I cried my eyes out in this book. This book is so real it is crazy and my hearts breaks non-stop in this amazing book.
 Wonderful historical fiction. Brings the time of Hitler and Jewish concentration camps to reality for the reader.
 Loved the book
 you will lose your heart to this book by far the best book ive read in along time.  Highly developed complex characters that give so many different views of a heartbreaking time in history. With an ending you wont forget.
 Great read!  I learned things about WWII from the perspective of  someone that was right there all the time.  Highly recommend this book.
 Very sad book, but could not put it down.  Foul language unnecessary, but may have been added to make it realistic.  We always think about the US side if historical events.  It was interesting to see the other side.
 This story makes you take a close look at how good and how bad humans can be. I would recommend this to anyone who has a big heart like Liesel, Hans, Rosa and Max and Rudy had.
 It was very good to see things from the other side during this book and realizing what some of the Germans went through as well.
 I'm not sure which is more compelling - the plot or the language. This book tugs at your heart and your mind at the same time.<br/><br/>Brilliant!
 Fabulous book!!!  I purchased as gifts because I've loaned my copy out to so many- everyone loves it!!  The story is from a perspective I've never read from before.
 A thoroughly enjoyable read with beautiful writing. Zusak's descriptive writing was a highlight of the book. It was interesting to have the story told from "Death's" viewpoint.
 I recently read this while traveling through southern Germany and Austria.  Zusak uses such simple, powerful words to paint such<br/>stirring pictures.
 A very bitter sweet book about a young girl during World War II.  As they say a page turner......<br/>I love reading a book that has a good story but also has history to it.
 I always wait to watch a movie if based on a book.  I was very touched by this story.  There is saddness and sweetness to the book.
 Very good
 The beginning of the book was a bit confusing, but the story developed as you went along and was easier to understand.
 What an incredible read!  Having the voice of Death walk us through the story was pure brilliance. I love stories about the Holocaust anyway, but this unique perspective and lyrical writing style was completely addictive. One of the best I've ever read...and that is saying something!
 one.of.the most amazing books I have read in a long time. it touched my heart in so many ways. I would be sitting somewhere reading and start crying in public.it is the first book I have read (and I have read many,many books) that I have wanted to send a message to the author about what an amazing body of work this was. truly inspired!
 What a book! So different than any other book I've read before. The author writes so beautifully! And such a thrilling, emotional, heart wrenching story.
 The biggest problem with this book is that once I started reading it, I did not want to put it down.  I had seen the movie, but the book is so much richer.  I pretty much read it in one sitting.  I loved the historical detail.  If Hitler was supposedly a man of the people, that did not include the decent people, those who bravely held on to their humanity.  Having suffered terribly in and after the Great War, the decent poor were the hardest hit by Hitler's foray into armed conflict with most of the rest of the world.  Death as the narrator was a brilliant device.  It was one of the ideas that survived the movie making process for good reason.  I completely recommend this book, but I warn you: clear your schedule.
 Such a well thought out and engaging look at the horrors of nazi Germany filtered through the adolescent years of a young German girl and narrated by Death. Tender but powerful.
 I read the book, then I saw the movie, and now I'm re-reading the book.  Great characters, great story, interesting format.
 I loved the book and how it was written.  It was rich and deep and caused me to reflect about death, war, and the human condition.  My only dislike was the epilogue  - it left me with so many unanswered questions.  I plan to go back to reread it to see if I will find the answers I am missing.  I  rated it 5 because it was one of the best books I have read in a long time.
 A well-written story told by an unconventional narrator! The style is also unique. I loved the film based on the book too!
 Amazing!
 This book is so touching. I loved every page. It was unlike any other WWII story I've ever heard. Warning: you will dirty cry at the end.
 This book is a must read for everyone.  My granddaughter and I happened to be reading this at the same time.  We both though it great.
 This was ordered for our book club discussion and it's nice that the questions are included in the back,  The quality paperback edition is nicely bound and easy to read.
 Creative writing of a love story set in one of the worst times of our history.
 I loved this book.  I sobbed throughout the entire ending.  Heavy subject matter, but so worth the read.  You won't regret reading this book.
 Fast shipping. Item just as described.
 Innovative and poignant. Holocaust books can be gut wrenching, but The Book Thief rises above the merely sad with grit and resilient voices.
 I liked "Death" as the narrator in this book.  I liked how the book made me think ...I liked the relationship between the young orphan and her adopted family and friends living on her street.  I liked reading about the kids and how they survived starvation during WW II from the German perspective.  I felt that Death had compassion-more than humanity.
 I usually read book after book; I start one right after I finish one. After finishing this book; however, it took me two days before I could start another. This is a page turner that is not easy to put down.
 I was recommended by a friend to read this book after I was explaining my mothers traits (who grew up in Germany during world war 2).<br/>I am finding this book very interesting to hear it from a Germans point of view. It has a slow start and once you understand the angle in which the book is written, you should enjoy it. If nothing else, it will help explain what they - the Germans - went through during that time.<br/>I am enjoying it immensely. Hope you do too.
 This is a book about World War II in Germany, told from the viewpoint of death and describing life for sympathizers, uncommitted and Jews.  The writing is poetic and unusual and the importance of the use of words is paramount.
 The book was much better then the movie.  Really kept your attention through the whole story.
 Amazing read! Beautiful, but heartbreaking story. I sobbed at the end.
 Wonderfully written...the narration was beautifully metaphorical and I wanted to highlight almost all of the bold print.  A different look at those who suffered during WWII
 I found this book amazing, I wanted to know where Death was taking the story. It made me wonder how the average German felt at the end of the war with Hitlers demise. Was there guilt over the treatment of Jews? Was there relief that the war and suffering was over? Was there anger and hatred because Hitler was defeated? Great story, I cried bucket loads when her adopted family and friends were killed in the sir raid.
 One of the finest books I ever read. I have purchased ten copies over the year. I give as gifts. superb.
 Wonderful book--lots of food for thought about the power of words!!  Just hope that the movie does it justice--as it does not always do this when the book is excellent.
 It was very interesting, the way it was written.  It was narated by death, or the angel of death.  It was also interesting because it presented a different view of WW II.
 Great story. I haven't seen the movie but I put this on my "want to read list" from back when they movie came out. It did not disappoint. Worth the read.
 Best book for adults as well as adolescents.  Made a great movie as well.<br/>Love the narrator, Mr. Death.
 Sometimes hard to follow who was narating the story and where each person began Otherwise very good  hope you enjoy the book also
 Very informative interesting story about nazi time. I bought it just because it was on y<br/>The bookshelves in bookstores every where but then I couldn't put it down.
 EXCELLENT BOOK, MUCH MORE IN IT THAN THE FILM, UNUSUALLY WRITTEN, WELL WORTH THE READ
 I love words. Never have I read anything that used words so precisely, each with its own weight. My heart and soul were fed. The tears remain.
 From the beginning I was hooked by this little girl, her family's struggles and loss.  How other people filled in her void, but she in turn was filling theirs!  Talented author!
 It took a little while to figure out the flow of the book (was also my first Kindle read), but once I did and got into the book, I didn't want to put it down. Although fictional, it brought a perspective on WWII (a child growing up in Nazi Germany) that is not often discussed and I really appreciated it for that.
 Loved it. Bought the movie too but read the book first. Nothing compares to the beauty and eloquence of words. This book is a treasure.
 the author's third person perspective worked very well, since the narrator was wonderfully unique. The characters were rich and the plot compelling.
 Well written and interestingly told story of a foster child in Nazi Germany.  Narrated by "death" but otherwise told from the perspective  of a young girl who learns very many tragic and graphic things about life but nevertheless finds herself despite challenging conditions able to embrace the kindness and love of those she finds around her.
 So much has been said about this book and it's all positive. One often hears about a book being "un-put-downable" - well, in the case of The Book Thief, this is not an exaggeration! It was my first book on Kindle and thank goodness it was - because I could read it under the bedcovers without complaints about "keeping the light on". From Saumensch, to "he with hair the colour of lemons", every character in the book came to life. What I liked most about this book was the fact that the plot describes the lives of ordinary - and very poor - Germans who didn't have any truck with people who were Jewish (or of any other denomination). They hated the war and just wanted to get on with their lives. The author tells the story from their viewpoint and evokes vivid images of people who themselves are just pawns in the Game of War. It was also chilling the way Death "narrates" the story. You almost feel sorry for the ol' Grim Reaper because he seems to be in a job he hates! I recommend this book highly - you won't be sorry you bought it!
 This is undoubtedly the best novel that I have read! The story is gripping and so very well-written. The reader is both plunged into a world of turmoil and yet strangely protected from it. The imagery in this novel is strikingly innocent and delightful. I have completed this novel with a heavy heart...a great sadness that I have come to the end.
 Very impressed and touched by this book. I had difficulty putting it down. Not a light read, but a mix filled with joy and sorrow.
 Good buy
 I'm in the middle of this book and I can't put it down.  I don't write reviews as my arthritic fingers don't keyboard (now using pointer finger).
 Bought this for my sister and she really, really liked it.
 I am the person who lives in their books. I become part of the books I read-- and this book is one of my favorites ever. I can't ever remember reading a book with not only incredible, soulful and colorful writing as this before but the words touched my heart. The personification of death was touching and irrevocable as well as "his" and my connection to the characters. Truly outstanding, heart breaking and addicting in the best and worst ways.
 I love this story. All the things going on with in the story are really life like story and I just could not put it down.
 Great book and better than I expected. Well worth the read! Definitely recommend this book to readers and a great story
 The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is an amazing book about a young girl trying to survive daily life in Nazi Germany.
 This was a very good read.  I felt like I was there.  I didn't want the story to end.  I rented the movie after I read the book and was very disappointed.  They left way too much detail out.  The book was so much better.
 Outstanding read! An incredibly written novel about WWII. I loved the literary style this book was written in. I am glad I read it before I saw the movie.
 I am captivated by a story from God.s point of view.<br/>Great story of the suffering of the German bystanders<br/>Man's inhumanity to man
 An excellent book particularly if you enjoy reading about WWII and Hitler's Germany.  It offers a totally different perspective when told through the eyes of a young girl, who saw the horrors of war and what happens to the innocent victims.
 I couldn't put this book down. Awesome book great writer. Read this book in two days.  Good read and very belivable story.
 This deep, romantic, and sad book will touch your soul. A memoir of a WWII survivor narrated by the character, death. A sweet, sad, read.
 Astonishingly good.  Original and completely engaging.
 Fabulous WWII story from the perspective of regular German people.  Narration by Death and his descriptions of color were quite enjoyable.
 This novel is purportedly for young adult readers; however I was captivated by it and have read it twice.
 This falls with the top 10 of my favorite books. A child with a heart filled with love for people and for words. It moved me to tears.
 Purchased for my gson....he reviewed the movie with me and wanted to read the book.  Appears he enjoyed both!  Money well spent in my book!
 Marcus is an incredible writer with bringing a story to me with a complex plot. Most unique and original. He sucked me into it.
 My first thought was that this was another "German Nazi"  horror story...It wasn't!<br/>  It was a story about a young girl's love of books and her relationship between  her and her adopted father, who taught her how to read, and the people she shared it with.  The time period at the very beginning was Germany's loss of control to Hitler.  I enjoyed the drawings that co-incided with the story line.
 I kept stealing moments away from regular life to read this book. I expect to be rereading it for a long, long time.
 Great!!!
 I'm not sure what age group the book was aimed at, but I liked the book.  The book showed that folks don't always have an easy choice as to which side they commit to. It brought out a side of Nazi Germany that may not be poplular in Germany.
 Amazing, enjoyable,  enjoyed this book througly! A great read.....
 This book is highly entertaining and beautifully written.  It kept my attention with a fast-moving plot and many interesting twists.
 I am very glad I took the time necessary to read this book. It is a classic that should be a requirement.
 One of my all-time favorite books!  Just amazing.  Arrived on time and in great shape.
 It is a touching and well written story... Full of sadness and hope to be sure but also full of symbolism and craft. Looking forward to reading it again and again.
 Have not read it yet.  Have however finished Sue Grffton's "W". As usual it was a gripping, great work.  I am an avid fan or Sue Grafton and have and read, (some more than once) all of her books.  Looking forward to X,Y, and Z and maybe "AA".
 I wanted to give it 5 stars, but I wasn't sure I was going to like it in the beginning. The story is told from the odd perspective of death. There is overuse of the words "saukerl" and "saumensch", but, overlook that and the story is simple and wonderful. I ended up really liking it. Expect some tears.  Good ending.
 THE BOOK THIEF is a wonderful read. I highly recommend it for teens and adults. The film carefully followed the book plot and is great also.
 This was a great deal and I see that it works great!  I will read this when I get to it.
 This book is an interesting read and written from a unique perspective.  It leaves the reader with questions because of its sense of intrigue.
 Stumbled upon this book and flew through it on vacation.  slow start but picked up. It was a reminder of the sadness that the world lived through before wwii
 Loved the story.  It was so powerful and it brought me to tears.  I couldn't hear the movie pieces that were inserted so I didn't really use those.
 Loved it.  What a wonderful story of a young girls challenges during WWII and how she survived and thrived.
 Intriguing story, creatively written...a different approach to telling a story. It's the best book I've read. heart warming and also heart breaking.
 A book so touching that it should be required reading in every school. A vivid reminder of a war that destroyed bodies and souls. You can smell the decay, death, regret and sadness. Time and time again you are reminded that artfully written or spoken words is the worlds greatest tool.
 I cannot begin to describe how impressed I was with this book!  Each chapter, whether long or short, was worthy of a time of reflection.  Beautiful about an ugly time.
 I just re-read this and loved this book even more the second time. Usually, I don't like to read something that I've already read, but this book and the movie - which had some modifications - are both excellent. The members of a new book club hadn't read it and I knew it was a Must Read. I went looking for more books from Markus Zusak.
 This book was so good, could hardly  put it down
 I really liked the point of view of this book, the narrator made things very interesting, it will cool to see how they use it in the upcoming movie!
 I really enjoyed this sad poignant book and would recommend it  I enjoyed reading this book better then the movie production of it
 A combination of emotions...happy, sad, funny...history being foremost. The story certainly stayed with me for days. Read it and love it!
 A hundred times more interesting than the movie. Very rich descriptions. You cannot read this and not fall in love with Himmel Street and it's eccentricities.
 Twists your insides and makes you reflect on the book long after you finished it. Beautifully written and characters that you just can't help but fall in love with.
 This novel was the second book I purchased for my Kindle - 2nd only to Owen Meany.  There are so many tales told about this horrific time in world history, but very few navigate it as poetically as Death.  What a poignant, tragic perspective.<br/><br/>One annoyance - the only option was the movie cover, not the original.
 I am an English teacher of 41 years and I wish I had read this book before I retired.  I would have required my students to read it!  The story is so incredibly beautiful and uniquely written from the narrator who witnesses all and shows such compassion.  I have several favorite books, and this one now ranks in my top books!! Bravo!!!
 With Death as the narrator, this was a bit of a different book...but it certainly held my interest.  Would recommend this book.
 Recommended to me by others and did not disappoint. The story of was told from a very unique perspective.
 Could not put this book down.  A page turned for sure!
 well written and very engaging - a very good read!
 Great book
 This book is just too good to pass up!  If you have seen the movie, you are missing too much of her story and the real goodness and grossness of humanity.  It makes you look inward.
 One of the best books I've read.  Opened my eyes to the evil and suffering that Hitler caused his own people.
 Very good after I got into it but slow at first.  Good story.
 Such colorful writing. This book was an absolute delight to read, even during the not-so-delightful parts. It was just beautiful and will stay with me for quite a while.
 It was an excellent book. I found the ending a little hard to understand who was the narrator. It was a sad ending but war is sad.
 Love this book. Narrated by death himself, Leisel's life on Himmel Street comes to life. Funny and heart breaking,  a true pleasure to read.
 I almost stopped reading just a few pages in. I'm so glad I didn't. What an amazing book -- so much told about humanity in mere words.
 Great book. Reading it a second time.
 Halfway through this book you couldn't have paid me a million dollars to finish it. But being the anal person I am, I had to see it through.  By the time I finished, I was planning when I could squeeze in some time to read it again! Characters that started out bland came to life, and the sorrow was not overwhelming, just overwhelmingly sad.
 I had a little difficulty with the narrator but became  engrossed in the characters that it was hard to put the book down. Must confess the movie helped a lot.
 I didn't find out til later that it was a child's book.it was excellent. I am 80years old
 The story kept my interest although it took a few chapters to adjust to the writing style. Lots of real human emotion we can all relate to!! Definitely touches your heart.
 I decided to read this book after seeing the movie trailers as I am fascinated by WWII. I quite enjoyed the story as it relates the experience of poor Germans and how many were trapped in a society not of there own making.
 I really liked this book.  I did not see the movie so I didn't know anything about it.  I enjoyed it and felt moved by it.
 Through the narrator, death, the reader gets a different perspective on the horrors of World War II in Germany, both for the Jews and for the German families who found themselves torn both emotionally and physically by the Fuhrer.
 A book whose characters and experiences will linger with you long after you have finished reading. Truly moving and heartfelt.
 5 stars. Amazing book.
 The Book Thief is an unconventional story, and it will slowly but surely ensnare you... It is truly superb. I entreat you to read it.
 I started the book and cannot get away from it. The style is a good different and the story is compelling. Read it and enjoy.
 Easy to get
 Great Story, writing takes time to get the meaning but worth the effort
 I have always wondered what to be a person. especially a child, in Germany during the war.  If you were not Jewish or Nazi what happened.  This book is a must read.  You will find out how hard it was to find food, clothes, shelter, safety, and keep out of prison or jail.  Super good book!!!
 very poignant story
 This book is a "must read".  The characters in the book are developed in such an interesting way.  It's a book that I wanted to keep on reading and yet at times I had to ponder the contents.  I belong to a book club and we will be discussing it soon.
 I really enjoyed this book even though the material is painful.  I like the odd perspective from "Death" and the little girl.  I recommend it highly. I didn't see the movie, so I can't speak to any comparisons.
 I was immediately drawn into this book by the action in the ER in the beginning . As a medical professional , I thought it was well done
 Can one say they enjoy reading about this atrocity?  The Book Thief is well written, from such a different perspective, of human suffering, friendship, the best of humanity, and the worst.  I would recommend this book to all so events don't repeat themselves.  It pushes me to be kinder, less judgmental, we are all one humanity...it drives me to try to make it better.
 A beautifully written book. What a treasure!
 Wonderful story. A must  read
 This book had amazing characters and messed with your emotions effortlessly. By far one of the greatest reads out there.
 At first the narrator seems out of place or even off putting but the payoff in the end is fabulous. If you are not moved by this story you have no heart. When death finally comes for me it hope I am sitting up. Read the book and you will understand.
 Excellent book! If you've seen the movie, the book will provide additional information that makes the story even more enjoyable.
 A book like no other. Such beauty, brilliance, and horror in the words. My mind was constantly filled with word painted pictures.
 Gripping story of Nazi Germany told from a child's point of view. Wonderful character development and dialogue. I couldnt put it down.
 Oh my goodness. We read this book in my English class and it immediately became one of my favorites.
 Beautiful book. A terrible time the history of the world. Life went on, with hardship, kindness and love amidst the pain and destruction. Words and the love of words leaps out on every page. I loved every minute of the book. It made me pause; it made me reflect; it made me cry.
 One of the best books I've read. The story keeps moving and I found myself backs to put the book down.
 Loved the book.  Characters were well written and very "real."  Interesting choice of narrators, but it really gave a whole new view to the casualties of war.  I would recommend it to anyone that likes personality in their book characters with a bit of history.
 I highly recommend this touching story.  It is sad but has its funny side as well.  I absolutely loved the characters.
 We saw the movie and then I had to read the book..I was not disappointed...I may read it again in 6 months..it was just that type of book.
 Loved how this book was written. The words leap off the pages and paint vivid pictures. You get swept in the emotion and can only wonder at the amazing resilience of the human spirit.
 Beautiful use of words and an interesting approach to the specter of death.  The look at civilian life during WWII was a provocative approach that gives a better understanding about their struggles.
 Wonderful book.  Great story.  Tells a lot about history while leaving you with hope for humanity.
 For students of WWII and Hitler's unfathomable cruelty...this is a touching story. I understand this book is now going to become a movie. Done right, no dry eyes. Really a good story.
 This very interesting book gives a true picture (I believe) of ordinary German people and their travails during World War II. The book is written from the point of view of death as one of the characters, which is a very interesting aspect. The large and varied cast of characters must all face him as they go about their remaining time.
 ...can describe this book. You have to read it, to feel it, to experience it.. to understand that it can't be described.
 I loved the book. I am always interested in this subject. It was well written and told such an interesting story. I must admit I did shed tears at the end.
 This was an awesome book. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction. Happy reading, folks!
 I was shocked by how much I enjoyed this book. Easy read and given from a unexpected point of view.
 Excellent book!  I was expecting something a little fluffier because its so popular, but was really surprised and impressed by how good this book was.  It has an interesting narrative structure that adds to great storytelling and fantastic character development.  I read a lot and this was one of my favorites, at least from the last few years.
 It was a unique book and from a unique perspective - death. This is not a spoiler, it is spelled out in the beginning. I felt a real kinship with the characters and didn't want the book to end. If you've seen the movie and liked it, which I did, the book supplies so much more detail. I saw the movie when I was only a third of the way through the book, but it made me want to get back to it to learn as much as I could about the characters. The book touches on the Holocaust, but it is mostly about the average German families and what they endured under Nazi rule. I had it downloaded to my Kindle and read it only while I used the treadmill. My sessions were quite long and frequent because I wanted to keep reading.
 This is a great read for Point of View, metaphors and style.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a well written story with an historical backdrop.
 I read the book in anticipation of seeing the movie. I was disappointed in both presentations. A very<br/>superficial coverage of a very horrible period of time in history. Reading was directed to a young audience<br/>that was based upon a child's narration of serious events during the Nazis control of Germany, The movie<br/>was a good version of the book and therefore, produced the same reaction. On the other hand, our movie<br/>group enjoyed the movie and thought the picture was a winner. From my usual pattern of reading primarily<br/>non-fiction books, I would not normally have selected this book. True, the book addressed a non-fiction<br/>topic but it was a little too Orphan Annie for me.
 Very engrossing story and beautifully written. Couldn't put it down, even after seeing the film. It just captures you and draws you in.
 The book is amazing and spell bounding. I couldn't put it down and when I finally came to the end of the book I wanted more. This story and it's characters will follow you, even after finishing the book. I would recommend this book to anyone and have already lent my copy (something I never do with my books) to someone I know and I'm very much looking forward to discussions on the book.
 I loved this book. The fact that the story is being told by the "Grim Reaper" made me know ahead of time that there was probably going to be sad parts, but it was told in such an uplifting way. Would definitely recommend this book
 One of the best books I have read lately.  Very good story, and interesting enough to keep you wanting to turn the page for more.
 I enjoyed reading this book to the fullest. It is funny, heart-wrenching, and interestingly written. I would teach this book to my students in a heartbeat.
 The story of a young girl in Nazi Germany is a textured and interesting story... What make sthe book very appealing to me is the economy of language... for the author every word seems to be chosen and none wasted... the fun of the language is the way the author often uses words in an unusua and original way. It's like eating specially prepared carrots - savoring each - one by one ...with none wasted.
 It was very good from beginning to end.  It makes you realize how lucky we are to live in the United States.  I can't imagine how I could cope with all that she had to handle.
 Amazing story, beautifully told.  Disturbing to read about Nazi Germany through a child's eyes.  I would highly recommend this book.  It's written in a lyrical style.  I'm not sure this book is written for children unless maybe they are highschool age.
 I read a lot - if I'm not in the middle of a book at all  times, I get twitchy; but even so, I'm ready for most books to wrap up and end.  This is a story I was hoping wouldn't end.  In fact I was so bummed when it did that I got seriously teary.  I still have trouble believing it did!  More, Dude!
 This is the only book to ever make me actually cry. Such a beautiful story. I loved how it was told from a unique point of view. Everyone should read this.
 Very well written. Would recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction.
 It took me a little while to get used to the narrating style, which I didn't like too much at the start. It was fitting for the story nonetheless and truly enjoyed it. The element I liked most was how children deal/process with right and wrong in a period of distorted ideals.
 This is a book that will stay with you for a lifetime. Oddly written, relentlessly engaging. Hard to pick up and impossible to put down. I have never read anything like it and I am not sure I would like to again.
 I read the book because I saw the movie and I didn't understand the last part if she married Max. I still don't know if she did or not.<br/>I'm disappointed with the ending. I enjoyed the book up until the end. I don't think I would read any more of the authors books thinking<br/>it might end with an ending wondering what happened.
 I enjoyed the book.  It gave some insight into the life of the German poor during WWII and those who did not agree with the<br/>Natzi. The unusual use of death as the narrator was a very different way to tell the story.
 Compelling read that pulls you into a distant time and gives poignant insight into what it was to be a Jew or a German during this time.
 Well written with good story telling. The narrator twist provided a depth of perception that was both surprising and enlightening. The timelines got confusing in parts, and some of the instances chosen for translating German was mystifying, but overall very entertaining. People do amazing things in all sorts of situations. There is beauty present in even the utmost despair.
 I am not familiar with this book, but my daughter had seen the movie and said that it was excellent.  I bought the book as a gift for one of my granddaughters as she enjoys reading about other cultures.
 Excellent !!!! A point of view u won't expect!
 Interesting reading for the assignment required.
 Almost childlike, Delicate in the storytelling. And desperately sad. The book thief had an almost Anne Frank's diary quality to it - but from the perspective of a young girl trapped in Hitler's Germany, forced to participate in the regime - and seeking small ways to rebel.
 Well-written and very interesting. It made me stop and think. It was a book I had to stop and put down every few chapters, in order to process the events that were happening. My Grandfather fought in Germany in WWII, so there were so many parts of this book that made me wonder what he went through and saw in his experience there. I highly recommend this book!!
 We read this book for an all girls high school book club. Everyone loved it! It was powerfully written with deep sentiment and beautiful language.
 Read the book BEFORE I saw the movie and was not disappointed by either one. Recommended reading.
 Wife is reading it now, and likes it.
 I appreciate the way the author gave me a new point of view of this tragic time in history.<br/>"Death" made an excellent narrator.
 Sort of depressing, but realistic characters. Feel for them and their situations.
 i'm not finished with this book yet, but almost there...it is an amazing read. love the historical aspects (and i'm not one who normally gravitates to these types of stories) and the characters feel so real and relatable. i highly recommend it!
 AAA+++
 Was a bit of a hard starter until I understood who the narrator actually was.  Thought it odd but then fell into the book completely.
 The length of the book was daunting &amp; the narration of a mixture of stories, tiring @ times but somehow the time was well-spent &amp; the thinking generated makes me want to contribute more in my lifetime.
 Well written and great story
 at first the way of telling pusseld me but once used to it, this is a wonderful book, it has both fun, sadness, poetry and tradgedy.
 I'm still reading this book, but so far (about 1/3 through), I am enjoying the book thoroughly.  Took me a couple pages to realize who the narrator of the book was....Living in Germany during WWII in a small town is an interesting take on an old story.
 Lived the tale, laughed &amp; cried...was refreshing to read a book that I connected with after what felt like forever
 This was a very good book and hard to put down. It was also so very sad, but gives an insight of what it was like to live in Europe during ww2.
 I can't think of enough good words to describe this extraordinary book.<br/><br/>I am going to remember it and be touched by it for the rest of my life.
 I would get lost sometimes in the story with the third person.  there may not have been one but I didn't understand it any other w a y.  I really appreciated the relationship between liesal and her papa also Mrs Hermann the mayor's wife.  I wish it materialized a little further especially after foster parents were killed.  also would have liked a little more about max and her after the release from concentration camp.  over all a good read.
 Written in the voice of Death, this book takes a little bit of getting used to. Very enjoyable and well written. Would recommend.
 Written so beautifully. It made you see things differently!!! I highly recommend this book. You will NOT regret reading this book!!
 It was an electrifying story of tragedy and triumph painstakingly written by a very sympathetic author.  I had trouble putting it down.
 Though I have read many books about World War II, this book shed light on the good people that had to endure much to help others. It helped me have more faith in humanity. It reminded me that there must have been many, many people that did not believe in the Nazi's idiocy.
 A beautiful story from a unique perspective that held fast my attention.  The book thief, albeit sad at times, was a joy to read.
 Couldn't put the book down and love that it's from Death's point of view.
 The imagery and language in this book are unexpected and engrossing. I found the writing as engrossing as the plot.
 My feelings on the book thief: moving, emotional, uplifting, horrifying, loving, hateful, and these are just some of them! What a powerhouse!,
 This book was wonderful.  The movie followed the book.  Glad I saw the movie first or I would have cried during the last 100pages.
 All I can say is Wow! I don't even have words that would live up to the author's use of them. This book was written with such thought and care and vision that I would not have changed a word of it. This author is one of the BEST word shakers I have never met. I just don't understand the reasoning behind it being classified as Young Adult Literature. I almost didn't read it for that very reason. I am glad I got past that labeling and added it to my book club's list. I can't wait to discuss it! Note: I am highly critical
 Slow starting as I figured out what was going on. However  as I got deeper in to it, I found It was so interesting I couldn't put it down.  It is a very good book by an author I had never heard of before. Can't wait to try his next book.  But for THE BOOK THIEF you will need a box of kleenex  by your side  at the end
 Saw the movie, then read the book!  Both were excellent!
 This book is a beautiful story told by Death of a young girl in Germany during WWII. I fell in love with each of the characters, including the narrator who gently carries souls away.
 Unique writing style!  I love books set during World War II.  This is an interesting story; the only drawback for me was the occasional vulgar expressions.  Worth the time!
 The story is about getting thru some horrible times in world
 A friend recommended this book and after all the favorable publicity, I decided to give it a try. It's not at all what I thought it would be. The writing is unique and good, but not my style.
 I love the way this book is written.  So many perspectives! I was transported in time. You can almost feel the dust on your face
 I've always loved The Book Theif, I read it in suxth grade snd decided to reread it cuz of the movie. It has links ti videos that are amazing!!!
 Wonderful, profound story.  Markus Zusak use of words really touched me deeply.I loved his ability to paint with his use of words.
 When my mother died I inherited her kindle. This was the last book she started and she would have loved it. I finished it for her. The story of one person living through the time and place they are given would have delighted her. This was how she saw all of us. Each living our lives within a continuum of humanity. Each story as rich and meaningful as another. Thank you, Mr Susan for this gift.
 The Book Thief was an outstanding reading of a talented young girl who had so much misfortune. In times of war she found some sort of happiness with a soccer ball, a friend, and books that she would acquire. Her survival was such amazing with all the tragedies that a terrible war will being. Truly, a book that one should read!!
 At times this book was a bit of a downer but it had a lot of twists you did not always expect. Some history involved. I liked and disliked it both at times.
 This book started out a little difficult to figure out, but once I understood who the narrator was I found the story riveting and I came to love and admire the characters.  It does a good job of making a difficult and dark subject understandable and meaningful, while giving a sense of hope.  The reader needs to persevere through the first part but will ultimately be rewarded with a great story.
 This book is written like no other book I have ever read. The author did a fantastic job. As you read, you might get a little confused, as I did, but keep reading for it all comes together. Great book, captivating story.
 Loved it
 Outstanding book .. Well written and now I look forward to the movie.  Best book of the summer and one I will highly recommend.
 I could read this book a million times!
 Narrated by death, this novel explores the depths of the human soul. What does it mean to be human? To do right vs wrong. I could not put this book down!
 This is a very touching and engaging story.
 I was recommended this book and now I extend that recommendation. I am not good at writing reviews so I'll just leave it at it is a lovely storey that is worthwhile.
 This is  one of those books I want to read again. It's thought provoking -- it makes me examine myself and ask of myself what I stand for.
 The first chapter was a bit tough to get through, and a little odd.  But I'm so glad I stuck it out because the story ending up being loving and sweet, horrifying and gruesome all at the same time.  A new favorite that I will recommend to anyone.  Just get through the first chapter and it will all make sense.
 This book changed my life. There are no words to accurately and completely describe the absolute brilliance of this book. This book is powerful, and carries a powerful message. It will stay with you for a very very long time, long after it is read. This is one of those books I want to throw in everyone's face and force them to read. Be prepared for tears, and love, and a beautifully broken heart.
 So much has been written here about this magical book, but I wish to add to the long list of those that feel that The Book Thief is a wonderful experience for you and shows WWII Nazi Germany from an entirely different perspective. Liesel and Rudy are childhood friends and neighbors, best of friends really, that live in a small suburb of Munich. Their exploits during the war are told in a story so delicately and beautifully written that it was a pleasure to pick up, and hard to lay down each evening at bedtime. I imagine that this is how life must have been for many families in Germany during these difficult years.<br/><br/>I loved this book and am thankful that I experienced the gifts of Mr. Zusak.
 The lost innocence of children during a horrible time in Germany's history is depicted very well in this story.  The bravery of this little girl and her relationships with the people in this story are heartwarming and a testament to her strong will to survive.
 This is a beautifully written book. I could not put in down and never wanted it to end. While many of Markus Zusak's books are for children, The Book Thief is very much for mature readers based on an horrendous time in 20th history we must never forget or forgive.
 It was a great read. I did bounce around a lot, with the future past and present but it all plays out in the end. Very well written.
 Absolutely outstanding characters during a very disturbing time in history.
 It is a very good book and it's written in an usual way. I greatly recommend it, I also saw the film and liked it very much, too.
 I enjoyed it. It is something that caters to personal taste.
 Great book, highly recommend!
 I liked the book, and it was a good story, I like the narrator's perspective used, as it just is a little different point of view, to add variety.  The book seemed to get more interesting after about 50% through, as it is somewhat type of fictional biography type, and you follow the character as she grows up.
 I can't get into the book.  It is weird.  I heard the movie was awesome but I'm having a problem understanding what is going on - at least at the first of it anyway.
 ..I  ordered the enhanced version by mistake and couldn't take advantage of of video etc. but I do highly recommend this book..
 I'm so glad I bought this book for my kindle. I also bought a hard copy for my mother. So sorry this kind of thing happened to all the people.
 Midway through Zusak's book, at dinner with friends, I mention what I'm reading. I quickly learn that it's regularly assigned by educators for the Tween and Teen students.  No matter, this just turned 61 year-old was "grabbed by the ankles from page one to the end.  This is only the second novel I've finished feeling deeply cheated that it would not go on.
 Markus Zusak writing is like poetry.  It's insightful, thoughtful and beautiful.  Even if the story wasn't that good his writing is worth reading, but the story is amazing.  You feel these characters and become attached to them.  The Book Thief is a wonderful read.
 Beautifully written and captivating story of a friendship between a young boy and girl in war-torn Nazi Germany. Creative writing at its best! Highly recommended.
 Read this book.  It is wonderful, beautiful and totally absorbing. One of the best!  Skip the movie.  It leaves out the best parts!!
 Bought this book as I loved the movie...didn't finish -yet
 Nice story
 This is a very fine book that has an intriguing voice in that the storyteller is Death. Powerful and emotive prose that often becomes almost poetic. Also because it is written about the fortitude, horror, sadness and salvation of an ordinary German family during WWII this is an uncommon theme for English readers. Highly recommended.
 Very well written; surprising and unique approach. I will definitely see the movie when it comes out. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about the holocaust &amp; how people were able to survive it.
 This was one of those books that you can not put down.  Do not let the length of the book stop you from reading it.  I read for enjoyment and The Book Thief will give you many moments to stop and think.  Even in the worst of times the pages of a book can bring joy.  "A book is a present you can open again and again."
 In reading books of WWII, I need to be reminded that all parties involved in war-torn Germany suffered a loss of freedom. Of course, the amount differed, but the negative impact was felt by all.
 I enjoyed this book.  It was much better than the movie which I saw later.
 Read this in one day. Rather small book but very good.  Keeps reader involved. I  would recommend for short read.
 A heartwarming tale of ordinary people doing extraordinary things for others, words to live by for a better world in the future.
 I saw the movie, and then I read the book. People told me not to bother, but if I had not, I would have missed out on a gem. This book is fun, sad, full of great characters, and everything else you could possibly want out of a book. You will cheat yourself if you do not invest the time it will take you to get to know these characters.
 This book is written in a unique perspective. It takes you through one girls ups &amp; downs in life in a very memorable, hard time in this world.
 I loved this book.  Having death serve as the narrator totally sets this story a part.  I cried my way through the ending.  You learn another perspective on World War II and you will be moved.  Great read.
 The words and images created in this book are an artful masterpiece! Such beautiful writing, truly unique and wonderfully colorful
 My husband wanted to start up a book club and chose this book. I was a little worried about it because we have totally different tastes in books but I completely fell in love! An easy read but very sweet, entertaining, and emotional. We spent our anniversary watching the movie in theatres!
 I loved this book. Having lived in Germany as a military wife, I understood so much of what was happening. The author explained the things that could be confusing,made the story easy to follow. Held my attention to the end----didn't want to put it down. todays generation could understand how hard life was in that time and maybe know that there are still people that live that way now. Loed this book.
 Death watching life. Love it. Great story, wonderful characters.  I highly recommend putting it on your reading list!
 This was a choice by my book club which is why I ordered it. It arrived promply. It was certainly a different type of book and I am glad I read it. Overall my book club like it also.
 Writers especially should have this on their bookshelves for reference of how it's done. Great way to present a very heavy topic.
 Great read. Strong language. Story of a little girl growing up in a foster home in Nazi Germany during the war.They are poor and book burning common yet the girl learns to read and love books, a forbidden possession. Oh yeah it's narrated by Death who extremely busy during the war takes special interest in the little Book Thief.
 Having the shadow of death around is a very different feeling. The perspective of a young girl who is not jewish , during Hitlers reign is refreshing to see. Enjoyed it , would like my granddaughter to read it too, so we can discuss it!
 Very good story line with historic events woven through the tale.  Well written and very much worth a read.
 Interesting to read about Germans who were not very involved in the war (until later). And those who would save the Jews. Also about love and caring.
 This book is interesting and thought provoking.  It is a different perspective of WWII and surprises the reader with unexpected characters.  This is a book I definitely will recommend.
 I really enjoyed the characters in this book and the way they interacted.  What a difficult time to live their lives
 This is an outstanding read for any age group.
 Intriguing read. page turner. In places, it is startlingly gentle in the midst of harsh circumstances.  Would recommend this book.
 This book should be read by anyone who has a heart.  It may be hurt in the reading but it will become more whole and pure as a result.
 I enjoyed reading this book. It's hard to imagine life in the midst of ww2. It's hard to imagine the horrors during this period. My own parents grew up during this time. This book brings to life an era that I am glad is dead.
 I really enjoyed "The Book Thief"...have always had an interest in the time period it takes place. Would recommend to all!
 The book came in great condition.  I ordered it for my daughter's Easter basket.  She is still working on another series.  She will be reading this one soon.
 When I began this book I wasn't sure I would continue reading it.  The style was a bit off-putting but as I continued it grabbed me and I truly could not put it down.  The writing style became part of the story which turned out to be as good of a multi-layered novel as you'll ever read.  The WWII material appeared to be well researched and really put me "in Berlin" at that time.  A fan of historical novels will like this.
 I can't believe I hadn't read this sooner. So good. Beyond good. I like reading books about WW 2. This is one of the best.
 One can't like that time of history, but one can learn even more about it.  It was a hard book for me to read. Too many images.
 One of the best books I have read in 2013. Wonderful story about the worst of times. It bolstered my belief  in innate humanity of some humans. There will always be a few with a true moral compass that guides their hearts and actions even in a place of utter depravity and horror.
 I loved this book. It broke my heart like only a great book can. I will be thinking of these characters for a long time.
 I raced through the book; couldn't put it down. Then I re-read it more slowly, savoring the hints the author sprinkles throughout that I missed the first time. A gorgeous story!
 Felt like I learned a lot about the 2nd world war and also about death as the book is narrated by death!  Sounds strange but with a quirky sense of humour, it makes you think slightly differently about life and death in general.  A good story, I am pleased a friend recommended the book as one of her all time faves.  Enjoy
 Beautiful, Moving, Meaningful.  Characters are well written and all very human.  One of the best books I've read in a long time.
 This is a great read from beginning to end.  A wonderful story along with history of the early wars.  I am telling everyone to read it.
