Love it! Wish would of bought years ago.
Fire hazard / dust collector / noise machine
Good, but could be better.
Recommended for sure! Good airflow and sleek design.
Not a 5 star product
Works Much Better in Circulating the Air!
Don't expect a lot of wind, but it is a safe option.
Lots of wind where you want it and when you need it.
and it is the right height (perfect for keeping you cool while you sleep)

Perfect so far!
Good size for large spaces and rooms.  Very large for smaller rooms.  No problems with noise

Certainly not one of the louder fans, but it's not quiet.  Noise is fine; a perceivable pitch isn't

Fan works great, controls are easy and remote works from across the room. Can't ask for much more than that.

It puts me to sleep

This fan is amazing!
Saved me from our sweltering heat wave here in California, I could actually sleep with no complaints!
Great for hot sleepers!

Amazing fan - sleeping better : )
Helps cool off bedroom 5 degrees cooler than normal
You practically have to turn dyson to level 7-8 because the speed of blowing air is too less and you still have to keep the fan
Good fan, bad remote
