Amazon not honoring "no questions asked" replacement warranty -- again.
Warranty is not easy!
Replacing this is VERY much a hassle
Worked great until it didn't.  Warranty not honored.  Filed with BBB.
BUYER BEWARE.
6 months of use, and I say it’s a fail.... F+
Total ripoff
Very slow, and design is awful
A Little Explanation on What the Tablet Is
The low price isn't worth the headache.
Replacements - No Questions Asked is A Joke
This Kindle works great when you have it
Please read before purchasing. As I wish there was a comment like this when I had bought these tablets.
You can control what kids download and view in the tablet.
Toddler tested, toddler approved!
Too slow for price, and limited to amazon
Not as advertised: You CANNOT download videos on FreeTime
Parents with young kids - this is worth it
Cannot recommend, tablet did not work at all.
Toddler Tested, Toddler Approved. Mom....not so much.
" 2-year worry-free guarantee: if they break it, return it and we'll replace it for free. No questions asked. "  B S
Kids love them
Automatic Downloads and no way to stop them.
This thing sucks! It constantly has problems
Operates like a very early generation electronic
I was excited to receive this device for our two ...
Perfect for your young kid
Requires credit card information to get through set up-2 months later doesn't charge
Mine stopped charging
Safe and kid friendly
AMAZON TABLET IS COMPLETE TRASH
This is a bug that can easily be fixed
Just Okay
Some people do not understand how the warranty works
Parental Controls don't work.
One happy Princess
Battery Will Stop Taking Charge - But Warranty is Great!
We tried to fall in love...
Junk, nothing but glitches
Nice. I'm also a prime member but unfortunately the ...
Utter crap RIP OFF design.
Surprisingly bad user interface.
Worst Tablets Ever
Fantastic way to help children with Autism get interested in technology
Don't buy this for your kid!
Great tablets for kids. 2yr warranty was easy to redeem
Get something better
They are absolutely terrible and I am going to sell them and get ...
They seemed like a great deal- But It really isn't.
This thing is awesome
Updated Review Buyer Beware Not worth the headache---Good Tablet for kids BUT the "no questions asked" is a JOKE
New Updates Greatly Diminished the Kid's Fire Experience
An ABSOLUTE LIE of device functions. You can't play downloaded prime video for your kid in Free Time.
Great gift for 12yr old girl
Tablet is great. The OS is not.
Not worth it if you have no internet
Fine as a cheap tablet...Freetime STINKS
Also like the fact that it came with the 2yr protection ...
I hate Apple and I’m telling you, just get an iPad.
Excellent Warranty!
Crack for babies!!!
Why does it have to be so difficult to use?
Hardware itself seems good. Content for young children is hit or miss, mostly miss. Beware of adult ads in some apps.
I hate these with the fire of 1000 suns.
My son loves this tablet and everything that is on it. He's got all of his favorite things right at his fingertips!
Great intro to the digital world for kids.
Pink, Blue and Yellow Tablet interface differences
I bought three of these for my three young boys ...
Has some account management headache, but kids love it to pieces.
My opinion on this tablet
This is junk. Spend the extra $120 to get a refurbished iPad Mini.
The ONLY tablet I recommend to parents!
Don’t buy unless you like wasting your money!!!!
Rejected by four-year-old granddaughter
We love Amazon Kids Tablets!
Poor performance, and buggy/ unreliable
Poor impression
Not what we expected
Works "okay"...WORST POWER PLUG EVER!! Don't Recommend.
Low battery life
5 months later no longer charges
Good at first now 11 months later I REGRET spending money on this tablet
Cheapest good tablet on the market
UPDATED REVIEW. ADULT CONTENT ON DEVICE!
Had to edit my review AGAIN!
Not what I expected
great for kids (while still having access to unlimited content) but overall not a great tablet
decepcionada!
Overtly Advertises to Kids, with no way to Disable it - Otherwise, it's just another Kindle with a cover
A terrific bargain
Owned for 2 months for 3 boys
Same as others; charging port fails after a few months, and repair procedure is a pain
You do need Amazon Prime to see the videos
Don't let your toddler watch YouTube kids get them a kindle.
Gets the job done but that's it.
I enjoy how easy the parental controls are
Not ready for prime time
Complicated, Frustrating, Not Worth It
Not great as a tablet for adults, but may be fine for young kids
Low and slow. In the worst ways. And confusing.
Kids like them, but they're a hassle
Wut
You can't watch the thousands of videos
Not the greatest for travel...
100% recommend this tablet for kids 8 and under
Warranty policy and charging capacity
Don't buy this from Amazon
Stopped working 6 months in... w/ update
Apple product owners: Beware!
Good!! But downloading and operating system is SLOW!
Just what we needed!
Needs better control and only useful with internet/wifi.
Amazing customer service and awesome return policy!
Do not waste your money
5 year old loves it.
Best tablet for toddlers and great warranty!
stay away
Best Kids Tablets Around
DEFINITELY READ THIS BEFORE BUYING!! You get so much more than you pay for!
When the time comes, not sure i would buy a kindle again.......
Decent tablet. Great warranty. Censored Android experience. Buyer beware.
-Durable, Simple, cheap. Weak battery life, eventually becomes extremely slow.
A good kid's tablet with an awful WiFi sign-on flaw
Its slow, it turns off on its own, and its hard to customize to your child's favorite shows or apps.
Its a great kids tablet hands down. But...
Perfect tablet for young kiddos
No Reliable Filters for Stopping Children's Purchases
Love hate relationship
So far so good. This is our 8th tablet purchase
all the games and movies are free <3
International Customers Beware
The replacement saga
I used to Love it :(
Maybe it’s a defective device?
So Happy I Bought this
Great upgrade choice for 5 year old, LOVE the parental controls!
Kid likes, parents don't
Mixed emotions about this product
do NOT recommend
Don't bother
Very aggravating and LOTS of bugs
Best decision 😊
Great!
Charging port breaks & difficult to use.
He seems to love it. My only complaint is that I didn't ...
The case is great and the few times my youngest
Not great. No good way to restrict access to a few apps in FreeTime. Lots of crashes and lag.
Great device....bad Amazon did not have one-year service included set up on device.
Your kids will use it so much the power port will break.
My kid loves this easy to use, tough little tablet, and I love how cheap it was.
It's "OK"
Terrible Tablet NOT WORTH IT!
customer services is STUBBORN
plug comes loose
Great tablet, but kids can't access Google apps or YouTube Kids from the kid profile/account
It's easy for kids to understand
Frustrating and deletes stuff
Three year old son loves this thing!
Without Kindle Free Time the device is not very functional for kids
Poor quality!
Horrible Product. Where do I begin?
SCAM BEWARE !!
We love the Kids Pack --- getting more
Kindle stopped working correctly
It's a complete rip-off but it's the only tablet that has a two-year warranty and not so expensive
The logic of app vetting/anti-competition
Don`t waste your money
Swapped this out for a regular one!
1st tablet for pre-schooler
Easy to use, light-weight, fun to play on
Great idea, some cons
Used to be Awesome, and then not so much; thankfully there is a warranty ...

Great investment!
When they say they will replace it if it breaks, they are lying.
The software is garbage
FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS...DON'T BUY THIS MODEL!!!
(EXPERIENCED) COMPARED TO OTHER KID FRIENDLY TABLETS...AMAZON ALL THE WAY HANDS DOWN!
Set up is not intuitive

Battery defects, can’t play without WiFi
Sturdy, Parental controls
Honest review
Works for Kids and Parents
Really want to love it
Good for help your child to excel with reading!
Amazon is the BEST
Abismal Battery Life...
Changes are not always a good thing.
A bait-and-switch. Stopped working after a week.
okay, not great
The lack of memory is truly frustrating
Great tablet... while it charged
Sound quality poor.
Great controls to make the device suitable for younger kids.  And the case is rugged and easy to hold on to for slippery fingers
Good budget tablet, solid 2 year unconditional warranty, but hardware and content is sorely lacking.
Great tablet for the cost!
Beware, it will break before the yr is over. BUY WARRANTY!!!
Great Tablet and Customer Service
Toddler loves it
USB charge port doesn't charge anymore
Save your money
Not as user friendly as I thot it could be.
You Get What You Pay For
This is the best kid tablet on the market in this price range
Don't feel guilty about giving children this tablet
SLOW!!!!
... be 2 in less than 2 months and she love it!
Poor quality, child profile unusable.
Stable! Great price! Great buy!
I was extremely disappointed in Amazon
Kids approved Parent approved
Worry-free guarantee is a load of crap
Beats any other kid tablet hands down!
It’s not childproof and not worth the money
A very good investment.
Perfect for the whole family!
Support and "worry free" Warranty = TERRIBLE experience
Guaranteed to have to return within a year
Perfect for a 1 year old
I bought this for my son plus I like that if my son broke it we can just ...
Not a tablet that lets your kids choose anything.
AMAZON LIES DO NOT BUY

Toddler loves it but I don't
I wanted to love this tablet for my daughter

That is not a 1 Star rating it is a Negative 4 Star rating.
Awesome Amazon! However the issue wasn't the charger
Terrible charging port
Welp
I had no issues getting replacement for battery port fail.

Great Tablet
Frustrating UI by childless developers.
Kids Edition Kindle Fire
Slow, buggy, and not durable... but an update regarding the excellent customer service
I should have know "no questions asked" was too good to be true.
Disappointment.
Great for big and little kids alike.
Replacement plan requires return of original first....
I bought the deal for 2 at 150$
Pros and cons

BEWARE- Sent with old software, can't be updated!!!
Purchased 2 - neither will charge after two months.
Faulty chargeport on tablet
Kindle fire 7"
Arrived with software so old we had to spend 3 hours updating it
Only good if you want to set the child's age and then send them on their way.
Confusing...
Needs more improvement to Amazon FreeTime
3 Fire Tablets - Charging ports failed on all 3 - several days out of warranty, Amazon will not fix
Great Tablet for Kids

Charger port WILL fail. Will be a complete hassle to used the "No Questions asked" return

Mediocre Tablet in a kids proof case
If you have multiple kids, read this first
A perfect child’s tablet.

Don't waste your money
Not a great product
Extremely slow
Good, but not great, being a kids item, this should come with a screen protector
One for each kid, so no more fighting!
The only thing I dislike is the ad feature
tablet is durable, the case is great for protection, ,and it's made great for small children.
Great tablet for kids
The sturdiness to these tablets is the best feature. The thick foam style case is amazing
Device is Great - but Pay Attention to Settings
Buy another tablet
Great Tablet for Kids
Nice tablet, may come with headaches if you already have subscription
The case takes the cake!
Not great for kids
Amazing tablet
Sooo slow, TOTALLY not worth it.
Camera is great for young ones to learn photography.
Won't charge, had it for a year and worked well until now.
what a piece of junk
Get one! Its worth every dime!
Love kindle. Battery life much shorter than advertised.
The battery lasts longer on airplane mode but not all the apps are available
No warranty
Slow
Nice Christmas present BUT!!!
Excellent tool for a growing child who loves to read
Just buy it, you will love it!!
Perfect tablet for kids!
charging port issues
Do not waste your money
Not very happy with this product
Best tablet for babies and kids
We thought this would be a great way to keep her hands off mommy's phone
no questions axed, my a$$
Only 6 Months and It's Dead...
DO YOUR RESEARCH! Things aren't as great as they sound!
Not user friendly. Not much storage. Not very kid friendly.
Great at first... But still ok!
So easy a 2 year old can use it!! (Set up in minutes)
Don't waste your money!
Great product
GREAT Investment
Everything your kid touches gets downloaded!
Great kids tablet
Freetime app is a must have for families!
"No questions asked" should be changed to "Lots of questions and run around"
It definitely was NOT NO questions asked and was NOT easy to get replaced
Battery wouldn’t charge.
I still have time to return them for yet another replacement but I figured what’s the use.
Beware, youll have to purchase more than one of these despite the warranty.
It's OK
Excellent.
Exceeded my expectations
Awesome tablet
