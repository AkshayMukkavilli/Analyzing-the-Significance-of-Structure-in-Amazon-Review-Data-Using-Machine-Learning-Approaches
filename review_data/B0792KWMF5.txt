 Some of the reviews had me worried due to people saying putting this bad boy together was a pain. I am a barely functioning human being. If it involves me having to use a screwdriver, we're going to be in for an adventure. I was able to assemble this within 15 minutes AND without crying. It is extremely easy to put together. There are all of 4 steps.<br/><br/>NOW onto reviewing how well it works.<br/>I live in Louisiana. Not only is the temperature around what the fiery pits of Hell must be like. But there is also humidity to add even more fun to it. I come home to a house that is roughly around 84 degrees F at 5:30 in the evening so I needed a little help with cooling off. Within 5 minutes of turning this thing on it was like an angel had come down from heaven and began to personally blow cool air on my face. I was genuinely close to tears. If this thing only lasts a month it will have been worth the money. Also people keep mentioning the light being bright at night. It's a little bitty green light the size of a pen top, not a laser beam.
 The Lasko 42" Wind Curve (wih ionizer) is a very good fan and is powerful enough for 20 x 20 foot room. The tall height works well in a bedroom where one might need to feel the breeze a bit higher while laying on a high mattress. You can also adjust the top portion of the vent up or down for your needs. The remote is handy for just such an occasion as well. The Lasko was very quiet despite its powerful breeze. The base is sturdy and I have experienced no rattling.<br/><br/>I compared the Lasko fan to the Holmes 32" Oscillating Tower Fan and there was no comparison. The Holmes fan was too short to generate a breeze above my bed where I needed it. The power of the fan was also extremely weak in general--especially since it was being advertised as a whole house fan. Essentially, Holme's most powerful breeze was equivalent to the lowest setting on the Lasko. The interface was confusing. And there also was no remote. The Holmes base is sturdy and I experienced no rattling.<br/><br/>I also compared the Lasko to the Sunter 40" Tower Fan (2 Pack Combo with a 13" Personal Fan). While I preferred the look of the Lasko (the silver color made it more versatile for both dark and light color themes), the truth is, of all three, the Sunter was the most powerful--though maybe only a step above. The 40" height was still high enough to reach over the bed where I needed it. Its top portion of the vent is not adjustable up-and-down like the Lasko--but most fans don't have that feature. The Sunter was fairly quiet, but not as quiet as the Lasko. The remote appears chintzier than the Lasko's but it turns out Sunter's remote range is stronger than the Lasko's. The Sunter base is sturdy and I experienced no rattling. However, I did experience vibration and rattling with its bonus personal 13" fan that came with it.<br/><br/>Of all three fans, the Lasko was the easiest to assemble. I felt the Lasko was the most attractively versatile with its silver finish. Both the Lasko and Sunter have an easy interface to understand. Both were sturdy and did not rattle. The Lasko has the quietest breeze, with the Sunter a close quiet second. However, the Sunter offered the strongest breeze, with Lasko being a close second. Both were good for 20 x 20' rooms. The Lasko offers three speed settings; the Sunter offers four speed settings. Both offer timers. The Lasko offers an ionizer feature which is nice; however, the Sunter offers an interesting evening breeze feature. (The evening breeze feature tapers off the breeze to the next lowest level every half an hour as you drift off to sleep--VERY nice.)<br/><br/>Finally,  at the time of this review] the Lasko costs $56.52 on Amazon; while the Sunter costs $39.99 at Costco (or $44.32 on Amazon). The $16 higher price for the Lasko dramatically altered my star rating for the product down to a 4-star. And since the Sunter is fairly comparable (with a bonus fan) at a dramatically cheaper price, I am posting a 5-star for the Sunter as a best-buy.
 This fan was a “treat yo self” item to replace this sad oscillating fan I previously had from Food 4 Less on sale and frankly I regret nothing about this purchase!<br/><br/>I originally purchased this due to my previous fan not being strong enough - I couldn’t feel a significant breeze when it passed by me. I didn’t buy this specifically because it had an ionizer but because I needed something more powerful and less clunky. Now my room is HUMID for so many reasons: huge old furniture in a tiny room, stale air with no circulation and even when I leave my window open for days the humidity never leaves because there is a tree right outside of it blocking any nice summer breezes. My room is UNBEARABLE. Especially when I have hot flashes, I am dying at night since I can get super easily hot and uncomfortable. With that being said this fan does THE JOB.<br/><br/>It is powerful and helps the circulation in my room. I always kept the fan in my room on not because I was hot but to circulate the stale air in my room to avoid my allergies going insane and this fan automatically makes my room feel fresh! My room does not feel as humid and I am in love with this fan!<br/><br/>I love that the fan comes with a remote but sadly it requires AAA batteries which is a downside to me because I never have AAA batteries handy only AA. But setting up this fan was quite easy!<br/><br/>Funny little advice: if you are tiny please set this up with another person. I am 5’2 and I didn’t realize how tall this tower fan was until I tried to shimmy it out of the box by myself and shook it so hard I smacked myself in the face with the ridiculously tall box. Plus the tower fan is so long that setting up the base on the floor was slightly inconvenient. Setting up the fan is quite self explanatory and very easy to do. This fan is easily almost taller than me and almost defeated me due to height.<br/><br/>Do not let my salty opinions discourage you. This fan is great! One other quirk about this is that on its lowest setting it is a bit noisy. I am used to sleeping with a tv on or the radio so be aware of this. Its not super loud but I know some people are very sensitive to noises when sleeping and do not factor this in. It is tolerable for someone like me to sleep while this is on the lowest setting because it just becomes background noise to me and if you are like me and can sleep to tv noises then this shouldn’t be a problem. It has a timer anyways in case you worry about turning it off.<br/><br/>I hope you like it as much as I do!
 Goodbye ugly box fan!  Hello gorgeous cooling tower!  This is the fan I've been dreaming of for years.  It is whisper-quiet and unobtrusive, while pushing out a lot of airflow.  I was surprised at how tall it was, but anything smaller probably wouldn't be as effective in my kitchen/dining room/living room combined space.  I am so happy with this purchase!
 Let ME tell you about this fan. It's easy, it's breezy and it ain't sleezy. Have you SEEN that woodgrain? Hold me back, I'm gonna get emotional. You're paying $55 here to voucher slip out of a damn heat stroke. The world's on fire, the globe is warming, but you're gonna be smart, right? With this (surprisingly tall) modern work of art you can fight Trump's dismissal of the EPA by setting one of these bad boys up in every city hall in your state. Not a humanitarian? Do what I do, and place it right by your head at night and get absolutely drilled in the face by that cool, angelic wind current. And don't even think about touching it with your hands, you got a REMOTE for that. I don't care if it's an elbows length away, you're gonna feel cooler than ever controlling it with infrared, baby. I gave this a 4 out of 5 in versatility to encourage Alexa integration.

As the temp rises in Oklahoma in the Spring and Summer, it's time to pull out the fans to help move the air-conditioned air around.  A quiet fan is needed for the bedroom for sleeping.  Hoping this would be the one, we ordered the Lasko 2551.<br/>After a couple of nights the fan began to tick, tick, tick tick.  A call to Lasko and the tech advised me to return the fan for exchange.  "It should not be doing that", said the guy.<br/>Well if the first fan was tick, tick, ticking...the replacement Lasko 2551 sounded like a garbage disposal chewing up a tin can.  Yikes! (As a side note, the box was pristine and did not show signs of damage, etc.)<br/>So fan #3?  Let's just say we went with Honeywell.
 I love this fan!  Some fans feel kind of weak, but this puts out a good bit of air.  I like how the top few inches has slots so you can direct the air up or down.  Not sure that it really makes much of a difference, but I like having the option.  I don't notice that the ionizer makes the air feel/smell any fresher (I have 2 dogs so I was hoping to notice a difference in air quality) but it does seem to make the air cooler somehow.  The oscillating feature is great for me.  Use it often and haven't had any issues with squeaking or clicking like other fans.  Haven't used the timer, but I can see how that might be handy.  My favorite feature is the remote.  It works great and I love how you can activate the power and all of the features with it.  I've noticed this fan doesn't collect dust as quickly as my old 3 blade fan did so that's a bonus too.  This is a great product and I've been extremely happy with it.
 The fan began making an annoying clicking sound like an old fashioned noise, ie like a small revolving blade with a plastic bit clicking over it, or a blade that's not tightly connected. I righted the screws but sound persists.I have passed the return window by a few days!. I Do not recommend it.<br/><br/>It arrived on time, box in perfect condition, on a hot San Francisco day. Had it set up in 10 minutes. Perfect for my hot South facing office. I agree with others, this does feel cooler than just circulated air. I was going to buy a window airconditioner, but if i can avoid air con I'd prefer to use the a la natural fan.
 I read a lot of reviews before deciding to purchase this product, and they were all pretty accurate.<br/>This is not an air conditioner. As much as you may want it to be, it is a fan. Sometimes it feels like the air comming out of it is coller, sometimes it’s in the same temperature as the room (just like a fan). I haven’t yet been able to determine what makes it cooler.<br/>This is, however, better than any other fan I’ve tried. It’s bigger, has good potency, and did a good job helping me survive the summer in Los Angeles.
 Only had for 1 night, but loving it so far.  I read a lot of reviews some stated that it was shipped in original box and the box and product were damaged.  I also received mine in the original box but had no issues at all. Neither the box or the fan were damaged in any way.  Only have to put the base together and it's very easy to do.  We have used pedestal oscillating fans for years, there is no comparison this fan is MUCH better than those.  I'm not sure how but it seems to blow out cooler air, not cold but cooler.  I love you can sit on the couch and fill it blow over your entire body, instead of just one area.  It's quite and last night when the house was quite it makes a noise but I find it soothing, nothing that would keep me awake or have to turn TV up louder to hear over it.  Live in FL, it's been a miserable August, a/c set at 80 all day every day turn it down at night and still runs too much for me and this fan will make it a lot more comfortable especially doing the day.  Wish we would of gotten this fan sooner (like years ago), we will start replacing the rest of our pedestals. Highly recommend and the pricing is great and it's an American made product and company.
 Bought this fan just over a year ago. Was always noisy but personally I appreciate white noise.<br/><br/>Eventually started squeaking + humming + loudly struggling when in use. I no longer appreciated this noise.<br/><br/>Then last month it started to burn somewhere inside (circuit board?). Filled up the whole apartment with the smell of fire, so now it's going into the trash.<br/><br/>Oh yeah - and you can't disassemble to clean it. Ended up collecting a crazy amount of dust by the time it was trash.<br/><br/>Would not recommend.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R2D2A2X7ILHB3A"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1fzRkedxkS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91z4R3ctvRS.png"/> Not a big fan of the colors. (pun intended)<br/><br/>I've had my fan for a week and it makes this chirping sound from what I believe to be are parts rubbing together.  It's super aggravating when I'm trying to sleep and only want to hear the breeze.  Will have to exchange this one before it gets worse and I'm stuck with it.
 I just wrote a review about the Vornado 184 tower fan. Let's just say that I was disappointed. This is why I returned it and now have this Lasko 2554 tower fan.<br/><br/>Trust me, this Lasko 2554 is approximately $45 cheaper and works much better. The Lasko is a good solid tower fan. It blows sufficient air and is pretty quiet as well. No tower fan is going to out perform a regular axial style conventional fan, hower tower fans look much sleeker. I'd rather give up a bit of airflow with a tower fan versus having a big ugly box fan.<br/><br/>This Lasko 2554 is a nice looking unit, it feels very solid compared to some others as well. It's not wobbly since it ocilates at the very bottom of the stand. I've had several tower fans over the years and this one blows pretty strong and is on the quiet to average side. It's much better than the Vornado in my opinion.<br/><br/>Based on my experience with tower fans. All will last a long time if you do these two things. Take the fan outside and blow the inside thoroughly out with compressed air a couple times per year. Also the number one failure will be the bottom bushing on all of these tower fans. Oil the lower bushing/shaft when you blow the fan out and it should last for many years.<br/><br/>I would recommend this fan!
 Not nearly as good as the reviews. Made well but puts out very little. Have 2 in a 16 x 20 area. Have to use air. Dont hardly believe all those 5 star reviews. Its 80 degrees outside figured i wouldnt need to run my air in my rv. Was very wrong.had to complain to amazon customer service because i would try to give this review and it wouldnt let me but if i pushes 5 stars i could complete my review. Its not a bad fan but its not a wow or great like the 5 star reviews say. Have had a whole lot better and its just an ok fan no where near as wonderful asvall the 5 star reviews say.
 I purchased this Lasko 2551 Wind Curve Platinum Tower Fan With Remote Control and Fresh Air Ionizer because it really gets warm in our room during summer. With all the fan I looked online this was the one I've chosen since most reviews were good.<br/>First of all, I really liked the looks of this fan. It has entirely plastic construction but of great design. It measures approximately 42.5 inches in height so, it is taller than most fan and it works much better in circulating the air. Only the base of the fan needs to be assemble. This came with 6 screws and my husband had no problem attaching the base to the fan itself. This tower fan arrived with an instruction manual and a remote control that needs two AAA batteries (which you need to provide since it is not included in the package). The fan had 3 speed settings, an auto shutt-off timer and can be use with or without oscillation. It is not noisy at all and very easy to use. The ionizer feature is a plus because it helps purify the air in a room and the bright blue LED doesn't bother me at all. Overall, I am impressed with this purchased! I certainly recommend this.<br/>This was posted 5% off in Amazon, so I bought this at a slight discount, and I paid a total of $65.24 including tax, so this is pretty a good deal for a great tower fan!
 We have only had this fan now for about a week.  I will come back and update my review as time passes, but I wanted to get some info out there.<br/><br/>I have a toddler and an infant.<br/><br/>Why I was not looking for a fan with blades:<br/><br/>Fans with blades can be a danger, but so can the heat, so I decided on a tower style fan for our rather small apartment.  Standing fans we have had in the past were easily tipped and the front metal plate or sometimes plastic was quick to pop off as it hit the floor blade still going strong.  Very scary when your child is just 2 and has tipped the fan.<br/><br/>My experience so far:<br/><br/>  *auto shut off<br/><br/>The first day I was quite worried as the fan had tipped (my husband the larger child in the home was playing with it) and it would not turn back on.  I became very worried.  I unplugged it and plugged it back in.  Sure enough this fan has a safety so that if it is tipped it will turn off.<br/><br/>  *durability<br/><br/>So far the baby has tackled it with his 26lb body and it has held up.  It is just tall enough that my toddler can't yet push the buttons.<br/><br/>  *noise<br/><br/>I didn't really care if the fan was quiet or not, but it was an added bonus that it is very quiet compared to our Lasko box fan.  If you aren't looking at the fan you would never know that it is rotating.  Also make sure you get the screws in the right place.  The diagram is poorly labeled.  That may be the problem with some of the fans people are having noise with.  There are more holes than there are screws and the diagram suggests that they go into holes that they really don't belong in.  I will include a picture of the base so you can see.<br/><br/>  *cooling factor<br/><br/>I was disappointed with the amount of air that it moved, and had I reviewed it on day 1 I would have only given it a 3 stars for that, but I have come to realize that while the air it moves isn't much, the air always blows out cool.<br/><br/>I find that on hot humid summer days some fans are just blowing around the hot air.  I was surprised to find that this fan seems to always have cool air.  No idea how but it does.<br/><br/>It also does a much better job cooling a room if you always have it on rotate.  If not the air just kind of stagnates.<br/><br/>  *packaging<br/><br/>I was very worried when it arrived as it was in the thin box the fan comes in rather than amazon packaging.  It already had holes in it.  I will be reviewing in my order the packaging as well and I suggest others do the same so they start packing it better.<br/><br/>  *ion thing<br/><br/>Tried it doesn't seem to change anything other than a blue light comes on.  I have no idea what it actually does.  Again bought this fan for safety reasons.<br/><br/>  *overall<br/><br/>I am pleased and hope to buy another when funds allow.<br/><br/>Update:  It has been about a month now and while my toddler has tackled this fan with his full body weight it is still fully functioning.  It has only actually crashed once of the many times hitting wood laminate floors.  Now that the weather is warmer it is still blowing cooler air than any other fan in our home.<br/><br/>Update: One year later; it is still running great and quietly.  The toddler has finally stopped tackling it, but it has survived several falls over the year.<br/><br/>Update: It is now June 2014 and we own two of these fans and both are going strong despite a toddler and autistic 6 year old who can now reach the buttons.  They also survived a trip in a moving truck to our new home.  We have more of an open floor plan now, so two doesn't really cut it for the kitchen/dining room/living room space.  The air kind of gets lost, so what I do to help them better cool a room is put them on opposite corners and face them at each other.  I plan to buy one more so I can have one in every room in the open space.  It also doesn't help that our new home has very old crank windows that only open at an angle and only so far.<br/><br/>Update 2018: nothing new to report. They all still work as before.
 After years of using round rotating fans, which did not have much power and collected cobwebs in the grills in front of and on the blades as well as behind them, I read in a very upscale catalogue about these type of straight up fans.  The upscalers wanted over $150 for this type of fan, and when I compared the specs, I knew I had a bargain at about $60 for this Lasko WInd Curve Fan which also ionizes the fanned air.  I bought it for my bedroom, which is a bit dusty because of the tons of books I have stored in it, and I noticed that I sneezed and coughed less than before I bought this unit.  Also, with this fan, I do not need to turn on the portable airco (when the sun hits my window in the afternoon)  as early as I had to before,  on hot days.  I highly recommend this fan.  I love it!
 Exactly what we wanted!  My husband loves this fan.  It has everything he needs ---  remote, oscillator, timer, different fan speeds, and it is the right height (perfect for keeping you cool while you sleep). The color is a nice medium gray and looks much better than a black one.  It is very quiet for a fan this size.  No clackety-clack, no unusual motor sounds, nothing at all that is unpleasant.  Enough white noise to be comfortable.  He can direct the air flow directly on him instead of both of us, or it will distribute the air all over the room.  Very nice product. The timer is an especially nice feature.  He thought he would not want a timer or remote but it turns out he wouldn't be without them now.  The perfect fan we have been looking for!!!!  I recommend this highly.
 I've never experienced a tower fan before. I live in a 2 room travel trailer in Texas and wanted a fan with smaller footprint and quieter than a traditional fan. This fan really is all that and a bag of chips. I was so impressed after the first 24 hours, I ordered another one for the other room, plus a permanent electrostatic filter for each.<br/>I have lung issues, so I could tell the ionizer feature works. The ionizer "on" light is a bright blue beacon. I put a small piece of black tape over it, but I can still see a slight blue halo to tell if it is on.<br/>The remote is really nice and simple. I only use 1 remote for both fans. I put the second remote away for backup in case my cats hide the remote in use.<br/>I have never before had a fan so powerful but so quiet. It really moves the air, but my TV volume remains the same as before.<br/>I had them assembled in less than 5 minutes each. There were 2 small Phillips screws to secure the 2 snap together base pieces, and 4 thumb screws to attach the base to the fan. It is quite tall, but the base is stable. I'm not worried about my cats knocking it down. As a matter of fact, my cats like the new tower fans better.<br/>These fans are more than worthy of the investment of the permanent electrostatic filters to extend fan life and help the ionizer with cleaning the air. I'll be installing mine as soon as they arrive.<br/>I had no issues with delivery or condition of either fan. Mine came through the United Stated Postal Service in excellent condition. Both fans (and their boxes) were blemish free with all buttons and features in factory fresh working order. I've had no negative issues whatsoever. I would buy this fan again in a nano second, and would proudly give it as a gift.
 I don't even remember how much I paid for this fan but it was totally worth it. I live in the mid west where summer is like living in satans armpit so my hopes werent really that high when I found out that I drunkenly impulse bought a weird fan that swivels. But the fan looks fancy, I dont know what the ionizer does but its fanrastic. The fan is real quiet for the amount of air it blows out (which is a lot) and it rotates quite a bit to cover my 20x20 living room. For someone suffering from a swamp cooler, this has literally saved my life from melting into my couch from the sheer heat of my house.
 I have had this less than a day and the infernal hum is driving me bonkers. It's not the fan - that's white noise. This is literally the hum of the motor. And it's an out of tune B. If you're a trained musician DO NOT get this, you will never stop thinking about it anytime the fan is on. It tried running it for a while to get used to it and found myself tensing up. Finally turned it off and I immediately relaxed. Call me ridiculous but this is getting returned tomorrow. I'm already done with it.
 This is a Revision to my previous bad rating that I can’t seem to edit: I chose a Lasko tower fan because my friend has several and over the years she hasn’t had any issues with them. I loved mine at first as it’s very quiet, cools the room within minutes and is easy to set up and maneuver due to its design. But then within two and a half months the fan started making odd noises on lower settings. I was really disappointed and called Amazon, they said I couldn’t return it to Amazon but I could call Lasko as my fan was still under their warranty. So I contacted Lasko and had the best customer service experience I think I’ve ever had (I spoke with Mary) and they’ sending me a new replacement. I highly recommend purchasing Lasko products due to their excellent warranties and customer service!
 Overall quality is very good, I like the remote, and the airflow is just downright impressive (this moves more air then any fan I've had in house -- it can BLOW!), but after a few months of near continuous use, it's started making a slight rubbing noise when oscillating. Happy with the purchase despite this development (only one spot as it sweeps left to right).  Nitpicking here since It hasn't been enough to investigate and I imagine some silicon spray to the base would do the trick but wanted to account for why this wasn't 5 stars for me.
 Just had it for a day so far it provides us with a cool room. The blue light that people are crying about isn't even that strong, but it really depends on you..it shouldn't warrant one less star just because of that. I took a picture and you can see how weak that light is.<br/><br/>I don't need it to oscillate (swivel), so that's not a concern either.<br/><br/>Overall it's a good fan. It's a fan and not really an air cooler, it just has very strong blades so it blows wind harder than the regular fan.<br/><br/>This is an unpaid review. I might change it by hopefully I don't need to.
 I used to have the Ozeri 3x Tower Fan, which lasted for about two years, running almost day and night during non-winter seasons. It had absolutely incomparable air circulation, and even at the lowest 1-fan setting it could cool a 20x20x12 room efficiently. I loved it. THAT SAID, I had consistent problems with the electronics in the Ozeri. The biggest was that it would spontaneously shut off after an hour or two running at full blast. This was usually remedied with a shake or a slap (clearly a bad circuit somewhere), but still annoying on really hot days when I wanted more than a nice breeze (#FirstWorldProblems). At the beginning of the summer, it had one of its full blast fits, died, and no amount of shaking, slapping, or fiddling with the circuitry could revive it. RIP Ozeri.<br/><br/>Can't really comment on the annual durability of my new Lasko Wind Curve, as I've only had it for about 4 months, but I've had zero problems thus far. Although the air circulation at top speeds isn't quite as powerful as the Ozeri, it has been running continuously at the highest setting (plus oscillation) since it came out of the box. The ionizer has been on as well.<br/><br/>Another huge plus: the Lasko is quiet. It's quieter than any tower fan I've ever owned. I mean... perhaps I'm just used to the dull roar of the Ozeri, but I can't even hear the Lasko from more than 10 ft away.<br/><br/>All in all a good solid replacement. I'm very happy with the purchase.
 Surprised by the size height..42" is tall.  However, for my application it is a great size, narrow, I was tripping over my Large Vornado way too often.  This item sits in the same  doorway and I have not tripped yet!.  The assembly was fairly easy.  I am hoping easy regular cleaning with vac and canned air.  The Base seems a bit wobbly but I think that might be a function of the oscillation.  Very quiet and moves the air fine.  I cool a 13x12 room in a home with no insulation (90 yr old home in CA)  I also supplement the air flow with the large Vornado at the other end of the room.  Works great.  I do not use it in the middle of the room and I do not have it back against the wall.  I have it in the doorway to draw the AC or air from the kitchen.
 I have plenty of friends and business people who have Lasko fans, and they are phenomenal (my friends as well as their fans :). This fan, however, is a serious disappointment, not because of its construction, but because at the highest (3) speed, one can feel output air from a mere two feet, no more. SO, if you are expecting a big change from 1 to 3, forget it! There was basically no difference between each level.<br/><br/>ALSO, the box arrived as though it had been repackaged. The product was not damaged, but the box had definitely been re-taped, with extra cardboard to fill in the gaps (should have taken pictures, but I didn't, because I have always relied on Lasko products). Its " sophisticated, wind-curve profile, wide scale oscillation and, 3 quiet, yet barely distinguishable speeds" are definitely not up to par for a Lasko!<br/>Considering the cost, one could certainly find a fan that provides more power and cool air than this one for less money. So I will go to Bed Bath and Beyond, Lowes or Home Depot, so that I can SEE what I am buying.  DO NOT BUY it, unless you live in a closet !!:) I really wonder, in the end, if Amazon cares about these reviews; I really doubt it.
 First- package came damaged. Don’t know if that’s the shipping company’s fault or what but still. No damage to the actual product that I can see visually. Upon taking off all the plastic wrap I must have dropped the two flat head screws that come with it because when I went to assemble the base, I couldn’t find them. Found them after I replaced them with screws out of my own supply. So, be cautious when removing the plastic. You may drop something.<br/>I’ve seen some other reviews that complain about the noise but honestly, it’s a fan. It’s going to make noise. But I find that it’s not any louder than your standard upright fan you buy at Hime Depot or wherever. The only thing that bugs me is at night, the bright blue light that indicates the ionizer is on blinds me while I’m trying to fall asleep. Since it’s 2:00am right now and I can’t sleep because of it, I’d say it’s an issue.<br/>Lastly, I want to point out that this is NOT air conditioning. It is a fan with an air ionizer. Basically, it blows cooler air than a regular fan would but not as cold as an AC unit can be. Currently working well in my bedroom with the window open about 3 inches to keep air flowing in.
 I love this fan!<br/>PROS:  I can carry it to any room I want.  I'm 73 and not very strong anymore so I was delighted that I could pick it up.<br/>  I keep it mostly in my bedroom so I can sleep in this heat.<br/>  It actually feels to me like it has more of a cooling breeze than a regular fan.<br/>  It has 3 settings and I have it on the lowest and still need a blanket on me even in this heat.<br/><br/>CONS:  I don't think it has a long enough cord.<br/>  I cannot use the Ionizer because the blue light is very annoying and too bright.<br/>  The remote leaves a lot to be desired. If I didn't have long fingernails, I probably wouldn't be able to push the buttons to turn it on and off.<br/>  As nice as the fan is, the remote is kinda crappy.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  May 17, 2018<br/>Temps here are getting warmer so I got the fan out of the closet.  As in my previous review, I wasn't looking forward to using the remote.<br/>But........last fall I bought a Lasko 6435 Designer Series Ceramic Oscillating Heater with Remote Control.  As I was putting away the heater for the season, I picked up the remote just to try and see if it would work on the fan.  IT DOES!!!!  And it's a much better remote.  I am so happy and love both products.
 It is a good quality. But this fan is absolute junk in how much it blows, as well as the noise level. It sounded like plastic was hitting plastic at a high speed. Somewhat like a noticable rattle. So, I requested a replacement, and it made the same exact sound. On closer inspection, that "rattle" is the little propeller blowing air. That noise was normal. So I went through the hassle of returning and replacing this fan 2 times, for a rattle that was normal.<br/><br/>As for the blowing, on the highest setting, it is barely noticable.<br/><br/>This is NOT a white noise fan. Its irregular rattle was beyond annoying I ended up going with a normal circular fan. And that was the best choice for both sound and airflow. (Doesnt look as nice compared to some of these towers. But gets the  job done much better)
 I have owned this product/model before so I already knew what I was getting.  I have had my Lasko for many years.<br/>We recently had a heat wave, and my old fan died during that time. (note: it came back to life for a friend of mine- LOL) Anyway Amazon to the rescue for me, and my friend is happy with my old fan so win/win.<br/><br/>Pro's:  easy to assemble, I like the output. The cool breeze feels wonderful<br/>Con's:  Slight noise on the highest setting - but it is worth it when I feel cool air on my face.  The noise does not bother me, even when sleeping.<br/>  Cleaning the fan on the inside is almost impossible.  I have ordered a washable filter to put on the back.  That should cut down on all the<br/>  fuss.  I can't wait for the filter to arrive. It comes from another vendor.
 I bought this fan based on all the fantastic reviews I read. I am disappointed. Though I do love that the fan is so quiet, I am very disappointed in the air output. I live in SC where it is humid in the summer months. I am also menopausal. I have to have a fan at night, in addition to AC. I have a pedestal fan which does a good job of moving the air around, but it's kinda' noisy, so I bought this one instead. I keep the fan on the high setting, but I really can't tell it's on. I'll probably keep it to use in another room, just to help keep the AC bill down a little, but will continue to shop for something that cools me at night.
 I had an earlier version of this fan about 5 years ago and loved it until my son's dog chewed the cord in half...bye bye fan - grrrrrr dog. I purchased this newest version recently and am LOVING the concept all over again! It's a quiet fan (doesn't disturb my sleep or conversations), looks nice, saves space, oscillates or not (your choice), was easy to put together (just needed a Phillips head screw driver for 2 screws on the base) and comes with a REMOTE CONTROL!!! Last night I had it sitting in the dining room facing the living room and even on low it was stirring the curtains behind me on the other side of the living room - without getting up from my chair I pointed the remote at it and switched it to oscillating so the dog (grrrrrr dog) could feel the breeze on her dog bed too. This is my 3rd Lasko fan (the one in the garage has been going strong for 5 years now) and I don't think I'll ever buy another brand...Lasko to me means good price, good functionality, excellent reliability and easy to put together.
 THIS IS THE FAN TO GET, IT  LOOKS GREAT, QUITE, VERY STURDY, X GD QUALITY PRODUCT. AND WITH IONIZER IT,S A FAN I WILL ENJOY FOR A LONG TIME. I BOUGHT 2 TOWER FANS, A  LASKO, AND A HOLMES, REMOTE NEVER WORKED ON THE HOLMES, IT WAS LITE WGT, EASILY TIPPED OVER, AND NO APPEALING LOOK TO IT. LOVE THE WOOD GRAIN ON THE LASKO, REMOTE WORKS GREAT...,
 Wow do I love this fan. I live in an adorable pre world war 2 apartment with no central AC and only ceiling fans. I was actually looking to purchase a wall unit but for some reason decided to check out a floor fan. I could not be happier with this and am really happy I purchased it. Southern California summers are hot! But within 10 minutes of turning this on the living room significantly cooled down. I don’t know how this is possible considering that it’s a fan and not air conditioning but it does. Frankly, I don’t care if it’s voodoo. It works. The fan is also light enough to transfer from room to room if need be but considering the price point I just may buy another one instead. I highly recommend this! Also, it took all of 5 minutes (that’s a generous over estimation) to assmble the base and the power light is a tiny blue light.
 I have tried so many tower fans and always disappointed. This fan is different. It is STRONG. I went ahead and bought the separate dust filer and that makes the fan even better. Remote is easily understood. However, their statement that it has an easy carrying grip is not true. I like this so much that last summer I tried to order a 2nd one, but out of stock. I got smart and purchased 2nd one during the winter, had it ready to go. Also so excellent that my visiting allergic nephew did very well with it with the dust filter added. He now has 2.
 When I first started dating my partner about 2 years ago, I was surprised to hear that she was dependent on having a fan on all night to get to sleep. After sleeping with her box fan for so long, I was shocked to find that I was now dependent on it too and had a hard time coping when it broke. We didn't replace the fan for a few months until we moved to a place that is much, much quieter and now the silence at night can be quite unsettling. I decided to go ahead and look for a new box fan, but came across this instead in my search, and I'm very happy to have gone with this tower fan instead. The benefits - It stands up tall enough to reach us on the bed! The oscillating function covers a wide area. I'm not afraid my puppy is going to get her snout chopped off my sniffing at it. Powerful enough to actually be effective as a fan and cool us at night - enough so we can turn the A/C off to save on the electric. The only cons I can list are that, while it was VERY easy to assemble, it does seem kind of wobbly, so I try not to fuss with moving it too often. The wobbly-ness doesn't seem to affect the oscillation, though.  Also, I'm pretty dubious about the air purifying functionality - I can't really tell any difference to speak of and I have two dogs. Plus, how am I supposed to clean it if it is purifying, anyway? Luckily, I'm very satisfied without this function, but if it actually IS working, then all the better. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this fan - it's a great price for a lot of functionality.
 This tower fan is oversized/bulky and not at all a space saver as it advertises on the product box. It also lacks power. I'd recommend it for a small room. If you want to buy this for a large room, don't bother. It does not have enough power to circulate air throughout a large room or really an average sized room. It only has three power settings and there isn't a vast difference between the three settings. I'd strongly recommend the QuiteSet tower fan by Honeywell which I have in another room which I also purchased here on Amazon. The air on that one blows really cold and works quickly to cool the room and it has more than three power settings and it is powerful.  This Lasko fan is a good fan. I just don't recommend it if power is what you are seeking and if you are seeking a space saver. This fan is taller, heavier, and wider than my QuiteSet. I bought this fan for someone else  for another room and they are enjoying it but I personally wouldn't buy this fan for myself.
 I love this thing expecially for the price. I live in a studio apartment in didn't want an AC unit because sometimes they put out way too much air and I love the whole remote control option (makes me feel fancy lol) . It was fairly easy to assemble, it took me maybe 15 minutes if even. The highest setting could definitely keep a whole room cool for in my case my entire studio apartment and the lowest setting is just enough if you want just a little bit of air and you don't want to be hot and you feel it right away. Definitely stronger than a basic stand up fan or window fan. I prefer this because I don't like to be very hot or very cold and the lowest setting gives me that option. Even on the lowest setting, and I live in San Francisco (it is the summertime if you want to compare what that might feel like), if I sleep with the fan on it will be chilly in the morning so it's very effective.
 very nice features with easy to use remote-QUIET  likes esp at night
 I wasn’t much of a fan of tower fans in the past. They never seemed to last long and were clunky and top heavy. Not this one, it’s rather quiet, blows a good volume of air and is pretty stable.<br/><br/>The remote control works great and the fan is rather quiet for what it is. It replaced an older Lasko round fan that we had for a long time. I wouldn’t hesitate to replace my next fan with another one of these as well.
 I'm a fanaholic. I have to have a fan running at night. I need the sound and movement of air. Originally this fan was for the kitchen,  I wanted the ionizer in there to eliminate cooking smells and smoking when friends came over and to cool down the area while baking.  It worked fairly well for those three reasons. Now I moved it to the bedroom and I'm sleeping better. It's not loud but there is enough sound for me and I think the ionizer might be helping me sleep a little better. Lol. I've used the fan for about 3 to 4 months and it's running great,  no problems. It has a small profile so it doesn't take up too much room even though it is 4 ft tall. Initially I thought the base was going to give me trouble because it is a cheap plastic but so far so good. If the base breaks the fan will not be usable, simple as that. So I'm giving 4 stars for that reason.  It is just stupid to make this great fan and attach a cheap plastic as the base. Don't go cheap on the most important part of the product! Ĺike the makers are going to read this lol. Enjoy the fan,  be careful when attaching the base, I'm sure you'll be fine.
 It's crazy to me how I see nothing but 5 star ratings and I have the fan on right now and the room is still warm. It literally has to be directly on me to get some relief. It's 82 degrees outside at the moment, the fan has been on all night and I'm sticky you guys. It might be TMI but whatever dude.....I'm sticky. I live in Brooklyn, I don't have that big of room, I'd say about 18x12ish, idk just eye balling. But it's not giving me what I need, it's not working out. I just put in a request to return.
 This is a nice fan, though not much of an improvement over my old circular fan. I can feel a substantial breeze from it even six feet away. It doesn't blow over as broad an area at once as my old circular fan. The range of oscillation is also a little disappointing. If I lay down in front of it lengthwise, it can cover from my head down to my upper thighs. The range is not quite enough to cover my entire queen sized bed when I place it at the foot of the bed. I like the feel of the air coming out of this tower fan better than the air coming out of my circular fan but I just wish it covered a wider area at once.
 We bought 2 identical fans.  Superb and quiet cooling.  What great features, too!  Both are in upper-level rooms that are 12 x 18. Powerful fans that oscillate.  Second fan arrived and did not work properly.  Amazon replaced it in just a matter of days.  If I can't find it on Amazon, I probably don't need it!!!!
 I think this is a great fan. Somehow the air blowing from it feels wayyyyyyyyy cooler than the air in the rest of the room, and I've had several others that simply pushed warm air around and helped nothing. The ionizer works wonderfully and the fan is incredibly quiet. I have bought 2 of them now, and they're pretty durable. I have tile floors downstairs and the second one rolled off the couch as I was installing the base and still works perfectly with not a single mark on it. My only complaint is that the screws for the base are kind of cheap. I tried to remove one and the plastic grip came right off, so I guess it's stuck there now. Also, sometimes they leave the 2 normal screws out, I suppose, but that's not so big a deal. All they do is secure the two halves of the base together a bit better, and they're so small and easy to find anywhere that it's easy enough to replace them for less than $1. Overall, these fans are amazing and well worth the cost.<br/><br/>* (Oct. 18, 2018) removed one star as my upstairs unit has starting making a clicking noise as of this morning. I've had several fans of this type before and this sort of thing has never happened. I suppose I'll be taking it apart later on to see what the issue is.....<br/><br/>** (Nov. 3, 2018) Lasko was incredibly helpful, although incredibly slow, in replacing the defective fan. They didn't have the same model, so they sent me a far more expensive one to replace it. At least you can rest assured that they'll do their best to help out with warranty replacements if anything should happen to the product.
 Don’t buy.  It is unstable on the base so it wobbles around every time you move it.  I have used less than 10 hours and the fan has started making a horrible clicking sound.  Sending it back.  Also, it only oscillates 90 degrees, so you don’t get full room coverage.  The remote is handy, but the receiver doesn’t work well so you wind up clicking the buttons over and over.  All in all, it’s a piece of junk.
 I love these fans. My first apartment didn’t have ceiling fans or working AC and this saved me and my roommate throughout the summer. I love the remote controls. I have two of these fans(one new one used) and the remotes work on both which is nice. I use them in front of my bed now so keep me extra cool at night. I wanted something with a purifier and I couldn’t be happier! I really do notice a difference when the air purifier is one. Sleek. Easy to transport ( I have moved them to three homes with no issue.) The only issue I have with these is cleaning them. It’s a little difficult if you let dust/lint build up. With a vacuum and qtip or old toothbrush they clean right up! Would buy again and I have recommended these to multiple people
 So, I’ll admit two things right off the bat.<br/>One, I cannot speak to durability, as I’ve had it for less than a week.<br/>Two, this was a needed but off the cuff purchase.<br/>My living room fan was old and the motor burned out. The Holmes fan in my bedroom was moved to the living room, and I decided to purchase the Lasko fan after an hour of research. I chose this fan for the ionizer component, as Colorado has been subjected to some bad fires with a ton of soot in the air. Anything that helps that is A+.<br/>I do agree that the blue light is a bit intense, so I cannot sleep with it on. But for the size, it’s very quiet, and puts out a fair amount of air.<br/>I will admit that I never thought to measure it out, so it’s quite big. However, it goes above the top of the mattress, so I can actually feel it, which is nice. I’ve included a pic for comparison with bed height, and it standing next to my little Holmes tower fan.<br/>Overall, a great purchase.
 I just got my Lasko fan today.  I love it!  It was so easy to put together, just need to screw in the bottom with 6 screws.  I love the sleek cool look and it is so quiet on all the speeds.  I have central air in my house but my bed room since I have the high ceilings the central air does not work so great in the humid hot days.  This is perfect and I love how the height is  42 inches.  I am thinking of getting a 2nd one for either the other bedroom or the living room.  I did a lot of research looking for a tower fan and read all the reviews. I highly recommend this.
 Works great! We only have a 10x14 living room, but the air reaches all parts of the living room, even on low. It even helps cool our kitchen from the living room.The timer is great. The noise isn't so loud that it disrupts enjoying the living room, but it would be adequate enough for white noise while sleeping if we used it in the bedroom instead.<br/><br/>It chills the room pretty quickly and when you live in an area without a/c, that's a great thing for hot August days.<br/><br/>We have such a tiny living room that I didn't want a big ugly eye sore taking up so much space, so the wood paneling is a nice touch.<br/><br/>It's easy enough for the kids to to turn on and off and doesn't topple easily.
 This was a badly needed upgrade for the fan we previously used.  I am pleased with it in every way.  We use it in our great room (family and dining room combined) and it does well to move the air through the larger size of the room and cool it down.  It is also very quiet and we can easily listen to our TV even on the highest fan setting.  The air that comes out does seem to be cold as other reviewers have mentioned.  The remote control is a bonus and comes in handy in the living room setting.  On extra  hot nights, this fan goes in our boys' room and the timer makes a convenient feature for that.  The oscillation is great and very soothing sound in the bedroom at night.  I can't mention one downside to this fan.  Very pleased with this purchase.
 I bought 2 of these last year and they are a great product. I ordered and received 2 more for this summer. As I soon as I saw the boxes I knew they had been previously returned &amp; repackaged. After assembling the base on one sure enough, it’s broken. Only has 1 speed - high, luckily that’s just want I wanted for today being that we are in the middle of a heatwave. I get that sometimes thing are returned &amp; repackaged but check them out, make sure they are fully functional before reselling at full price and inconveniencing your customers.
 I was so excited to get this fan to cool off my above garage apartment. Easy assembly and good instructions. The reason I’m giving only a three star rating is because the remote control does not work at all. ( Yes I put in batteries correctly, ) it is very quiet and puts out a nice amount of airflow. I don’t understand why the remote does not work, but that was one of the reasons I ordered this fan. I like to turn off the fan from my bed in the mornings so I can get out of the covers and get my day started. I can only sleep when I’m cool and like to wake up not so cool.
 I like this fan. We shopped around a lot before buying one. It blows really cool air and its light so I can move it from room to room easily. We have noisy neighbors so it also makes a great white noise machine in in our bedroom. Even on the highest setting, it does not disrupt our sleep. I also like the ability to point the vents up or down. The remote clips on to the back which is awesome because its small -- and I tend to misplace things. :)<br/><br/>The cons - which are not a deal breaker for me but could be for others --  I wish it osclated a bit more. it does not rotate a full 180 degrees. Also the base is a but wobbly // The buttons on the remote are not backlit so until you memorize it, its impossible to use in the dark in the middle of the night// the ionizer on light is a bright blue. The power light is green which isnt annoying but we had to put a piece of electrical tape over the blue one. If it was on the bottom it probably wouldn't be as invasive.<br/><br/>I thought an ION option was a good idea. I have read that it could make allergies worse. Its one reason we chose this fan, but I like that there is the ability to turn it off.<br/><br/>All in all, I am happy with it. If It were a bit cheaper I would buy another for my living room. I will most likely buy a Lasko again but without the Ionizer.
 I live in Central Florida and have no A/C. The heat and humidity can be brutal here. I work from home via computer, so that's where I am all day long.<br/><br/>I love Lasko tower fans. The one that had been my faithful companion through many summers finally gave up this morning. Uh-oh.<br/><br/>So I hurried over to Amazon and was thrilled to find that the Lasko 2554 was eligible for same-day delivery. I pounced on it.<br/><br/>I spent the afternoon panting with my tongue hanging out. The fan arrived a little while ago. Assembling the base was a snap, and I am no longer in danger of dying from heat stroke. What an incredible difference these fans make! Ahhhh. I am happy (and so is my boss).<br/><br/>Thank you, Lasko and Amazon! I'm looking forward to spending many years with my Lasko 2554. I give it my highest recommendation!
 Just set this up and I love it! I have a window air conditioner midway down the hall. It does a good job of cooling but doesn't reach the back bedroom. This fan fills in the gap. It's quiet, forceful and pulls the cool air from the hall into the bedroom with ease. It's easily portable as well. I'll buy another one soon.
 I bought 2 of these fans two years ago.  I liked them so much I recently bought a third one.  They still work quietly (daily) with no rattles.  Installation time: 12 minutes after removing the fan from the box.  Tools needed: scissors for the plastic wrap.  One phillips screwdriver.  Suggestion: Place the fan on a bed and hang the bottom of the fan over the edge of the bed for easy installation of the base to the tower.  Aim the fan grill toward the ceiling before installing the base.<br/>I like this fan because the connection between the tower and the base is thicker than many other tower designs.  This adds some stability and durability that other tower fans lack.<br/>This fan is 42" tall but only uses 1 sq. ft. for the base.  Like most tower fans, you don't want to knock them over and expect them to remain quiet fans.  But under normal use they are excellent.  I use three fans in one bedroom.  Here's why:  (1) aimed toward the shower for 10 or 15 minutes after showering to evaporate the water off the tiles.  This prevents/reduces mildew from growing in the grout in humid climates. (2) aimed at me when I come out of the shower so I don't get hot. (3) aimed out the bedroom door to pull heat and moisture out of the bedroom/master bath.  I love a 'wind tunnel' in the morning in south Florida.<br/>By nature, tower fans do not throw as much air as those big conventional huge blade fans with large footprints.  But the small footprint of a tower fan can be very desirable in certain cases.  Think 'skyscraper'.  Think hot office cubicle that needs cooling down.  Note: these fans do not come with hepa filters.  You probably need to pay more to get a good hepa filter fan.  I'm not sure.<br/>One more thing.  I rarely use the oscillating feature so I don't know how long the bearings will last.  I also never use the remote.
 I love this fan.  Quite a few reviews mention it is too loud, so I was worried that it would be a problem, but I don't think it is loud at all!  I purchased the fan for my bedroom and actually like a bit of white noise at night, so was actually hoping it would be a smidge louder.  So don't get hung up on the loud vs quiet debate, it's really a matter of perception, so you'll need to decide that for yourself.<br/><br/>Love all of the features of this fan, the different settings, the timer and of course the remote.  Seriously people, how did we ever live without a remote on every appliance we own, lol.  We just moved to North Carolina and the month of August was brutal, so hot day after day, week after week.... we had the A/C on constantly, but it would still get a bit stuffy at night.  We desperately needed a fan to help keep cool and this fan did the job and allowed us to keep the a/c temp higher at night and stay cool with the fan.
 The fan is pretty quiet (when not oscillating) but it does not have a lot of air flow. It is impossible to thoroughly clean without taking the entire fan apart. After a while the air flow decreases  (I am assuming from not being able to clean thoroughly) and the fan runs louder now than when it was new. After about a month it started making a popping sound when oscillating, this is very annoying. I would not but again.
 I’ve had this fan a few months now and it works very well. Unbeatable for the price and size of this thing. That said, 2 little things I dislike which is why I gave it 4 stars. The radius it covers when it’s on oscillate is not wide enough. It’s probably a total turn of 65 degrees or so. My old fan would turn to cover the whole room (about a 90 degree sweep). Not a huge deal but could be better. Then I want to address the noise level, it is not crazy loud but I would not label it “quiet”. It is fairly loud on speed 1 for someone sleeping in a quiet room. But again not terrible, just not a “quiet” fan. Overall, it’s definitely worth it for a small or large room, it big and powerful and cools well.
 This Lasko is a great fan and my wife is a fan of the fan. It has three speeds and, with the built-in swivel, really circulates the air. We do not have air conditioning (we live near the beach) and this fan gets a lot of use during the few hot days we have in the summer. It also can be programmed to operate at specific times, but we have not tried this as yet. We highly recommend it.
 after visiting my dads house He had a similar fan that was literally like a strong wind it was amazing. I was looking for one like that and saw all the reviews and figured this must be as good. Unfortunately not even close. The length of the fan does seem to cool nicely but not nearly the CFM I was hoping for its also much quieter than the regular oscillating house fan.
 I'm really happy with this fan. I've been wanting a tower fan for a while and decided to just break down and order one a few months ago. I bought this specifically for my bedroom because there was no way to circulate the air there. It does a great job. It cools the room quickly and is a lot quieter and more pleasant than an oscillating fan. Its also stylish and looks very sleek.<br/><br/>My favorite feature is the remote. It's super convenient. I also love that I can turn on the timer and fall asleep to the sound of the fan but not waste energy by running it while I'm sleeping. This was a BIG bonus for me. I don't really notice much of a difference when I use the Ion feature. Not sure if it really does anything, if I'm being honest.<br/><br/>The only thing that I would count as a negative is I noticed when I use the control panel on the fan itself, the tower sways a little. It has never fallen over, but the small plastic base makes me feel uneasy about the stability of the whole unit. I have mine set up in a corner, so nothing can bump into it or knock it over. I might be a little uncomfortable setting this out in the open in a different room...particularly one with high traffic. Otherwise, I love this thing. Really happy to have discovered it!
 If you're like me and can't afford an air conditioner, or also like me have a space too large for one, this fan is as close as you can get (In the reasonably priced range anyway).  This is a HUGE fan, but it is very light and easy to move.  Also very simple to assemble.  The settings on it are very powerful, and I love the Ionic breeze setting.  That was something I never thought I would find in my budget.  I love that this fan comes with a remote, which has large buttons for older users, and images rather than words if need be.<br/><br/>Remote and Fan Include<br/><br/>1)  A silver center button to power on<br/>2)  A + Symbol to Choose between three different levels of strengths.  Be prepared to be blown away on three!<br/>3) An ION button for ionic breeze<br/>4) A clock symbol so you can set the fan to turn off after between 1 and 4 hours.  Like sleeping with a fan on, but hate waking up dry mouthed or cold from it running all night?  This is perfect for you!<br/>5) A rotating symbol to, you guessed it, rotate the fan.<br/><br/>The remote is small enough to store easily, but large enough that it won't get broken if dropped (living in a cement basement, this is often a concern for me).  A great way to keep cool this summer, freshen your living area, and dry anything all year round.
 Uses less office space than my previous 18" circular fan, I like the extra space. Doesn't tip over easily. I took off a star because it is NOT QUIET, as many reviewers suggested.  The fan itself is louder than my old fan, and it also has a relatively loud motor hum similar to the old fluorescent lights. I was hoping to have a fan quiet enough that I could also enjoy music at the same time, but this isn't the fan.  It puts out a lot of air, I use it on the low setting. I have only had the fan a week, I cannot speak to its longevity. I am concerned there is no practical way to clean the fan of dust, as the holes are smaller than any typical vacuum attachment. It is nearly 4' tall, and there is louvre that allows you to aim the flow up or down. It has a taller flow of air than my circular fan, which is nice. While the air flow is narrower, in width, than old school fans it can rotate back and forth roughly 80 degrees. This rotation is slow back and forth, and doesn't add any extra noise.  I like the remote control functions, so I can off the NOISE.
 I would have given this product a fairly good review, but we've had it THREE months and it has started to emit a bad odor - almost like it's burning - but not quite.  All I know is we're not going to use it anymore.  I don't have the original box so I can't send it back and it has turned into a BIG waste of money!  My only other complaint is that it is bigger than I expected it to be, but that's really my own fault because I didn't really "comprehend" the dimensions when I read the description.  I WISH it would have worked. It is powerful, fairly quiet, takes up minimal floor space, and COULD have been a nice fan.  I've had other Lasko fans that I've been pleased with.  I expected this to be of the same quality.  It's NOT.
 I am disappointed with this fan for one reason- power.  I bought this for my living room.  The idea of this was perfect- would fit better within the space it would need to go as compared to the large Vornado fan we were previously using.  It also oscillates so I thought it would move air around better in my living room.<br/><br/>The power stinks- even on the highest setting this fan does not even compare to the output of my Vornado.  My entire first floor would easily cool down with my AC unit and the vornado- but this fan and the AC unit just don't cut it.  The oscillation is minimal as well, but it is quiet.  The ion air feature seems to help with stale odors.  If you sit near it and it's not super hot then this fan is fine.  But outside of that it really isn't meeting my needs.
 I bought two of these fans, but have only opened one so far. This summer has been crazy hot! I have a two story home and the top floor is always warmer than below...I placed this unit in my bedroom by my vent and it really cools the space down! I also have a ceiling fan (that is much quieter), but it blows warm air from the ceiling. I love the height of the fan, as it is able to blow over my bed and does a great job. I only wish it was more quiet!
 Great, quiet fan that lasted for years (3-4, I think).  Until it started leaving little, gross crumbly balls of fan dust/grossness all over the place.  Seriously, it was gross.  So, after many months of deliberation I finally took it apart to clean it.  The cleaning, taking apart, and putting back together took a good 2.5-3 hours.  :(  And without a fan to cool me off I was sweating a ton.  After putting the the last screw in place, my newly cleaned fan was ready to go.  But alas, I broke the bloody thing.  Somewhow I messed up the motor when taking it all apart and/or forgot to plug something in.  So, lesson learned (which my wife called out before I even started the stupid project):  you'll probably break it when trying to clean it, but might not, but probably will.
 I ordered this fan to replace a janky blade fan and let me tell you, the difference is amazing! I no longer have dust and pet hair blowing into my face. I also bought the fan filter which is sold separately and that has been a lifesaver for keeping dust and pet hair out of the interior of the fan which is probably quite hard to clean. Surprisingly, this fan puts out cool air which has again been great for the unusually hot Portland weather. Not sure what the ion setting does but I’m sure it adds to the value somehow. Great price point too, I would highly recommend it!
 Needed a fan for my living room and I had purchased a Lasko years ago and was pleased with it.  This fan has a very sturdy base so it will not fall over like other tower fans. The height is 42” so you feel it all over, not just your feet. I put it on the highest setting during the day and down to the lowest at night so I can sleep.  Wonderful fan with a shut-off timer, remote control and ion feature.  Very pleased with it.
 Features are average for a tower fan. Mechanically the fan is sound and appears to be well built. The fan output is average. The tower is larger than it appears in the preview..pay attention to the dimensions in the specifications tab to ensure it accommodates your space requirements. Some light assembly is required to attach the base with three screws. A Phillips head screw driver is required for assembly. The fan comes with a remote control.
 Not as quiet as I thought it was going to be. My normal fan with blades/oscillation is actually quieter. But I do like this fan, it does a nice job and I really like the timer feature on this. I don't know if the ionizer actually does anything but I still turn it on when I turn the fan on. Able to set the timer to a bunch of different options. Normally I just use the 1/2 hour or maybe 1-1.5 hr timer so I can fall asleep. It isn't noisy by any means, just not as whisper quiet as I thought it was going to be. Would buy another one if I needed another fan. Happy with my purchase and would recommend.
 MAKES NOISE RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. ITS HITTING ON THE BOTTOM AND MAKING NOISE. RETURNING IT!
 I'm a little late to review this -  I bought in April 2013, actually. I run this fan all night, every night, to provide white noise and airflow while I sleep. I'm very picky about fans; I don't want to hear anything but a perfectly smooth noise. This fan produces an audible, but not loud, crisp sound on high which is great for tuning out noises and sleeping to. There's no extra rattles, clicks, or anything else. In the past month or so I've heard a feint rattle come from the fan, but after bumping it, it seems to go away for a while. Something may just be loose; again, it's 4 years old and is still working near flawlessly, so this is definitely a 5-star fan. Bonus: the remote is super convenient.
 I bought this fan in the summer of 2006. It went with me everywhere, including dorm rooms and when I moved out of my parents' house. It cooled very well and also provided ambient noise at nighttime. I used to keep it on even during the winter and pointed it toward the wall because I was so used to the noise. Sadly, the fan started to go a couple weeks ago until it got to the point where it wasn't producing any air. I didn't bother trying to fix it; it lasted nearly eight years, which I was pretty happy with. Now that summer's coming, I need to replace it, and I'm probably going to buy another of this model.<br/><br/>EDIT 5/30/14: I ended up purchasing this model to replace the previous one I owned. However I've had to change my review from 5 stars to 3. The remote control in the new model is terrible! Even when pointed directly at the fan from a distance of 5 feet, it takes around 10 presses of a button to actually work. The remote for the fan I had from 2006 would work from anywhere in a room, and didn't even need to be pointed directly at the fan. I would just point it in the general direction and it would work. I don't understand how they could make it so much worse. It really impedes my use of the fan.
 It arrived in perfect condition and took less than 5 minutes and nothing more than my two hands to assemble (the base comes in two parts and there are a few screws to hold it in place.) It’s lightweight, attractive, quiet and POWERFUL. I live in an upstairs apartment in San Diego and last night I was miserably hot. The fan arrived today, and after 30 minutes of level 3 on oscalate my living and dining room were cool and comfortable. The fan is powerful, I can feel a steady force of air from more than 10-15 feet away. Those who have complained of the noise it omits must have unrealistically high expectations, or unreasonably low tolerance for white noise. If you want a silent fan, buck up and get the Dyson. If you want a remote controlled, quiet powerful fan for less than $60, buy this one.
 After quite a bit of searching, I bit the bullet on this tower fan based on its immense positive reviews. I too am also in that camp. The value of this fan is fantastic. It moves air better than some of the other tower fans I've used before and its pretty quiet. While it does feel *slightly* on the cheap side, it doesn't bring down my rating. If I had one complaint, it's the remote. You pretty much have to be exactly in line with the sensor for it to work. But I don't feel I need a remote that much. If I had two complaints, it'd be the remote (as mentioned) and the Ionizer LED– it's quite bright, so if you're on the sensitive side for light, you may find it distracting.  Both of those complaints really should not change your mind from purchasing this fan. You'll be very happy you did.
 This is my third  Lasko Tower fan.  The first two lasted over three years. This one didn't even make it three months.  These fans have an internal breaker that do not automatically reset and is not reachable by the user. Bad design and every failure i have had has been the breaker tripping when i was turning on the fan. Definitely not a problem on the power line.  Warranty requires I pay return shipping which will be outrageous from here in Hawaii so I will probably just give up on Lasko. Too bad because when they work they are the best fans out there. LASKO why don't you put a reset on the outside?
 I never bought this fan because I wanted the remote control, but it turned out to be an incredibly useful feature that I use quite often. I keep the fan on the opposite side of the room as I sleep and the remote control on my bedside table.<br/><br/>The fan is tall and puts out a significant amount of airflow. It is relatively quiet as fans go, and does not bother me when I'm trying to go to sleep.<br/><br/>I use this in my bedroom on summer evenings in conjunction with my central air conditioning. The result is that I do not have to keep my air conditioning turned down as low to be comfortable. Instead of wasting energy (and money) keep my whole house at a comfortable temperature at night, I can set my air conditioner at a higher temperature and use this fan in my bedroom to remain cool.
 I love this fan.  I had a Honewell before this which was really nice however the first time my cat ran into a box and then into the fan it fell.  The fall caused it to break to the point were it was worthless I was so sad.  I was looking at Lanko and reading a reviews about its sturdiness and one review said it can handle toddlers running into so I thought my cat is like a toddler so this should work.<br/><br/>So far so good.  I have had not issues with my crazy cats running it over.  it also is perfect with the amount of hair it blows out.  It has three different strengths and for the most part I keep on on the first because it is that good. It is so much better then I expected it to be and the oscillation is perfect helping the air in the room become cooler.  So far I have had it for a month and not issues, its not that loud at all.
 Outstanding! Really works to cool you down. My central A/C broke and I was debating on getting a portable A/C unit until it got fixed, but due to the high cost and one-time use, I decided against it. I'm so glad I purchased this fan, I will use it forever:<br/>-Cool that is also has an ionizer, good for low-level air purification.<br/>-Quiet, not very noisy at all compared to my box fan.<br/>-Powerful.<br/>-Has a remote. You may not think much of it until your on the couch or in the bed wanting to control your unit. This is a big plus.<br/>-Very responsive and oscillation is fast. May not seem like a big deal, but it makes for much better and even airflow.<br/>-Sturdy, well made, I've seen others in stores which were cheap and wobbly.<br/>-Extremely easy to assemble, no tools required except for a screwdriver for 2 screws.
 O.M.G. This fan is awesome. I don't know how but it makes the air feel cool even though it's moving around hot air. Perhaps it's the ionizer? The fresh air component is great; the air literally feels cleaner. This fan is truly a lifesaver during this unexpected heatwave we're having in Northern California.
 Died within 3 months of purchase, only used it occasionally..... I like it when it worked.  I kept it clean and it was used in a nice house,<br/><br/>Guess these just aren't built to last.<br/><br/>EDIT:  I took the fan apart and inside a small black box I found out what was wrong on the circuit board. A small 0.25 amp fuse blown.  There is no easy way to replace the fuse unless you have a soldering iron and the correct replacement fuse, however.. you can bypass the fuse, at your own risk, to get your fan working like new again (and prevent it from happening again)
 I got this fan when my older pedestal fan died after 4 years of loyal and diligent service. I must mention that my pedestal fan is used every single night for 6-8 hours because I can't sleep without the white noise of the fan. This fan provides the right amount of white noise and is fairly quiet during the night. The tiny light on the console does not bother me. The buttons are easy to operate, and it also has a remote. The overall look is stylish and goes well with my bedroom decor. It was easy to assemble and came with all necessary parts (had to use my own screwdriver). The fan provides breeziness in a 12x16 size bedroom, but not to every corner. I like the ionizing function for air filtering. The fan had a weird annoying smell during the first couple uses but that smell has diminished to almost untraceable levels now after continued use.
 I have this one for almost a year now.  Like many of the other reviews, when I received this item, it had a nasty, chemical smell to it, but that has all but dissipated.  Also, it made odd noises at first, but either I don't notice it anymore, or it stopped doing it (I think the latter being the case as I've just stopped to listen and can't hear any of the odd rubbing noises noted in other reviews).<br/><br/>The only thing I wish was different about it is the placement of the remote control.  In some of the reviews and pictures, it would seem that there is a slot on the back for the remote, but the fan I received has a small hook on the fan and the remote; it looks like it's supposed to just hang off the back of the fan.
 We needed something on the lanai to move the air around.  We wanted an oscillating fan that was narrow and didn't take up too much space. We also wanted something that was remotely controlled because of the location on the lanai.  The Lasko fan does the trick. It's quiet; has an oscillating range of about 120 degrees, a timer and 3 speeds.  We'll see how it holds up over the summer; it'll get a lot of use here in PCola.
 Review after 1 month:<br/><br/>The fan itself is much taller than you'd initially expect, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's tall enough to blow air above my bed, which I personally like. If you're looking for something that cools an entire room, this isn't necessarily it (I say this because I expected something that almost functions like A/C and fills the whole room with cool air) but I usually place the fan a few feet from where I am and as long as I'm within the trajectory of turning of the fan, I feel plenty of cool air.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, just last week the fan is having troubles turning. It makes a clicking sound and stays stuck in one place. We're going to try to take it apart and rebuild it to see if it fixes it but it sucks that it's already doing this.
 Received mine yesterday and it arrived in the Lasko box, no Amazon’s box. Good thing I was home when it arrived.<br/>Pros: Nice, elegant, big, quite, easy to assembly in about 10 minutes. It’s spring here in Texas, but tested it in the living room, about 10 feet away and the kids were complaining that they were cold.<br/>Cons: like another reviewer, I thought oscillation range or the swing could be wider, but in my case, from 10 feet away, it reached all of us and our seating area.
 This is perfect for the summer. Our old fan broke so it was time to get a new one. We picked this based on the look and price. This is a very good product, with just on level one it was able to cool down a 12x14 room with a crib and queen size bed. It's not absolutely silent when on an oscillating but it acts like a white noise to us. The look of it is very nice, I like the wood finish to it. Overall we love this, and we don't need to turn on the air condition. Bring on SUMMER!!!
 The Lasko has 3 speeds and is nearly silent at the first and second speed; the third and most powerful speed is just a little noisy but it's a low pitched noise.  I was surprised at how much air the fan pushes. It's comparable to a traditional fan and is very quiet. I use this fan in my bedroom to sleep.<br/><br/>I also have the Honeywell Fresh Breeze Tower Fan and had to return it.  The Honeywell also has 3 speeds and is nearly silent at the first speed (lowest speed), but very noisy at the second and third speed. The noise is high pitched. I don't know if it's a defect or normal.<br/><br/>The Honeywell pushes a tad more air than the Lasko.  However, the difference is very minor.  Also, some reviews say the Honeywell blows cold air. That's because their rooms are cool. This a fan and does not cool the air; rather, it circulates the air.  I think it's a little misleading that there's a temperature gauge on the Honeywell and you can "lower" the temperature. The Lasko is more straightforward.<br/><br/>So if you're deciding between the Lasko and Honeywell, I'd pay $10 more and go with Lasko.
 San Francisco just had one of the worst heat waves in history. We survived with old broken down jerry rigged LOUD fans. I'm in the market for a nice portable AC unit but not willing to spend the "heat wave" price. I'll wait till winter. In the meantime I ordered and just received my fans. I bought two. I've only set up one, had a little trouble  with one of the screws on set up. It's not going in the hole but I got tired of trying.<br/><br/>I plugged it in. Oh my gosh I love this quiet cold fan!  Hope the jenky screw holds because I am not giving this fan up.<br/><br/>I might buy more.
 I'm not sure why other people said it was hard to put together. You literally just have to screw on the base and you can do that with your fingers. The actual air that is blown is not super strong, even on the highest level, but it seems to blow out colder air, which is weird but welcomed. I think it is as good as any other fan. It looks nice and its slim design helps you to hide it in a corner so it can do its work.
 Just wow. I bought this fan because I'd snipped the power cable on my Sharper Image tower fan by accident. I haven't purchased a fan in years and had no idea how the field had improved or evolved. Trusting other Amazon reviewers to guide me, I snagged this Lasko, a name I'd never heard before, and my goodness this fan rules. I simply had to hop on here and review it because any one who might be skeptical shouldn't be. It's extremely quiet for a fan and it cools down my living room like you wouldn't believe. It will probably be a long while till I have to actually use my real air conditioner. I'm about 15 feet away and I can feel the air circulating throughout my entire main living area. Best fan I've ever owned and my parents are big Dyson fans. I've seen their top of the line fans in action and I would recommend this well over one of those. Support!
 I've now owned this tower fan for 3 months. I purchased it when the summer temperatures were approaching 110° and above and it exceeded expectations. My only issue is that it's just recently begun to make a grating noise. It's not constant, but it's beginning to do what a lesser quality tower fan that I owned did. When my other fan began to make this same sound, it wasn't long before it stopped working altogether. I hope this isn't the case with my Lasko 2554.
 I really had no idea what to expect with this fan  but in my opinion it works very very well. I  have no idea about the ionizer  but the fan does a great job of distributing air and cooling the room which is why I bought it. I know there are much more expensive fans out there and they may do a much better job but for my purposes, this works the way it's supposed to work. The remote is actually pretty handy to have as well.
 I purchased this to use in our bedroom where we do not have good air circulation in the evenings, and in Texas that is a necessity. I have used several other types of fans, and I read the reviews for this one before purchasing. I am extremely pleased with this fan and highly recommend it. The air flow is great at all three levels, and more than adequately cools the entire room. Some reviews state that it isn't sturdy. I found it to be as sturdy as all other tower fans and have had no issues. As with all fans, I would be careful around small children as I could see it tipping easily. I will be purchasing another one of these for my kitchen as well. If you are considering a fan, definitely consider this one!
 This is a strong fan that looks stylish in any room. It easily cools off a large bedroom, oscillates, and is quiet. The buttons feel a little cheap and sometimes when I press the power button it takes another push to work or activates the ion feature so I feel like the buttons do not 100% align with the proper controls. It was extremely easy to put together, I’m honestly confused how it would have been complicated for others but maybe they’ve adjusted the design. You just pop the base together and put in the screws, I did so without consulting the manual, it was that straight forward.
 I purchased this fan (and others) this summer in an attempt to survive a Southern California heat wavelik. My top-story, sun-facing apartment would trap heat like a sauna, and who wants to live out their days in a sauna. Thus began our search for climate control. I read review after review and brought home fan after fan, hoping each time that this would be the perfect fit - a space-efficient, budget-friendly, silent source of arctic chills. Some were returned, others remained at the apartment and became a sort of "fan army". On different surface levels, in all four corners of a room, we had a box fan, a standing oscillating fan, a Honeywell tower, this... I wish I could tell you this was the perfect one, but truth be told, it wasn't that great. However, this is not specific to this individual fan; all fans are going to be disappointing when your heart truly desires air conditioning!<br/><br/>So, relative to its counterparts in the fan army, this is why I believe this product is above average/worth the price:<br/>-although "quiet" might be a stretch, this was definitely "less loud" than others. TV volume goes up and ability to eavesdrop on other peoples' conversations goes down.<br/>-it oscillates. sweeps the room pretty good.<br/>-clean. for whatever reason, this might be the ionizing technology or it might just be that it has a weaker output, this fan had very little dirt or dust bunnies clinging to the back of it, whereas the standard white plastic low budget fans were constantly filthy<br/>-while the output of air coming out doesn't feel particularly forceful, it does however have a cool feel to it<br/><br/>So, if you're stuck choosing between fans, this model is a fine choice. Luckily for me, I had a friend with a spare portable LG airconditioner sitting in storage.
 The fan looks nice, but it's much louder than I expected. I expected it to be maybe slightly louder than your average ceiling fan, but that's not the case here. It's in my basement and I wanted a silent fan that doesn't interfere with the TV.  The remote control does not come with batteries, and it doesn't work very well unless you have a CLEAR line of site to the front of the fan. If it's oscillating and facing slightly away from you, it won't accept signals from the remote. Also, it has a rattling sound coming from the top of the tower that is pretty annoying. I doubt I will return it. Overall I give this an average score for being louder than expected, a possible build quality issue, and a finicky remote.
 I've been using this fan for a couple of months now and have found the performance very satisfactory. It generates a nice stream of air (3 speeds) is quiet and has a small footprint. I've had the fan on all night during hot and muggy nights and it is a lifesaver (I do not have air conditioning). It is really quiet and I have no problem sleeping with it on (and I am very sensitive to ambient noise). Seems well built and sturdy and does not vibrate or shake (as I have placed it on a raised surface with the fan on for an extended period of time). Satisfied with the product so far as it has done its job and it does get used frequently.
 The functionality is good but it's annoying to have on especially on the lowest setting, at which the hum is very audible. I ordered a replacement and the replacement's hum was even worse. Everyone who answered my question about the noise stated this is a very quiet fan so I'm confused if I'm more sensitive to the noise the fan makes or if I've gotten two duds. Hence the 3-star rating, which I will improve if the next replacement sounds like what I expect based on reviews and answers.
 We had three Lasko fans that looked like and had the same features as these.  We purchased two of these fans thinking they were the same as what we had, but they are not, even though they look very similar.  These are very noisy and vibrate (both of them).  The packaging was unbelievable, they were shipped in the display boxes that you see in the store.  Those boxes are made for displaying the product, not shipping it, so there is little protection.  That may be were the vibrating comes from!<br/><br/>I would not recommend  these fans!!!!!
 Fantastic!  Living in Texas where monthly electric bill and temperatures are always in the three digits, I have some experience with fans.<br/><br/>Actually blows cool air. I also used black electric tape to cover the blue lights for Ion/speed functions because I like complete darkness in my bedroom when I sleep (see photo).  Isn't super quiet like a Dyson Bladeless but I like white noise when I sleep. For other rooms, I don't think the noise level will be an issue - good trade-off for superior cooling and ion functionality.<br/><br/>Will be purchasing another for the living room.<br/><br/>Great price point and super speedy free shipping!
 I obviously have an older version of this fan since I bought it in 2014, but it’s by far the best fan I’ve ever had! It’s used daily in the spring and summer, and 4 years later it works as well as the first time I used it. I rarely ever need to put it on level 2 or 3 because of how strong it is. My mom purchased another Lasko model for roughly the same price, and it feels like a 4 year old blowing on your face from across the room LOL. I actually came on here tonight to purchase a second fan now that my son has his own room. Highly recommend this fan, you will absolutely get your money’s worth!
 I wouldn't give this 2 stars more like 2 1/2. But it's is what it is.  I'm not that happy with this version of the Lasko wind curve fan.  I previous owned the older version of the #2551 and I loved it.  I purchased the display model from Sears about 7 years.  It finally died on me this past winter .<br/><br/>I purchased this one because I assumed that this model would be just as satisfying.  Boy was I wrong.  For starters this fan Has some awkward noise.  It has this dull hum that annoys me while trying to fall asleep and interferes with the tv.  It's also has this clicking/rattling sound from the internal blades spinning around.<br/><br/>The remote is also very frustrating.  I have to literally wait until the fan is dead center with the remote before it will work.  Trying to control it while sleep is useless.  Sometimes I just say to hell with it and unplug the damn thing. With the last model I didn't even need to point the remote in the direction of the fan. In the middle of the night if I found myself too cold I could press a button from anywhere and control the functions.<br/><br/>I don't know what Lasko has done but,  they need to improve this model or at least make it comparable to its predecessor.<br/><br/>All this being said, I'll keep it because I'm tried of shopping for a decently priced oscillating, ionizing fan. The timer is a plus too.
 This fan is great for sleeping. It is the right amount of white noise without the choppiness of blades.  It is tall enough to be effective over a high mattress and the air actually reaches me.  The remote is really handy during the night.  The unit is light and easy to move and is very classy looking.  I have only used the Ion function during the day as the blue light is rather bright.  The small green light indicating the unit is on does not seem to be too bright at night.  I would absolutely purchase this again.
 I love this fan for multiple reasons.<br/><br/>Reason #1:  It requires very little space.  This was the factor I considered first when purchasing a fan because my apartment is basically wall to wall furniture with a few other things tossed in.  I also use a rollator (type of walker) so I needed to be able to put a fan in an area where I wasn't going to be bumping into it or running over the chord.<br/><br/>Reason #2:  It is quiet.  I use it in my bedroom when I am sleeping so this is an important factor.<br/><br/>Reason #3:  it is easy to clean!  If you have ever had a fan where you have to take the whole thing apart and then wash it, you will totally appreciate this fan!
 I bought this fan to keep cool while sleeping in the summer. However it is un-usable due to the noisey motor. After 5 min of use, it begins to make stuttering sound as if the spinning blades are softly hitting a piece of metal. At higher speeds, the sound gets higher pitch and is unbearable.<br/><br/>Absolutely do not buy this fan if you plan on sleeping with it on or have it near you while watching tv/talking with someone.
 ** Recommend **<br/>I like the looking it fit my home decor &amp; color style I have, wood-like panel in front plate, 3 speeds, rotate and non-rotate function. You can set a timer. I love this function I set it before going to bed or when reading a book and fall sleep on the sofa I do not to worry to wake up in the middle of the night to power it off before I catch a cold.<br/>It comes with a remote control that you put it in the back of the unit when not using it. It is work great for me so far.<br/><br/>I am giving this a "4" STARs. I have to ding one Star due to when using for a few weeks, when it on the rotating mode at high speed (level 3), it make "click......click......click.....click" noise when it reached each end of the rotation. it is a bit annoying if you happened to have that mood of the day that you really-really want Quite time in the house. That clicking noise will drive you mad. When that happened to me. I have it on non-rotate mode and I'm cool - literary and figuratively.<br/><br/>If you have music or TV on you might not hearing that clicking (much). But if you are sensitive to noise, this fan might not work for you.<br/><br/>Overall, I am keeping it and I am happy with it. Might get a another one for living room next summer so  I do not have to move it back and forth between bedroom and living room. :)
 I bought this fan for the second time because I already have one in the wood grain color from a while ago that works great. Anyway, as soon as I put this fan together and turned it on I was immediately disappointed. There is a loud electronic hum produced from the motor in my unit. If you use this fan in a quieter environment it will be very obvious and very annoying. Technically the fan works and blows air but I don't even want to turn it on because of the noise, and I certainly don't want to use it while I'm trying to sleep. I am not sure if I received a defective unit or if they are all like this now. Buyer beware.
 Love it, this fan is a beast. multiple settings, air direction control, timer... has everything you could ask for.... It has literally been running since it was delivered and have had no problems with it. I have to have the noise to sleep and it's perfect for that as well, we still haven't figured out what the Ionizer does but it does the job i wanted it for (which was to sleep at night) :)<br/><br/>Update 7/28/18 -- we've had this for two years now and its still running. Have not run into a a single issue. I would definitely but this again!
 Works great and easy to use!  Bought for my 11 year old daughter. Her room get's more sun than the rest of the house. She loves the remote and can control without getting out of bed.  Saves me money since she no longer adjusts the AC for the entire house just because her room is a little warm.<br/><br/>Ionizer is a nice feature to help keep her room smelling fresh. Tower design help minimize the impact in on the space since her room is a little small.
 This is the fourth one I’ve bought. I have 2 and bought 1 for my sister and 1 for dad. These fans are my favorite thing. I live in Florida and i don’t sleep without it. It worked perfect during the hurricane when we used our lasko fans for air when we lost power. These fans are strong!
 This thing is poorly designed. It has the shaft attached to a loose metal plate which rattles. It is not dampened so at low speeds you can very clearly hear it which makes a very annoying rattling sound. Impossible to sleep with and I can't imagine anyone being able to stand it during normal use.
 For some reason I thought it would be shipped in an Amazon box m, but it wasn't; it was also left on my front porch where someone could easily see what it was. I opened it all up the assembly was easy. I turned it on with the remote and the honestly it wasn't that strong on the highest setting. Then I go to turn it off on the tower and the power button is completely pushed in stuck. I could barely get it on or off. The box was also a little damaged. I wouldn't recommend.
 The fan came in a tall box that contained the fan, two base pieces, and 3 bags. One contained the manual, the other contained 4 screws that can be tightened by hand, and the third contained a remote. Once you remove the fan from the box, you will clip the two base pieces together. The base then screws into the bottom of the fan using the four screws. I found that putting it together was a little confusing but got it after awhile. The fan has 5 buttons. A power button, a swivel button, an ion button, a timer button, and a fan speed button. The buttons do not beep when they are pressed. The fan moves a good amount of air and the noise is perfect for that white noise effect. The swivel option is great when you don't want the air constantly on you all day. The remote works great for in the middle of the night when you don't want to get out of bed to turn off the fan. The fan also has an ION button option. I thought this was a great option to have on a fan for a bedroom that is located in the basement.<br/>Overall, Ive had this product for a month now and I am pleased with every single aspect of it and would recommend this to people looking for a bedroom fan not only used for cooling down but, for white noise as well.
 This fan works so much better than you could ever imagine. At times you need a blanket it works so well. Definitely work the money and is made of quality standards.
 I only received this yesterday but so far I love it, we live in a half double so our windows all just hit walls even with the ac going is mainly just going towards a wall. Our upstairs is unbearable in the summer time even on cool rainy days we have to run the ac bc it's way too hot and stuffy not too. Window fans don't really work for us bc like I said it just hits a wall up and downstairs so this was absolutely perfect they definitely hit the nail on the head when they described the breeze to be like sitting next to a body of water and the air coming off. That is exactly what It is.<br/><br/>So far I'm satisfied exactly what we needed
 It does the job!  Larger than I expected and powerful. I have been lowering my a/c as I live in Florida and found that the whole house was cool except for my bedroom.  Hopefully using this fan now allows me to have the a/c higher (so will save me money). Did not arrive in product box and did not have the remote holder on the back.  I paid $20 more than elsewhere though....<br/><br/>Addendum:  I purchased a second one of these and did a google search to find the lowest price - I paid $64 (with tax) for this one, but was able to get one with Free shipping from ivahouse.com for $43.97 plus it came in the original box and came with the back groove to hold the remote.. shipped in two days.
 I’ve had other brands of these oscillating tower fans and most of them had one function or another fail within the first year or two. This is my second Lasko as my other one has worked flawlessly and quietly without fail since the day I bought it. In my opinion Lasko makes the best fans hands down. My first was a 5-speed but only the 3-speeed was available this time but other than that it has all the other functions of my first one. My wife and I love them both. 5-Stars all the way for me.
 I purchased this fan to help cool my office since all the computers seem to keep the room a bit warmer than the rest of the house. Sitting this just outside the door in the always cool hallway did the trick, moves plenty of air is non-obtrusive. If you are wanting the ION feature, forget about it as it's pretty much useless. All was good for just about 14 months when I looked over and noticed that no air was coming from the fan and yet all the lights were on. The fan motor was not turning, but everything else still worked (oscillation, ionizer for what it's worth, etc.). Go figure it just a couple months out of warranty. After initially thinking that the motor was probably burned up I set off looking for a new fan and reading the reviews. Disappointed that I really could not find anything that looked like it would work as well as the 2554 I decided to dig into it to see if I could find out what really happened to it.<br/>20 to 30 some screws later I had it apart and was inspecting all components. Could not find anything that looked burnt or out of place. This got me to thinking about all those hairdryers that quit just because the thermal fuse had blown and I started my hunt for those little bastards in this device. The typical thermal fuse does not reset after it trips and therefore keeps power from getting to the motor. After only finding the little fuse on the circuit board (which was good) I did some Googling and found a reference to the thermal fuse located inside the motor housing.<br/>Taking the four screws off the motor housing and pulling it apart revealed that all the incoming wires were wrapped with black heat shrink tubing where they connect to the motor winding wires. The red and the white wire are joined inside the heat shrink tubing with the culprit thermal fuse. Replacing the fuse corrected the problem and my fan is now back and working well.<br/><br/>Note: be very careful cutting the black heat shrink tubing off as the tiny motor winding wire would be easy to cut. After removing the tubing, cut out the old thermal fuse and solder a new one to the old remaining leads. Have some heat shrink tubing on hand to put in place so you can finish it off right, after soldering in the new thermal fuse.<br/>I picked up a thermal fuse from Radio Shack for a couple bucks (288°F (140°C) Thermal Protector Fuse). I suppose you could just remove it all together, but I wouldn't recommend it.<br/><br/>I think the quality of the motor and other parts are good, but these thermal fuses are notorious for failing in all kinds of devices. I'm guessing that is why you can get them at Radio Shack.<br/><br/>Good Luck.
 I only gave this 4 stars because I just received this fan yesterday April 17th 2014 &amp; I am writing a quick review now but will update it when we get out of SPRINTER (The new Season that we have now) &amp; finally get some warm/ hot summer weather.<br/><br/>It was very easy to put the base on &amp; then was already to go. Since my NYC apt still has the heat going I used it at night when I went to sleep &amp; it kept my bedroom very cool. It was also quiet on the highest one. I hope it does the same in the Summer. As for the blue light, I love my bedroom very dark &amp; even sleep with an eye mask on. The light is bright but when I got up in the middle of the night, &amp; took off my eye mask it was kind of good so I can see my way out of the room. It is kind of like having a night light in your room. I def like this fan compared to a window fan or those other stand ups. Will keep you posted as the months go on.
 I bought this fan to replace my last one that died (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EJO1GRO?). Before it finally kicked the bucket, it had been making a lot of squeaking noises as it oscillated, and I bought this one because it seemed sturdier and had far fewer complaints in that respect. Mostly, this fan is just "meh".<br/><br/>First of all, the box this fan shipped in was the original, and it was broken/torn upon arrival. Luckily, none of the pieces were broken. Second, the fan itself is fairly weak--the "high" setting on this one is about the same as the "low" setting on my last one. It does move a little bit of air, but it does nothing to cool the room down (for reference, I use it in my bedroom which is fairly small--only about 10'x10'). Third, the oscillating range is extremely limited--it seems to only move about 30-40 degrees at best. Finally, the ION light is, indeed, fairly bright at night, but since I don't notice a difference with the ION setting on, I just keep it off.<br/><br/>Overall, if returning it weren't such a hassle (I'd've had to have bought a new box to ship it back in) and if summer weren't almost over, I'd've sent it back and gotten a new fan. For now, it should be (barely) enough to allow me to sleep at night as the weather cools down.
 For months, I have been arguing with my son because he wants to keep the house freezing cold while the rest of the family is wearing every piece of clothing they owe to keep warm enough. No more!! I bought him this fan and I am so happy I did. His bedroom is freezing cold, just the way he likes it while the rest of the family can enjoy a warm house. This fan is surprisingly quiet and it is really powerful. It has 4 different options for power and even option 3 keeps his slightly above average size bedroom really cold. The fan also looks really nice.Thank you!
 My office building, like Dante's Inferno, has different circles with very different climate systems.  The inner circle of the building is frigid.  The outer circle, where I reside, remains so warm that I could simmer a quality gumbo on my desk.  Fortunately the Lasso does a decent job redirecting the icy air from the interior hellscape toward my desk, which allows me to work without sweating through my desk chair.  The remote control means I don't have to step up from diligently crafting quality work product to adjust settings.  It's quite quiet at the lower setting and when fully cranked creates a healthy flow like a pleasant beach breeze on a cool morning.
 Great tower fan for the price. I use this primarily to keep my hand dry when using my computers mouse, especially when I'm gaming. It works very well and is quiet on the lowest setting, a bit loud on the highest but that is to be expected. It has a nice sleek design that matches almost any room and comes with two color options. Options include oscillation, ionizer, timer and three different speeds. Even though one of these fans died on me I still like the fan because it has many options and keeps me cool. Overall a wonderful fan. Only knock i have against it is that I can not clean the grate of cat hair and dust buildup.
 Nice. Tall oscillates, and nifty remote.<br/>I would have given it 5 stars except for two things I dislike:<br/>1) No directions. While pretty simple to attach the base I have two small screws that I am at a loss where they go.<br/>2) Packing.  No internal padding at all, however, I was lucky in that mine had some trash in the box. Greasy paper, a used cheap napkin, and even a dirty toothpick. I guess some poor worker in China had to eat while working.
 Terrific fan, powerful and quiet. The only complaint I have is the dazzling bright blue light that comes on when you turn on the ionizing feature. Under most circumstances, this likely wouldn't be a problem. However, we use it in our bedroom at night and it literally acts as a nightlight, which we don't need or want. Also, it's not a simple matter of taping over the light since it shines 'around' the tape and is still quite bright. If there was a way to turn off the lights, it'd get a 5 star.
 Nice quite fan but doesn't oscillate very much.. maybe about  60ﾟ .... not good for a big room. Weird cause its a pretty big fan.  Most oscillating fans oscillate at least half way..  90ﾟto 180.  Also small tab  on remote control  That lets you hang it on the back of unit came broken already
 Very WEAK! Highest setting feels more like low/medium. There is no way to tell if the iON is working other than the blue light on the front. There are no visibal iON fields/electricity. Overall, it is quiet but it just didn’t have the strength I wanted for “high”. Ossilates ur BARELY. It’s like 2 inches to the left and then 2 inches to the right. It’s just not worth the price. For what it is, it should be about $20 bucks. For over $50, I expected a way better product.
 If you are looking for the perfect fan get this one.  I read reviews for a least a week before making my purchase, because I didn't have money to waste on a fan that didn't do its job, but I am very happy with my choice.  Love the fresh air ionizer and it keeps my living room and kitchen perfectly cool. I live in an older building in San Fran and even w/ with the normally cooler temps and my windows open, my apartment was very stuffy.  Its perfect now.  I still keep one window open just so fresh air is circulating at all times, but the fan handles all my cooling needs.  I have one in front room and then one in my bedroom.  Its very tall.  Not sure if you understand inches.  I didn't so when it came I was shocked by how tall it was.
 We really like this fan. We've had it for 3 years now. The only reason for a 4 star is because it turned on by itself and now it doesn't turn off. We unplug it to turn it off. Must be a wiring issue now. Other than that, it's been great. Get's the air moving and the air ionizer seems to cool the air of just a bit.
 I was very happy with these fans for the 3 months that they actually worked (I ordered two fans).  In January, month 5 after purchasing, I tried to turn on both fans, but neither worked. Seems like the motors wore/burned out in both. Very strange. I called Lasko customer service and Lasko agreed to replace both fans and honor the 1-year warranty. However, Lasko claimed that my particular model was no longer available (even though Amazon still sells them), so they sent me two lower-cost and LOUDER fans as replacements. I would advise anyone to NOT buy this model. I’m also so disappointed with Lasko warranty 🙁
 I LOVE this fan! Its quiet, it has a remote, a timer AND  a remote. Ok, so I realize I sounded a little lazy with that last one, but late nights, sometimes I dont want to get out of bed and the remote makes it easy fore me to stay comfortable in bed while turning my fans ion setting on.<br/>Its a pretty big fan. But thats another reason why I love it so much. When you first get it, yoy have to assemble the stand on it. Not gonna lie, it took me a good 10-15 mins to put it on correctly, but I think that was mainly my fault. Read the instructions people. Thats why it comes with them.
 Product is just as described. Arrived safely packaged. Assembly took less than 10 minutes. The fan is quiet, even on its highest speed, and powerful, even on its lowest speed. The base is sturdy and the fan appears to be well made. Worth every penny during the hot Texas summers.<br/><br/>Update 6/10/2015 - A year later and the fan is still working great! It's still quiet and powerful. Seriously a lifesaver during the hot summers. I highly recommend. Also, a note to the people who have difficulty with the remote - we have figured out that the remote needs to be pointed directly at the fan. It's not as sensitive as some remotes. It can be challenging to use it since the fan oscillates, but you just have to wait for the fan to come back towards you.
 I purchased this fan in May 2018, nice looking, kept my room cool and was quiet.  Fast forward 3 months and I’m ready to toss it.  It started making noise and it’s even worse when it oscillates.  I have to turn the tv up to combat the noise from the fan.  I should have bought the ozieri fan I originally had.  Huge disappointment!  I do not recommend this fan and I would return if I could!!
 +<br/>Looks like a decepticon esp when it oscillates; really like the design<br/>Easy to use<br/>Super easy to assemble the base<br/>Functional<br/>Lowest setting blows out ample cool air (when not too humid)<br/>Takes up little space, despite being taller than expected<br/>Mostly quiet, esp in larger rooms<br/>Smooth operation so far<br/>Remote works well long as it's pointed in the direction of the fan's sensor<br/>Pretty lightweight and easy to carry bc it has a place for your hand under the top<br/><br/>-<br/>Less than a week in, I noticed rattling when I turn it on/off<br/>There's sometimes a very light knock while it's on<br/>It's quieter than my other fan but not as quiet as I hoped, esp in a smaller room<br/>The two screws don't fit in the base (fan stable w/o them)<br/>Cleaning doesn't look like it'll be an easy task<br/>Limited adjustment to the vent<br/>Doesn't cover as wide an area as advertised but enough for my small living area<br/>The blue ion light is really bright, lights up a small dark room<br/><br/>Overall I like this fan. Compared the height to my 6' tree.<br/>First fan arrived damaged with a crack, chipped piece and depressed buttons...of course Amazon replaced it without issue. I plan on buying another for my bedroom.
 Originally I purchased 2 of these fans and they were shipped separately. So I was able to cancel the second fan. Even at the highest setting it is no match for the Honeywell fan with filter. The reason I went with lasko was price and Honeywell jumped it price from 59.99 last September to 79.99 and then again to 84.99  If you can wait til Sept I sure the prices will go down check  and  keep checking that is what I will be doing because even on it lowest setting it gives a more powerful breeze.<br/>I use the Lasko in the evening  depending on where you set it up may made the different but my bed is against a wall and I hate having a steady breeze on me all night. So it on timer for the longest 4hrs as Honeywell offers 6hrs and a temp setting.
 I bought one of these Lasko fans a while back and ended up giving it to my daughter, who loves it! I missed having one of my own so I ordered a 2nd one!<br/>I love the choices ~ fan? AC? YES!! various speeds from which to choose? YES! timer? YES!<br/>There is everything to love about this thing...especially if you also own one of their space heaters (which I do) ~ this was a no-brainer purchase. :)<br/>FIVE STARS*****
 We have central air conditioning but we sleep upstairs and the vents are very small. When the weather isn't hot enough for the air conditioner it gets hot so we bought this fan. It has not disappointed! It is the perfect accompaniment to the air when it struggles to push enough air out upstairs. This always works perfectly when it's not hot enough to turn on the air but muggy. We read the reviews and we're sold on the fan. It is quiet which fools you into thinking it won't work but sit back and relax and feel the breeze.
 This fan is simply amazing! My other tower fan died bc it was old, so I wanted a good quality tower fan with a remote this time.  This fan delivered!! The air is slightly cooled when blown; which is fantastic! It has 3 speeds as to how hard the wind blows, and they are at great intervals of force!! The remote is simple, yet it covers all the bases for the fan : power, speed, osculate, and the ionizer.  love this fan so much!!<br/><br/>Over a year later and still going strong!  We use it daily in the summer, and it still is fantastic!<br/><br/>Over two years now, and it still works great!!
 Quiet fan but even on high not the air flow you would expect from such a large fan.  It is quite large so make sure to measure correctly or you will end up with a abnormally large fan in a small spot.  The plastic is attractive.  As for the ionizer I am not sure this is actually doing anything because I don't see or smell any change in air quality.  Overall a large medium airflow fan (even on highest setting).
 Window for return has just passed. Fan has one speed now, Slow. After reading the other reviewers, I felt it was important to add to my review  that mine suddenly got a smell of burning ( electrical) also.  I opted for the warranty, I usually don't and hopefully it will not be a hassle to use it. It is a big unit, came in a big long box.<br/>It is a nice looking fan, but who cares. It does not last, and it is impossible to clean. They do offer a cover for the back of this unit just another $25.00.  I purchased a fan at Aldi's grocery store approx. 5 years ago for half the price and this was a replacement for that one.
 I really love this fan. We have had it for about a week and it works great and looks beautiful. It is great for space-starved areas. It doesn't make a tremendous amount of noise - just the right amount IMO for a little white noise for sleeping. Love that there's a remote to it and that the ion feature can be turned on or off. The blue light IS very bright, however as others have suggested, a little piece of electrical tape takes care of that just fine. It is a bit top heavy, as another user mentioned - and is the reason I docked a star from the review. My toddler is easily able to push it over so we have to be extra careful when he is around it. For child-free homes, I wouldn't anticipate it falling over too easily though.
 The fan arrived on time and in good condition.  Unpacking and assembly of the base to the fan was simple.  The fan is taller that my previous unit which allows for everyone seated to feel the breeze. The adjustable louver is nice for aiming the airflow up or.down. The woodgrain panel is a nice touch to blend into my decor. My only criticism is the brightness of the blue LED indicating the ozone option is on is very intense.  Nine and quiet even when oscillating.
 Powerful fan that takes up a small footprint. Perfectly sized to aim over my high bed, and powerful enough to reach across the bedroom. The remote helps for when I'm too lazy to get up and change the settings. I live in Florida with no central air, and wall units do a poor job of moving air around. This fan (especially the ion function) helps keep air moving and does make it feel cooler.
 There seems to be a SIGNIFICANT drop in quality with these fans. It breaks my heart to say so. I've had many of these fans over the years and currently have 6, including one in each camper.  People USED TO BE impressed with how effective, low profile , elegant and quiet they are. No More, sad to say.  The last two fans I have received have had significant mechanical whine at all speeds, and increased fan speed only compounds the problem between mechanical whine and noisy wind sound.... you can't carry on a conversation, which was not previously the case.  I don't understand a company that would take such a clearly successful product and just simply ruin it.  I'm very disappointed, as I use these fans everywhere and have recommended them so highly.  Now I will have to tell everyone just the opposite.
 Inopted for the silver one with the imitation wood accents I have had this fan for a few weeks now and so far it’s been great. It looks great on my living room and so far performs quietly and does a nice job cooling off our room. All three power levels are surprisingly more quiet than I expected. The remote and timer are nice features as well and the air freshener. I read a few reviews on it explaining how it is louder and noisier than advertised and so far this has not been the case for me. I hope this fan remains durable and the motor performs this way for a long time. My only negative is that I wish it would oscillate more of an angle but Im being quite picky here. If this fan remains as quiet and power as it is I will be happy!
 This is the by far the best fan we have purchased. We have 4, all different brands, hoping to find a decent one and this one is it. It blows out super cool air and keeps our sons room nice and not feeling so muggy. Definitely planning on buying another one shortly!
 Excellent tower fan by Lasko.  It cools my room (12'x13') much better than my expensive fan by Dyson.<br/>However, the Lasko fan is much more difficult to clean than the Dyson bladeless fan.<br/>Looks like my Lasko fan doesn't allow you to take out the filter or blades for cleaning, so my Dyson fan is going to last much longer.<br/>This Lasko fan is also much quieter than my Dyson fan when comparing a similar amount of air flow.
 Beautiful fan that works like advertised. Very quiet yet powerful! I like it very much especially the ION function that keeps my office smell fresh all the time.
 I was quite surprised by the power of this fan, I'm impressed.  I was looking for a traditional style fan with the bigger blades as I'm with the school of thought 'if it ain't broke don't fix it', but this Lasko fan has won me over.  I just didn't think a tower fan of these style could move enough air but it does.  The remote is a definate plus... if there is a down side it's that the housing has the look and feel of cheap plastic because that's what it is.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Moves good amount of air<br/>Very quiet<br/>Remote<br/>Nice design, fits in well in any room<br/>Very light &amp; portable<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Cheap plastic materials<br/>Remote could have better range
 Picked up this fan based on several reviews stating it was the quietest among the choices. Well I must say that it is NOT the quietest. It has an electrical hum which may be the wiring in my twenty year old house. But the fan itself makes a lot of noise just from the motor turning. The quietset is less noisy. This does provide very cold air when it blows, plus an ionizer feature. Both features I find very handy and therefore gave an additional star. The design of the unit is very good attempt to be elegant as well. This my wife appreciates very much. The remote work excellent and is another handy must have feature for this caliber product.<br/><br/>Overall: Good product but there's better if you are looking for the most quiet fan.
 My fan came assembled and I'm using it for my patio where I smoke cigars. It's super quiet and moves air nicely! The six screws were easy to install and the base is good. The three speeds are adequate and the oscillation is doesn't add any noise as with some fans. The remote looks flimsy, but works well. No complaints for the price... A solid purchase for a fan.
 I finally had to replace my 10 year Lasko Tower Fan.  I was hoping this one would be just as good and to my surprise it’s better.  This one is quieter as a fan but changing fan speeds, oscillation, on/off now make now sound.  My old one beeped with every change.  Now nice silence.  I always sleep with a fan for the breeze and white noise and this fan still delivers!!
 Was looking for a tower fan with a remote control so I could set it up and use it from my bed on the hot summer nights.  The fan is powerful and relatively quiet sure, but the remote control doesn't work very well.  Pointing directly at it, I can press the power button multiple times.  It'll only register once I walk up to it and almost get within arm's reach.  This is pretty damned terrible.  I've got a standing Honeywell fan that I bought over 13 years ago and 1) the fan is more powerful and 2) the remote control has always worked very well from any distance.  I should have bought another one of those.<br/><br/>Skip this fan.  I regret not getting another Honeywell.
 I bought this fan based on reviews that this fan is super quiet, and maybe I have high standards but frankly I'm not super impressed with the noise level throughout the speeds. I can still fall asleep with the fan on, but I've had cheaper Wal-Mart brands that were as effective with less noise.<br/><br/>Oscillating angle range seems a bit narrow but I'm not going to break out the protractor and lay it out for you all. It feels tight around 90.<br/><br/>Also I feel like the lowest speed setting isn't that low, but I haven't owned many tower fans so that may just be indicative of fans in general.<br/><br/>Before you abandon all hope thou, this fan does have a good set of features, very distinguishable setting lights so you can use remote at a distance and know what you're adjusting, and good air flow.
 I received this item early, and in great condition. Assembling the stand was quick and easy, so I had it up and running within 10 minutes of receiving the fan. I love that it is also really easy to figure out how to function the fan, especially with the remote, with or without instructions. Once I turned it on in my room, I was delighted by how cold the air was that was pushed out of the fan. Along with how clean it smelt, compared to the air previously. Since I live in a room with a cat, and it's litter box (since there isn't much space for it elsewhere), the air is of course on the lamentable side. Yet with the fan it honestly smells a lot cleaner, and gives me the satisfaction of having cool air during the summer heat without owning an Air Conditioner. I have only had it for a couple days, so I can't say too much on it. But I am already in love with this product.
 I'm so old school that when I think of a fan i think of something round (or square) with three or four blades spinning. I didn't really expect anything in this form factor to really send cool air across the room like it does. I was wrong. This beauty is quiet and really cools you. Haven't tried the ionizer yet but i'm very impressed with this tower fan.
 I want to love this fan and for the first week I did. Then, it began making a weird noise during the night while it is on. I've made sure it's clean and the noise still happens. I like the three speed options, but on the lowest setting the noise occurs. Unfortunately, I don't feel this fan will last even a year. The blue light for air purifying is very bright, so I don't advise using the purifier feature at night. I do like having the purifying feature though!
 Great fan.  We have had ours for about four months. I don’t know how it makes the air feel so cool without air-conditioning but it is pretty impressive. It is quiet for a fan. It’s just a low ambient noise. We use ours in the bedroom and it’s no problem sleeping. Highly recommend. Would buy again!  we even run this fan in the winter instead of a ceiling fan. It has a modern look takes up a small amount of room.  Love it
 This fan has almost no difference between the lowest and highest settings - all are weak! I won't even buy another fan of this type as this was to be a replacement for a similar one that worked great for about a year then became horribly noisy. Back to old-fashioned round fans for me.
 This fan has 3 speed settings. The lowest setting is just perfect (for me in the air conditioning) to keep me cool while sitting or sleeping. The highest setting is great for when you come in from outside. The remote is fantastic. I can control every option, power, speed, rotation, timer, and ion. I can sit in my chair and change the speed when I get cooled down, it is great. (It is great to be able to be so lazy I don't have to get up, technology is great.)<br/><br/>To those that complain about the noise...it is a fan. It isn't as quiet as an air blade, but it is much quieter than my window fan. And it is quieter than my previous upright fan. It makes noise but it is moving a lot of air.<br/><br/>It is taller than the other tower fans I've seen and purchased from the big box stores. This allows me to get a breeze across the top of my king size pillow top bed. My previous fan was not as tall as my bed.<br/><br/>It looks classy. Gray with black and wood grain trim.<br/><br/>It rotates about 75-80 degrees. So not a full 90 degrees. That's the only reason I took 1 star away. I shouldn't fault it. I haven't seen any fan that really rotates more than 90 degrees. But it would be really cool to have one that turns 180 degrees.  But I'm happy with this 75-80 degrees of rotation. It is enough to cool both me and my wife sitting in the living room.<br/><br/>I have another brand of tower can in he kitchen, when it dies, I'll be replacing it with this one.
 I personally love the fan, I use it every night to help me go to sleep. It has a perfect temperature and speed and is overall very easy to use.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that when the fan rotates it makes a squeaky kind of noise. I'm not sure if my fan is defective or all of them make this noise. It may seem like a small complaint but when you are trying to sleep and hear a squeak every 10 seconds when it rotates, it will drive you mad. So unfortunately I can't rotate it when I sleep and must keep the fan on me which is sometimes annoying. I'm interested to see if anyone else gets this annoying squeak when it rotates.
 This thing probably deserves 5 stars from me, but it just started making a squeaking sound after running 3.5 years pretty much non-stop; we are looking at buying another one cuz that’s pretty impressive. It still works but it may be getting close to not working anymore. We’ll see.
 This is a fairly powerful unit.  I keep it in my office because periodically the air conditioning in this building seems to put out stale and muggy air, and this allows me to keep working.  The oscillating feature is nice, not because I like to have the air blow back and forth, but because I can use the remote control to aim the fan and then halt it in that position (either blowing at me or blowing off to one side) as I need to.<br/><br/>I should add that the remote control is nice.  I can just aim it over my shoulder to turn the fan on or offf without really having to interrupt my work at the computer.<br/><br/>This fan seems to me powerful enough to handle a much larger room than my office.  I use it at the lowest speed.  It seems to be well-constructed and it is not obnoxiously loud (at least at the low speed).  It sounds like a fan -- what can I say?<br/><br/>Some very minor assembly was required to fasten the vertical part to the base, but I was up and running in only a few minutes after opening the box.
 My fan was delivered on June 29th. Assembly was easy enough. The remote has not worked since day 1 which wasn’t necessarily  a deal breaker. All 3 speeds are practically the same. Fan was pretty quiet at first but the last few day I am hearing a weird noise from within the fan that sounds like the motor may be going out. There is also a slight clicking noise when the fan rotates. Both sounds are bearable during the day but at night they can be pretty irritating. This is when the remote would come in handy I guess, if it were working!  Considering I have been using the fan for barley 30 days and I’m already experiencing issues I can’t say I would recommend this product. To be fare I have not contacted the manufacturer or Amazon with my issues as for the price I’m not sure it’s even worth the hassle.
 I received the original order in a opened box and got a replacement. The replacement came with brand new condition yesterday. Very easy to put together and the noise is very minimum, as well as 3 speed adjustments. I love the remote control function.
 I had a hard time deciding which fan to purchase. I'm glad I went with this one. I didn't want all the different setting for temperate, wind speed and wind pattern. It's just excessive. This one has 3 fan setting at a push of a button. Feels sturdy. I've been using it every day this summer and usually just leave it on all day to circulate the air in my room and haven't had any issues. It's not super quiet but its about what you would expect from any fan. No issues sleeping with it on.
 My wife and I use this for white noise and the breeze in the bedroom at night. We like it to rotate all the time at night to circulate the air, and turn it off during the day. The fan is of good quality, you get what you pay for and it is reasonably priced. However a huge oversight by the manufacturer was to have the settings be forgotten every time you toggle the power. Upon turning back on, one must also turn the Ionizer or the Rotate setting back on as well. An extra step every time, not big deal, but annoying. Obvious oversight.
 I ordered the black one and I absolutely love it. It is extremely quiet compared to tower fans I’ve owned previously. Even on level 1 it creates a good breeze and on level 3 it is so strong I usually turn it off or turn it down because I get too cold. Is as equally quiet on level 3 as it is on level 1. The remote for it is slim and easy to use. I am thinking about buying a second one for another room in the house.
 This tower fan works great in our 110 degree Fahrenheit summer, desert heat! It won't cool the house independently under those conditions, but it's a great boost to the AC unit. Im sure it's saving on my bill as I type. I love the remote control and rotate function. Even better is the ionizer. I live with 2 dogs (one puppy and one senior), so it can get smelly..even after Ive cleaned u<br/>the floor. The ionizer in this unit worked to de-funkify (yes, Im making that a word) my entire home in a short amount of time. It was so efficient that a friend who can smell a rose bloom a state away walked into my home and asked if I had gotten rid of the oldest dog!!! She couldn't smell him. Also worked for keeping the air clean while a smoking friend was visiting. No residual odor.
 Oh my good lord. I bought this fan as a replacement to an old Lasko tower fan that just wasn't putting out air like I wanted it to, and let me tell you, I am not looking back. Set up was simple, and when we plugged this baby in, I fell in love with it immediately. The output of air is great. I get really hot at night and keep it on setting 3, which is strong enough it blows my hair back. When taking the amount of air coming out of the fan into consideration, I would say that the noise of the fan is relatively normal to low. To the reviewers saying that it's huge, it's a TOWER fan. It is the normal size of a tower fan, and I'm very pleased with it. I haven't used the remote simply because I keep the fan right beside my bed at night, but there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it. I've had this fan about a week now, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to get a fan.
 I so much needed an elegant fan for our bedroom that had to be quiet and effective.  This fan works a treat!  I love the three quiet speeds and the choice of rotation or stand-still.  Although it has a timer, I don't use it because I enjoy the use of this fan all the time. It keeps our room fresh and cool all day and night.  I say 'night' because the fan is so quiet it is easy to sleep with the fan stayed on.<br/><br/>I hope that you have found my opinion to be helpful with your decision process to purchase this item. If this is the case, and where Amazon asks if this review helpful, please click "yes". Thank you!
 This fan does a great job cooling down my bedroom. I have no AC in my house since I live in an area that doesn't usually get hot but this year it's been hotter than normal, so I purchased this fan. At night I just open the windows and turn on the fan. I usually only have it on the lowest setting at night and I still feel it all the way across the room. Plus it's quiet! My fiance hated our old circular fan because of the noise but he never complains about this one.<br/>The timer feature is really nice so that I don't wake up at 5 am feeling like it's winter. The lights on it don't bother me, my DirecTV box has a brighter light than the fan.
 I love this fan! I have owned this exact model since 2007! It finally gave out this year and I had to buy another fan, and the choice was clear. This thing is very durable and has survived a number of falls, the Arizona desert, several moves and kept on ticking.
 I read reviews of this fan concerning the quietness, and took a chance. I can tell you it is is QUIET. The higher settings are a little less, but you can barely hear this fan running on low, and the circulated air is cool.Four stars are for the subtle hummmm that I hear on medium and high settings. Easy assembly, a screwdriver for two small screws, and the other four are placed in large holes and turned by hand. Packaging was simple and smart. No complaints. Lasko will be my go to for fans!
 This is the best fan I have ever purchased! We live in hot weather and don't have celing fans in our house and there is only so much ac can do! I can now play with the kids and cook in the kitchen and not get to hot! Our doen stairs is about 500 sqft and it keeps the whole thing cooled!
 We purchased this fan for use in our bedroom, which tends to get a little hot and stuffy.  Now that we have had it for about 6 months I don't like to go to sleep without it.  It has a very soothing sound which helps drown out noise, it helps my husband (who works nights) stay asleep during the day even if the kids are playing or I am vacuuming.  We also like the fact that it rotates throughout the night since then it doesn't freeze you when it's on you but still gives you a cool breeze from time to time.  I would purchase this item again if the one we have broke, since I don't think either my husband or I would like to go without it now.
 This is not a noisy machine.  It is quieter than many other fans I've ever owned.  I love these newer towers that look sleek and modern, take up little space, and perform well.  It has broad range of movement when oscillating.  When on high speed, it powerfully moves the air.  Remember that fans don't cool; they only move air.  When the skin is wet, the air movement evaporates the skin moisture, which makes the skin feel cooler.<br/><br/>I bought this machine, because of my past good experiences with Lasko products and because I run on the treadmill in my basement and need some air movement to keep me from overheating.  I bought the tallest tower available, because towers can't be canted up or down and because I wanted more than my legs to have air blown on them.
 It's a great fan. The unit I had came with small scuffs and scratches, but that's from the manufacturer and barely noticeable unless you're setting it up for the first time. The fan is quiet enough that I don't find it too distracting. I've been using it everyday since summer started and I have notice that it has begun to make a tiny rattling noise on occasion, but you would never notice it unless you pay close attention. It has a nice Ionizer option. My wife seems to sneeze less with it on compared to other fans that we had. It's not the strongest fan on the market, but it does the job. I'm happy with this purchase.
 Good quality fan for the money.  What a Godsend it is for this time of year.  We live by the beach and it has been extra muggy this year.  The cooler air being blown in our direction, along with the oscillating function has a very soothing effect, and makes the night-time hours much more conducive for sleep.  Two thumbs up.  Would buy again.
 I have a large bedroom with no air conditioner and this is a great addition. It cools the whole room. It's tall enough that it hits me when I'm on my tall bed. The remote is perfect for when I'm in bed and being lazy. The ionizer is a nice feature. The blue light can be pretty bright so if you need a dark room when you sleep, you'll want to turn that off.
 Well worth the research. I read the inputs from many of the reviewers. There was one review in particular I found very useful, ad the reviewer compared three similar products, all of which I was considering. The bottom line was that this product was less expensive, consumed less power, and provided the same features as the other two fans.<br/><br/>I am NOT disappointed in the least. This fan is awesome if you're looking for something to keep you cool at night. It is - for all intents and purposes - silent. Yet, on it's lowest speed it provides a comprehensive flow of air over two people, a dog, and a cat on a California King size bed, and this is without using the oscillation feature.<br/><br/>A brilliant choice, from a reputable supplier.
 Bought this and it worked great for a few days, nice and quiet. Within a week, it had an incredibly annoying rattling noise every time it was turned on. God only knows how bad it would have been after a year. I returned it, but had already disposed of the original box. Cost me $26 to get a new box at the UPS store. Really disappointing to pay $26 essentially to rent this for a week.
 Good fan...I've had it for about a week and am satisfied with it.  However, I wish it was quieter.  I read many reviews giving this fan high praise for being quiet but even at low the sound is still quite noticeable.  The amount of air it blows is impressive as even on the low setting, it really blows!  In that regard, I wish there were more speed settings then maybe the fan can be quieter on a lower setting.  It really seems like the lowest setting should be more of a medium.  As for the ionizer, I'm keeping my hopes up for it...hard to tell if it really works but over time hopefully it becomes more evident.
 Our old bedroom hundred+ dollar tower fan with remote, ions, and oscillation died last winter, so we looked all over town for a replacement.  Nothing was available that came close to our failed fan in looks or functionality, so I checked the web as well with little success.  Then I received a suggestion from Amazon for this Lasko model, which looked great, had all the same functionality, and was on sale for $48.  I read the indifferent reviews with the usual "it's great" and "it's terrible" ratings with some trepidation, but summer was fast approaching, and the price was definitely right, so decided to give it a chance.<br/><br/>So far, it's definitely been a winner.  The faux wood plastic trim fits in well with our bedroom furniture, the remote is perfectly sized for the nightstand (about 10 feet to the fan), it's quiet, and everything works as advertised.  I have to say I've been very pleased with the purchase so far, and heartily recommend it.  Over the two days I thought it over, the sale price jumped all over the place, so I was very happy to get it at the $48 price.  Concerning the poor review that said the remote had no range, I have to disagree, but the fan's remote sensor is on the front of the fan, so it must be pointed toward you.<br/><br/>The item arrived UPS in its unrepacked retail packaging and was expectedly scuffed, but the interior was undamaged and the fan has continued to work fine over the initial three weeks it's been in use.  The 7 1/2 hour shutoff timer is a bit tedious, requiring you to press the timer button multiple times until the four lights reflecting the 1/2, 1, 2, and 4 hour time periods add up to your selection, and beeps with each button press, so plan to set it while your partner is awake, or you'll regret it.  The ions option lights up, but unlike my Sharper Image silent air purifier and ionizer, produces no distinctive ozone odor, so I can't say how effective it is.  To be fair, my last fan's ions function didn't produce any odor either.<br/><br/>I couldn't be happier with the fan so far.  It's well worth a try.
 The AC in my apartment doesn't properly circulate air flow, so this is probably one of the best purchases I have made on Amazon. It lets you time how long it stays on, if it oscillates or not, inclues fan strength and even has an ionizer. It is large but doesn't feel bulky and is stylish in its design. I have reccomended this product to several people, and I epuld reccomend it to anyone reading these reviews.
 I have to stand like 3 ft from this thing to feel anything. It’s can’t do anything for my tiny bed room let alone my living room.
 The fan, while nice looking, did not have the lowest speed functioning. Number 2 &amp; 3 were fine but number 1 was the same as number 2, which was too loud for right next to my bed, which is what I purchased the fan for. My best friend also purchased one of these and it would not turn off without unplugging it. That's 2 for 2. We won't be trying this fan again.
 I have this in our TV room.  It directs air well, I can have it angled on me from 6 feet away and it doesn't affect my wife on the other side of the couch.  I own a 16" pedestal Lasko too, and that one is more noisy for the air it moves.  My work has a couple pedestal from other brands that compete with this one, but I liked the style and airflow with the Lasko better.  To me, the sound difference for the towers seems negligible.  This fan has a small footprint, a remote, and the tower pushes air better than the medium size pedestals.  I love it.
 The ONLY thing I have to complain about this fan is how bright the lights are while turned on (the light over the fan speed and the light for the "ion" function) because I use it in my bedroom at night. Other than that, it is exactly what I hoped it to be. An oscillating tower fan with ions and a remote. :) It's also more quiet than most fans I've had in my bedroom.
 We have not even had this fan one month AND IT MAKES A N=BANGING NOISE -- every time you turn it on. We thought we could "get by" and only use the lowest setting, but sure enough a couple minutes into it - that makes noises too?!? Anyone else have this issue? Any solutions?? Of course I can't return it outside the 30-days (and we are at day 39!?!)
 Love it could blow a little more
 There's a lot to like about this fan if only it were made better. It feels cheap for the price. The remote on mine just died a couple of months after I bought it. I, at first, assumed that the cheap batteries that came with it had just run out of juice, but replacing them with brand new batteries did no good. The remote was a significant part of why I chose this unit, so that was pretty disappointing.
 This is a cute little fan which has done pretty much everything we've asked of it.  The combination of features for the price is very good.<br/><br/>The total airflow output is only modest to moderate, so if you want something to push a lot of air fast, look elsewhere.<br/><br/>One of the best features is that the fan is extremely quiet.  Besides ceiling fans, this fan is pretty much the quietest one I've ever heard.<br/><br/>Like any fan of this style, the height can't be changed, and the blow angle isn't very adjustable.  Keep that in mind for where you're putting it.  If it's for sleeping in a bedroom, over half the air coming out is just going to be hitting the side of your bed unless you do something weird like stand this up 2 feet off the ground.  So consider a different type of fan depending on what your needs are.<br/><br/>Haven't even tried the remote, so I can't comment on that.  I'm not convinced the deionizer actually does anything, but my girlfriend likes it. :)  She also likes that it has the built-in timer.<br/><br/>I read the review of someone else here who said this fan was very energy-efficient and was pulling very few watts, which made me happy.<br/><br/>There is basically nothing to assemble except putting the base of the fan on and running the cord through the hole in the base.  Piece of cake.<br/><br/>Finally, the appearance of this fan is pretty good.  It fits in nicely in most living rooms and seems less ugly and out-of-place than the big gray obelisk that was our other floor fan.
 I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of air this thing pushes, but keep in mind that the column of air seems to only be about a foot wide.This is not really a problem for one person, but say two people may not feel the air, even with the oscillating turned on because the oscillating width is less than 90 degrees. I like to sleep with the fan blowing on me and this worked fine for that. This fan is noticably quieter than my pedestal fan was. I'm not sure if it could be attributed to the fan, but I slept much better last night with it. The air also seems a bit cooler with the ionizer on. I have to agree about the less than stellar range of the remote, but my room is only around 10' so it is okay in here.<br/><br/>Now for the fatal flaw: NO FILTER! There is no way to easily clean this thing without disassembly, which is hindered by security screws! They are H-TYPE screws, which luckily I have on hand. There is a YouTube video of a fella that couldn't figure out how to remove security screws, so he was forced to work from the outside, and that with a combination of a vacuum cleaner and air compressor. So hindsight being 20/20 I would pass on this unit, I am just too lazy to repack it and ship it back.
 I have fans everywhere because I suffer from hourly hot flashes and need to be able to cool myself at any given moment.  This is my favorite fan of all now.  It takes up very little space, it looks nice with the neutral gray color and the woodgrain or burl touch in front.  It's relatively very quiet, and it pumps out a lot of air.  Best of all I love the remote!  As I sit here at the PC, if I feel the heat coming on, I just press one button and the fan, which is about 10 feet away and pre-pointed in my direction, keeps me from having to get up or otherwise interrupt what I'm doing.  I can lie down for a nap on the sofa with this fan pointed at me and if I wake up in the middle of a personal heat wave, I just push the button and a nice big wave of air comes at me.  Ahhhh!!!<br/><br/>Obviously this fan is useful to the rest of the world and not just us sweaty babes.  It has 3 speeds and the oscillation feature, which is all controllable via remote.  It's just wonderful!  Pricier than my previous fans but well worth it.<br/><br/>Also, it has a timer feature which I haven't used but may come in handy for some.  Timer is controllable via remote.<br/><br/>I have no opinion on the ionizer--I don't know whether it makes a difference or not.  For me it's not a noticeable difference so I would not factor that into a buying decision.  Just thought I'd mention that it has ionization in case anyone is looking for that.  Ionizer can turned on/off via remote but only operates with the fan on.<br/><br/>Everything is controllable both by remote and on the fan itself so if you lose the remote it's not the end of the world.  There is a little remote storage cubby on the back of the fan that may help prevent loss.<br/><br/>Try it, you'll like it!
 Moves wind well but is louder than the Honeywell fan <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Honeywell-HYF290B-Quietset-8-Speed-Whole-Room-Tower-Fan/dp/B01N0LQJN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Honeywell HYF290B Quietset 8-Speed Whole-Room Tower Fan</a> that I also have.  I wish it had a setting to run slightly slower and quieter.  If a bit of noise (it's not noisy, just not silent) is okay for you - this fan is great.  For me, it loses the 5-star rating for noise.
 I'm not one to jump on writing a review, but I had to this time.  These fans are FABULOUS!  Came packaged well, they are tall and slim. Easy to get the base assembled. Good wind, quite, and a nice faux wood grain on the front.  The remote control is small and just perfect!  The remote did not come with batteries, takes (2) AAAs, so if you don't have batteries the fan can still be plugged in an working until you get batteries.  I'm thinking about getting one more for my kitchen.  I live in San Diego, CA, but I don't like to run my AC during the summer because it's way too expensive, so these fans will keep me cool all summer long! I'm sitting in my recliner writing this review with the fan on and blowing my direction!!!
 This fan came in really handy for the hight of the LA summer. Obviously it is just a fan not a cooling unit so you still might need to use your aircon etc but it did help make a big difference in our apartment.<br/>There are 3 settings, which is useful. We tend to either have it on 3 or on 1 depending on the dog, his ears get blown about on 3 and he's not too keen on that. I like that it comes with an ION option and although the brightness of the blue LED never affected me, my husband complained that it was too bright for him to sleep with, a little tape or placing something on top of the fan to cover the LED will resolve that though.<br/>The remote might be handy but since it didn't come with batteries we just shoved it in the back of the fan and forgot about it to be honest.<br/><br/>The only reason I haven't given it five stars is because, and maybe this is more of an LA issue, it's a dust collector. Looking at the back of the fan I always see large amounts of dust have clumped together and it make me wonder how much of that is getting through and blowing on us. We keep a clean house but the fan always seems have a large amount of dust on it with a day or two.
 Just got this, put it together and turned it on.  Immediately started to rattle. Even on low the rattle is very noticeable and gets much worse on medium and high.  Sounds like when kids used to put playing cards in the spokes on their bike to make it sound like a motorcycle.  This will have to be returned.  I expected much better for the price.
 Although I have air conditioning, I resist using it when a fan will keep me comfortable and not cost as much to run. Actually, I have no way of knowing how much I save in energy costs by using fans instead of running the a/c. But I'm sure fans draw less energy than a/c compressors.<br/><br/>These fans are reasonably attractive and don't require much room. They are quiet. The remote makes them convenient to turn on or off and to adjust such things as the oscillation or fan speed.<br/><br/>I have no interest in the ionizer feature and have never used it.
 This fan is not going to blow your socks off. The air even at the highest setting is a gentle breeze. But it seems adequate. The airflow is not bad, it's not weak. And it's very quiet.<br/><br/>With the winter coming on and the days getting colder, I put the Wind Curve on the lowest setting.<br/><br/>I love its appearance and faux wood trim. Its timer is intuitive and definitely useful. Its remote control is also very useful.<br/><br/>The Wind Curve beeps when you turn it in on or off and it has various led lights that light up for its various functions. The only thing I don't like about it is that the light for the Ion when it's on is blue and tends to be rather bright. But that's a small gripe.<br/><br/>Another thing -- I'm not sure what the Ion function does. I've had air cleaners before. When you use those, usually the air begins to smell like it's being electricized. With this, one senses no effect.<br/><br/>At the price, I'm glad I bought this fan. I hope it lasts and doesn't grow noisy, as other reviews complain.<br/><br/>It looks great, albeit the plastic materials that make it up are not the best. And it's modern, a step up from the older type fans.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.
 The box it came in was greatly deteriorated. Tape held it together so that it wouldn't just come open. Inside, everything looks like it was repackaged and taped together. Even the foam is torn in certain places.<br/><br/>The fan itself looks ok, however. But it really makes me wonder if this is a new item. I think I could have saved some money by getting a second hand item instead of this one, which may very well also be.
 I wanted a fan to help circulate air during those spring months when the windows are open and to help spread the cool air from my window unit ac throughout the apartment without taking up tons of space. I love that this Lasko is quiet even on its highest setting (sure, it makes a sound, but nothing like comparable units I've tried) and that it barely takes up any floor space. I haven't used the ionizer feature much, but it seemed fine with I tried it out. My only complaints: 1) The fins do not angle very far upward, which would be helpful since the fan isn't that tall. 2) Even on the highest setting, this fan is not super powerful. It works well for my average sized living room, but wouldn't cut it in a large room.
 Wow! I love this fan! I use it in my bedroom and on the low speed it does the whole room just fine. I put the remote on my nightstand and if I wake up hot or sweaty in the middle of the night I just turn it on from my bed, activate the ionizer, the timer for about an hour, oscillating feature and go back to sleep. I like that it has indicator lights on it so that I can see in the dark what features I've set. Some people don't like the lights as they seem to bother them while they are trying to sleep. Doesn't seem to bother me.
 Great fan overall. We use it in my sons room to block out other noises. I'm happy it does not make a beeping noises when the buttons are pressed. My only complaint is that it has been giving off a plastic smell when we turn it on. We have only used it about 3 times so far so hopefully the<br/>Smell goes away.
 I just got this in the mail today and I'm so excited! I am a college student in Florida and my dorm's AC unit is from the 70's which means it breaks down all the time.  These break downs effectively turn my room into an oven and it really doesn't help that my dog sleep with my every night because he's a little heat factory.  My best friend has a different model of this fan, but I knew when my AC started cutting out I needed one ASAP.  Now, my room is cool and thankfully it doesn't take up a lot of room so I was able to squeeze it in my already cramped dorm room! If you are thinking about getting one, stop thinking and start checking out!
 The packaging looked terrible when it came and was nervous it was used or refurbished. Looks like it was just rough shipping with UPS. The fan is pretty tall but perfect for a bedroom. I’ll probbaly just keep it at the lowest setting, but the highest speed didn’t really bring a lot of air out. It has good white noise and the air blows cold. I’ll update if anything else happens.
 As the title says, this fan was super easy to set up. You only NEED a screw driver to put two halves of the base together, but the base attached to the fan with thumb screws. The fan is quiet but still powerful enough to to fit my needs. It's tall enough that I don't need to sit it on top of anything to get air flow on my entire body while sitting. As far as the ionizer goes, I honestly have no idea if it works but I always turn that setting on. The only negative I can give this fan is the lack of included batteries for the remote, but at least it takes AAA and not some obscure coin cell battery, so I didn't have any issues finding the batteries I needed.
 Overall a good fan.  I own 3 of them. Deducing one star because on all three the base wouldn't assemble tightly per the instructions.  the two smaller screws seem too small and the concept is a screw that self threads into plastic which seems like a poor design. That being said, it's stable and doesn't fall over. I would be more worried if I used the oscillation feature but I do not.<br/><br/>Functionally moves air well and I like the ionizer which give off that sense of being at the beach or the air after a lightening storm.  I also like the timer function. Sometimes I turn on when going to bed for the white noise and set to turn off at 2 or 4 hours.
 This fan is perfect for my needs. It is quiet and since it's a tower fan doesn't take up much space either. I use it in a bedroom which is a medium sized 14x18 ft space, so this fan is perfect. Circulates the air well even at the low setting. It would be fine for a larger space I am sure. It's also a pretty nice looking fan too, well worth the price.
 Before investing in this fan, my boyfriend and I had another tower fan that a friend no longer needed that we so graciously took off her hands. And before that, we were using a box fan propped on his desk.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the box fan had to go once we got our tower fan. And that thing was fantastic. Until its untimely demise. Which we were very much unprepared for.<br/><br/>After much research and deliberation (and after Amazon got these back in stock), we picked this "little" guy.<br/><br/>This fan is beautiful and quiet and, unlike our last tower fan, comes with a remote (which we shamefully use more than I actually thought we would).<br/><br/>We've never used the ionizing feature, but the three speeds are perfect (and this fan is still VERY quiet even on the highest one).<br/><br/>Definitely a solid purchase.
 This unit is amazing!  It is incredibly quite, which is a huge bonus.  I don't have to turn the volume up on my TV like you do with most fans.  I was skeptical about it blowing cold air as stated in other reviews.  It actually does blow cold air, which has been so nice with our unusually warm weather lately.  It's nice not just blowing the warm air around the room.  My only complaint is that it can easily be knocked over, but I don't think that's enough to knock a star off.  I have a toddler, but she hasn't had any interest in trying to tip it over.
 As someone who has slept with a box fan next to the bed for the last 10 years this fan is a major upgrade. While it still put out noise it is much quieter because I am comfortable with this fan on low while my box fan had to be on high. My only complaint is that the base that you attach seems really flimsy and if pushed on I feel it would snap off or crack easily.
 I've owned Lasko fans in the past - noise level and efficacy of fan is great. My last one lasted four years before having any problems. Recently bought this one to replace the previous one. I had problems with the remote on the last one - took about 2 years for the springs in battery compartment to lose their strength. It still worked with some tinkering. This one - remote control does not work fresh out of the box. Other than that, no issues with the fan.
 Great fan, just ordered my second one. Works well as a family or bed room fan - with a decently wide arc to its motion of travel. It's also very quiet, but loud enough to provide some "white noise", if that's your thing. The air flow is excellent and has three speed settings which all seem to achieve exactly what makes sense for Slow, Medium, and Fast settings. The blue LED light on the top of the unit is no where near as bright as people make it out to be. "Illuminates my room like a freight train at night"? Get real. Whoever thinks this little LED is bright has never owned a cable modem with flickering LEDs. My work computer's charging indicator is brighter than this fan's LED.
 It works OK, but in my opinion it is not as good as the slightly more expensive model 2559 that is available from one one of the "big box" home improvement stores that is orange in color. This one has a sort of "rattle vibration" sound to it once in awhile. It's not that bad, but it is noticeable over the 2559. Maybe we just got one that is slightly out of balance. It seems to move as much air as, or close to the 2559. Overall it's a decent fan.
 This is my 3rd floor fans from Lasko. So far, they are all working well. I didn't know this fan has louvers on the front grill that allows for vertical (up or down) manual adjustment of air flow as desired. This is a big plus. I'm surprise this is not mentioned in the online description at all. Price is good and the delivery is fast (if Prime).
 I didn't like that the tower blade would run the top plastic housing incrementally. Also the fan was hard to clean perfectly. But was cleaned frequently. Fan went out on the 369th day.just out of warranty. Call and sent email. Was told sorry. However I've had a couple of lasko fans break down. I have bought many for private and company use. Never again, found better. See ya later"Lasko" you had your shot. Dan is Done haha
 I am a very, very hot sleeper. I radiate heat I wake myself up sweating. I sleep with the A/C very low and use an overhead fan. I STILL SWEAT. I've changed my PJ's, sheets, etc. I did a few days research on Amazon for a fan that I could use to basically put right near my face. Definitely wanted one that would be quiet and somewhat powerful but not dry my eyes out. This is the fan! It honestly was a lot taller than I was expecting but it's amazing. It emits a small amount of noise, but what fan doesn't honestly. It didn't bother me and honestly helped with white noise trying to go to sleep. I slept with it and didn't wake up sweating once nor did I get too cold. It is perfect.

Quieter than any box fan, and the remote is a blessing.  In the living room, it can be adjusted without getting up, and late at night in the bedroom, it allows me to turn it on or off without getting out of bed.  The PERFECT lazy man's fan!  I better order another one, so I can be even lazier and not have to move it.  It works so well that we haven't used the central air this year.  It is almost May and we are already having hot, muggy, days with temps up into the mid to high eighties.
 We returned this the very next day.  There was a really loud and annoying noise that happened when you ran it.  We tried all different settings but it wasn't worth it to keep.  IT was a large tower fan which was nice and looked nice.  We did like the fan remote too.  Very easy to return.
 It is rare that I am disappointed with an amazon purchase. Today is one of those days.<br/>I have two units with the wood grain finish; for over a year they have been used regularly with no issues.  This one went on sale, 70 days later this platinum model no longer functions well a bear is going out on the motor or turbine and is sounds horrible. Out of luck with amazon as it is out of the return period. Let's see how lasko handles my issue when I contact them tomorrow. For now its a two star for this unit. I will update accordingly as the process unfolds.
 I originally purchased model T42902, it provided a steady stream of air on all 3 settings. I only returned it because it honestly looked cheaper than expected and because it SOUNDED as if it was struggling to keep a steady pace at low and med.<br/><br/>I purchased this one because I remember last summer I complimented my sisters Lasco fan model number 2554. This one looks nicer in my apartment! The timer on this model can be set in from 30 mins to 7 hours 30mins. Remote works well. BTW I also found an app that works on my Samsung Note tablet that can replace the remote! Sometimes I'll leave this thing running for hours because I forget it on from how quiet it is. I live it!!!
 This is amazing. We love it. I was recently diagnosed with an extreme allergy to dust (as well as a few other things), and this was the second product I bought as a result. We keep it in our bedroom so that we can turn the AC off (or lower it) at night, and just use this to stay cool. It does a great job cooling down a small but not tiny room. It's hard to say for sure how much the purifier does, but it definitely helps keep the room from getting too stuffy, and it seems like my allergies have been at least slightly more under control at night.
 I only had this fan for a few days, so far it's great. My apartment is so hot during these sunny days. Even on the low setting it's a cool breeze and the air that blows feel and smells so fresh. When it oscillate it's a short way round. The best thing is to put it somewhere in the corner from a distance and turn it up high. This fan cools my whole living room space. I would recommend this to anyone on a budget that can afford a air conditioner right now. This takes the place of an air conditioner I believe and it's not freezing cold but just right.
 I bought the silver woodgrain color.<br/>Wind is strong. Easy to control. Looks great and blends with other furniture well if you have a lot of wooden one.<br/><br/>I liked it very much and bought a second one for another room. I recommend spending a bit more so you have this good looking piece instead of bulky, can-be-dangerous traditional fan.
 Very happy with this fan. It’s quieter than I expected, and blows hard. No pun. The reason for 4 stars is because Amazon didn’t put it in a shipping box. So the box it comes in was damaged. I told Amazon it might be a good idea for this particular item to be inside a shipping box.
 WE needed a fan since we don't like the air from the ceiling fan as it covers the face directly. This fan was the one we are looking for. It has 3 speeds, it oscillates and has a timer too and comes with a remote. We've had it for 2 summers now, the only con is that i wish the lowest setting had the fan speed lower. The fan speed is quite high even at lowest setting.
 I read several reviews before purchasing this fan and don't understand how some people said it was noisy and that the little blue light was really bright. The fan is quiet and the blue light does not light up the whole room like others said. I love that you can program it to stay on for a specific time. I program it for an hour or two when I go to bed. I never hear when it shuts off. I also love the remote. You can program it from your bed and not have to worry about falling asleep and leaving it on all night. I keep the remote on my night stand. I would recommend this fan to anyone.
 As a person living in Arizona I can tell you this fan is fantastic. It's very quiet, it cools just like you would wish. The fan is also much larger than it seems but that's not a bad thing at all.
 Not as good as a ceiling fan but very good nonetheless. We have nice chandelier fixtures in bedrooms and didn't want to take them down to put up ceiling fans up so we went this route. They work very well and the ability to oscillate is a big bonus. We live in Florida and sleep with these on every night. They don't take up much room and can be tucked away if needed. Not to big and don't really look like an eye sore. Have not used the remotes on any of them so cannot comment on these.
 Product was broken upon arrival. I was in the Hospital and was unable to open the box until after 30 days. I made both Lasko and Amazon aware of that fact but neither would help me by either replacing the fan or giving my money back.  I am  an 80 year old on Social  Security and spending $60.00 for a fan is a lot of money and I think they should have tried to help me in some way!
 Fan arrived in a box that had obviously been previously opened with what I swear looked like two address labels pasted over the top of each other so I guessed it was a refurb. Its hot here and I was just going to bite the bullet and use it. Regrettably it sounds like a minigun spinning up. There is a very distinct and very loud whir coming from the motor and within minutes it started smelling like melted electronics.<br/><br/>Its an attractive device, and it seems to kick out plenty of air contrary to other reviews I have seen. However its noisy, smelly, and I honestly do not think its safe to leave running unsupervised. Going through the return process now.
 Had a similiar one for over 7 years before the fan went out. Quits moves plenty of air. Love the ION part of it but I always wonder if they ION thing works? How do you know. Oh BTW the ION light is super bright blue light that I have to turn off at night. that is the only flaw.
 Fan worked great for about six months and then started making noise when rotating. It eventually stopped rotating completely. I took mine apart to see what had broken and discovered that the revolving gear assembly  that has all the weight of the fan sitting on it is made of the cheapest plastic and parts and was so flimsy that it’s a wonder that it works at all. Unless you’re willing to take this fan apart down to the assembly line level, it is impossible to clean it. To clean it properly, you actually have to take the circuit boards and motor out because of the design. Save your money and go with a different brand.
 I was surprised,  its large and tall and is the best fan. Its hot in Nashville now and its on right now.it has a slight hum, but not a bother. It cools our large bedroom. Love it
 We've purchased several of these fans now because we like them so much!  Perfect if you have small children around as they cant get their little fingers anywhere dangerous.  We really like the timer setting, which is great for nighttime.  It's a fairly quiet fan, even on the highest speed.
 A GIFT  FOR MY GRANDAUGHTER I HAD BOUGHT ONE FOR MYSELF BECAUSE MY BEDROOM HAS 2 BIG WINDOWS AND IT GETS VERY HOT IN MIAMI, SHE HAD SEEN MINE AND TOLD ME SHE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM SO I BOUGHT ONE FOR HER SHE LOVES IT NO MORE HOTNESS SPECIALLY AT NIGHT IT DOES WHATS SUPPOSED TO DO WE LOVE IT.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-RWBWWZW7XYKHE"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1Ef67xVtXS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91I5FtGlNkS.png"/> The fan only has three settings and in comparison to most fans, the highest setting (3) is more like a low setting on other fans. The motor made a rattling noise when I first set it up. The light for the Ionizer is super bright! Definitely disturbs sleep if you need it to be dark. I wouldn’t exactly recommend this.
 The power behind this fan is laughable. The setting on 3 (high) feels like what 1 (low) should be. Anything other than the highest setting was pointless and the highest setting doesn't do much to cool you off, just kinda moves the air around a little. Definitely would not recommend. Aside from that, the timer works great and the remote works.
 We bought one of these fans 7 years ago; we use it regularly, and it is still going strong!  Love the remote, the timer, and the 3 speeds. It can also ionize the air. The base is very stable and the generous 42 inch height lets it move a LOT of air. This tower can is also attractive,  and an asset to the decor. I'll be buying another one for our gazebo!
 Very powerful sleek fan. I m surprised is this fan or AC as it gives so cool air even in 85 degree too that sometime I move its direction away from me. I m very happy with this purchase it's been 2 weeks I m using this. Just one drawback that coz of its sleek body it dsnt cover much area on its left and right so have to set rotation mode Ven more than one person is using this while sleeping.
 The Tower Fan meets my expectations. I read several reviews that stated it did not have enough thrust. I use it in a 12 X14 room and I'm fine.Sure there are some out there may be stronger, this one is use in my office, I don't want papers blowing off my desk. It is not an Air Conditioner ... have great features: a timer, it oscillates and has three speeds. Appears to be well put together, blends well with house decor.
 I bought two of these fans  one for home, and after receiving and demoing one for my office, love them they move the air around and cool at the same time I have used both non stop May,June,July and August 2016, love that I can set a desired time and wind speed and just walk away without ever having to worry if I turned it off. Very slim line and stylish without taking up the usual traditional round fan space, very durable and easy to move around a room to desired position and area you are trying to cool, low noise even on the highest setting.
 I'm using this fan to move air from the cooler north end of the house to the warm south end, primarily while the AC is running.  It does a good job and is quieter than the box fan we have used in the past.
 I was extremely excited when i got this fan just because of the sheer size of it! I thought it was gonna be a good, powerfull fan but I was very dissatisfied. Its not powerfull at all. On its highest setting its like a breeze. My last sentence may be a little dramatic but its just not a strong flow of wind/air. Very disappointed.
 Box arrived with taped ends no cover box. No screws included that were needed to complete base, then attach to fan. Lasko telephone lines are waaaay too busy. You will be on hold forever, have them call you back. They nicely sent me screws, but they were just enough to large in diameter not to screw down to the head so they were virtually worthless. I solved the problem by using metal spacers from our shop stash. Problem solved.<br/>Other than that, fan is wonderful and I would highly recommend it. Easy to operate, easy to move from room to room if necessary. 3 speed levels and oscillating if you want.
 In Florida. My house is perfectly comfortable with these fans even though my thermostat shows 80 degrees.
 I bought another Lasko fan and loved it but gave it to a friend when I moved. I missed it. I purchase the new 2551 and have been very pleased. It's very quiet and puts out great air. It keeps me from turning my AC down and with the hot Louisiana summer, this saves money. I'd give it 5 stars but I don't like the blue light for the ionizer. When sleeping, you should be in complete darkness. Your body cannot properly produce melatonin with any lights on especially any light from blue light spectrum. Your body reads it as daytime. If anything, the light should be red. I have a piece of black electrical tape over the ionizer light. It helps but a better design would be to make the light less bright and make it red so it does not disrupt circadian rhythm. The remote is a big plus.
 I'm giving it a 5 star because it does put out cool air.  I am cooling a combination kitchen and dining room and it is doing the job. It is even bigger than I imagined but keeping it.  I have a Lasko heater, with a remote, that I love.  I'm a little disappointed that this remote is not as nice as the heater one.  I hate that the fan, nor the remote, hold the settings when it is turned off.  Nothing is more aggravating to get it all set just to have to set it everytime. It is a little noisier than the heater but not unbearable. I don't use the ionizer frequently so can't respond to that. I had no trouble with assembly of the base.  Service and delivery were great. I plan to get another Lasko fan for another room but it doesn't have to be this big.
 ION. 3 fan setting with a timer controller. I love this fan, because it saved me from hot weather this year. SD got up to 100s and my computer made my room 20 degrees hotter than it is, so this fan def did its job controlling the heat in my room. Def a good buy for $70. It's a budget tower for people who is looking for a cheap but solid tower.
 Fan does cool 5-7 ft in front of me, but is noisier compared with a standard table fan, even when running at the lowest mode.  I had hoped this would be completely silent.  I won't get this model again.
 I live in Texas and it has been over 100 for the last 30 days and I have bought several fans. I love this one the best. It is quite and the air is cool. I love it and will buy more to replace the others.
 Quiet but just enough noise to cancel out apartment living noise and disruption’s throughout the night so it does it’s job in enough noise like a said so I can sleep soundly
 Mine came in bad shape. Scratches all over it. Box was damaged. Fan moves good amount of are. For the price it should have more of a swing. (Osalating) Just that would keep me from buying again. Works ok for a small area. Maybe four foot area. So if you need it to osalate for bigger area. Than don't waste the money.
 Don't understand the complaints about poor wind force. This thing is practically blowing me out of the room. My brother has one (which is why I purchased one for myself) and his fan is just as powerful. Perhaps others got one that is deficient and needs to be returned, because I love this fan and am completely satisfied. In fact, I usually keep mine on low, because I get too cold otherwise! Also am planning to use it to blow heat from the gas logs through the house this winter.
 This fan is perfect. I have a very tall bed, and getting a fan that is stable on it's base so I don't knock it over if I get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom has been a trial. It's just loud enough to provide a very little white noise, but not so loud that I really hear it. It has three speeds and a remote, which is awesome if I get too hot at night. I highly rec this product.
 Great fan.  Space saver.  My first tower fan but if it ever goes I will get another.<br/><br/>Plenty of air, and not overly loud.  These are a bit louder than a good quality desktop round fan however.  But for me the sound of a fan is something that you can sleep with.<br/><br/>The button on the top that controls the oscillation seems to be getting a little wacked after only a few months, meaning you have to press it really hard to get it work.<br/><br/>If that ever goes completely I will be disappointed.
 We got this fan mostly to help the dogs stay cool in the summer while we were all at work.  It worked real well and we'd come home to the dogs stretched out in front of it -sort of jockey for position.  Since it turns they were each able to get their own brush of cooler air.  It also doesn't take up much space.  We have a really small apartment, so it's great that it can stand in a corner when not in use and take up little space.
 I don't have any AC so I was desperate to find a fan that would help keep my room cool during the day and while I sleep, and this thing does the trick! It's easy to assemble and it's relatively quiet. I love this fan so much.
 I was hoping to receive a fan that was silent when being used while sleeping at night. I read a ton of reviews of this and similar fans. It was far from silent and I would agree from others that it’s similar to white noise. The only plus is the remote that I have on a bedside table. I can turn it on if it gets warm in the room and quickly fall back asleep.
 You really can tell when the ionizer is on, can make the livingroom of my apt downright chilly, in the summer!  (for reference, apt is about 550 sq ft and living area it's in is about 15x10)
 It does the job and I love the way it looks.<br/>It blows cool air (not as cold as an AC, but it is a fan after all) that really cools me down on the 2nd floor of a California townhouse in this dreadful heat.<br/><br/>The remote really encourages my laziness but I like it.  It takes two AAA batteries.<br/>It oscillates and the range is very far and very strong.<br/><br/>I would buy another if I needed to.
 After reading about several tower fans, and reading through hundreds of reviews, we settled on this one. Our bedroom gets insanely hot, and we needed the fan to cool it down and move the hot air out. This fan worked well for two days. The third day, I turned it on and left the room. When I returned a little later there was a terrible toxic smell of melting plastic or something electrical burning. Something inside the fan was not happy. As much as I'd like my room to be cool, I'd much rather not breath in noxious fumes or start a fire. This fan is going back immediately. Time to find another fan... (And if anyone is interested, subsequent reading has informed me that air cleaning using an ionizer like this could actually be toxic to breathe. Ick!)
 We had purchased an older fan of the same model from Sam's Club and that motor burnt out when my son stuck some toys in there.  We got the same tower model again because it fit in his tight room.  The new model is even quieter than the old and works great.  No complaints at all.
 The powerful breeze this produces in our bedroom feels like we're sleeping by the sea shore.  It's quiet and powerful with 3 speeds to choose from.  The timer is great as we tend to get cooler as the night progresses and don't have to wake up to turn it off.  The remote has great range and eliminates us from arguing as to who has to get out of bed to turn the fan on when we forget to do it before we get into bed.  We've had it for a week and we love it!
 I bought this a few months ago. I had no idea how much I would use it. I live in the desert and the temperature has been in the three digests for a couple of months. I never turn it off except when I take it from the living room to the bedroom. The circulation and cool breeze is a life saver. It is light weight and easy to vacuum the dust out of the slates. I think I'm going to buy another one so I don't have to move this one. The price was better then my local store. Thanks so much!
 This is not even a little “quiet”. It makes this obnoxious squeak/rattle sound like something inside is loose. It’s a big and bulky fan that doesn’t blow very strong even on the highest speed. Definitely not worth the price. Sending it back because I wanted to throw it out the window within 30 seconds of turning it on.
 I hated this fan so much I sent it back. I love Lasko fans so I was so surprised with how bad it worked. There was no kind of air coming out. I don't understand the positive reviews. Maybe mines was defective. I did buy a totally different Lasko fan after I sent this one back.
 Love it second time I bought this brand 1st was a box fan with h remote but it was loud. Went to a party and saw this one said I would give it  a try love the remote and the noise level is nice don’t have to turn up the TV when I turn it on.
 Pushes air well, the oscillation is very limited but not really a big deal. It's not louder than any other large fan really, but the noise it makes is a humming noise instead of a fan-like noise.<br/><br/>The plastic it's made out of is really, really soft and cheap though. There are areas where the edges of two different pieces are cutting into each other. Also, oscillate button on the body doesn't work, only the remote.
 This fan is wonderful, quiet, efficient, moves a lot of air and for some reason it seems to almost cool the air too. My only complaint, and it is minor, is that a blue light comes on when using the ionizer feature and it is way too bright if you have that feature on when you are trying to sleep.
 Love this fan! It's surprisingly quiet, even at high. The oscillation moves the air around the room well. It's taller than I thought it would be, but it's slim enough that it doesn't take up much space in the room. My only minor criticism is that the assembly instructions aren't very good. Maybe they need to use photography instead of drawings.
 Hi, I have a toddler in my home and I am not looking for a fan with blades because its very dangerous for the kids also they may not breath so comfortably, so I decided to go with a tower fan even though it can't produce more air compared to the fan with Blades. Then I brought this fan from COUPONONMORE&amp;MORE which is safe for the kid and have enough air and cools the room so quickly and Ionizer is the major plus to this fan... This fan looks stylish and it comes assembled and no pain in assemble - which is the great point I like it. Operating the fan is so easy and its very very quite too.
 Larger than I expected and very stable. But works wonderfully. We had some very hot days in the summer, if I turned the fan on and used the timer, closed the house up in the morning, opened it up at night, I didn't have to use the air at all.
 This fan is ANNOYING!! Clicks when it oscillates, not to mention the humming of the motor is awful. For a “silent fan” this thing is freaking loud. I’ve been trying to get it to quiet down for two days. It’s going back, I love lasko fans but this one sucks!<br/><br/>Update a month later decided to give it a chance and if let me down it now click and the motor hums so loudly I can sleep with It on!<br/><br/>DO NOT BUY THIS FAN
 This lasso 2554 is simply amazing ... I ordered this for my two small dogs , to move some air around for them on hot days . Shipping was fast and assembly was fast and easy ! I did it myself without the help of my husband . It puts a lot of air out , I was tolally surprised by it !! I had to get a throw blanket because I got cold !! So glad I bought this item !! :)<br/>Happy Customer! Thank you
 Works well. The motor does not sound perfect, and does have a slight mechanical sound to it. Despite that, I am still able to sleep pretty soundly with it. The oscillation makes no additional noise and does not alter the acoustics of the fan motor itself. The sound output is consistent which is much appreciated for a sleep time white noise generating fan.<br/><br/>It's spread and area of effectiveness is impressive. It moves a good amount of air, and is pretty consistent at doing so.<br/><br/>The remote is terrible. I simply threw it away. Being 6-7 feet away from the fan, pointing the remote directly at it, the button actually fires the respective command maybe 1 out of 5 tries.<br/><br/>The fan does not remember the last mode it was in when turning it on. It would be nice if the fan turned on and remembered the state of the oscillator and fan speed.<br/><br/>The ionizer is just a marketing ploy. This applies to anything that "ionizes" your air. This is a useless technology that has absolutely no benefit to you, and could even cause you minor health issues. Ionizers work by spewing out negatively charged ions, which attract particulates in the air. They attach to those particulates, which then become negatively charged and stick to the walls, bedding, carpet/flooring, and the fan itself. This is a loose bond however, so moving around in your room is simply going to throw those particulates right back into the air. Furthermore, ionization results in the generation of ozone (O3), which in higher quantities can cause headaches and other minor health issues.<br/><br/>We added a velcro PollenTech filter to the back, which is a fantastic idea you should consider if purchasing this fan.
 I live in an apartment on the 3rd floor with no A/C.... if you do the math, that means it can get pretty hot!<br/>So I looked for something that could help me sleep in peace while wearing pajamas and chilling in the house.. and I found this guy.<br/>I love it.<br/>It's pretty tall, powerful, and comes with a remote! Most the time, oscillation is "meh" with fans, but works great on this thing.<br/>The noise level seems fine to me (as I like a little white noise when going to sleep), but it may not be so great for the super light sleeper.
 Package was mauled when it arrived. It was in the Lasko fan box which is very thin. Fan has a rattling noise while on setting 1 unless the ionizer is on. The swivel know to position the "blades" is junk. On the front panel just below the LED lights, it looks like the plastic has been burned. Overall, very unimpressed with this product. Trying to decide if I will send it back or not. Sometimes that's more of a hassle. I had a Lasko fan before this one that was just fine but we were moving and I didn't feel like dragging it across the country. I bought this one to replace it. The last fan was going strong on almost 8 years....This one feels considerably cheaper.
 OK fan for the price.  Worked well for four months then randomly started making noised  that sounded like a helicopter hovering.  It's very bothersome at night.  The fan isn't what I'd call sturdy but you get what you pay for and this was on the low end.  It's plastic and cheap feeling build lends itself to there kind of issues.  Just get me through the summer!
 My bedroom has a large west-facing window that causes my room to heat up considerably during warmer months. This fan helps circulate the warm air, cooling it down (and my room) in the process by a noticeable few degrees.<br/><br/>While it has no cooling/heating element, it blows noticeably cooler air, even on the lowest of three settings—I can feel a cool breeze from 5+ feet away. With the oscillating feature enabled, the fan rotates on the base about 120°. While this fan is not silent, it makes a reasonable amount of white noise for how much air it moves around, barely noticeable unless the room is devoid of all other sound. The remote comes in handy for turning on/off the fan and adjusting settings from any place in the room. Setup was easy—I spent maybe five minutes securing six screws between the base and the tower.<br/><br/>The bright blue light other reviewers mention signals that the ION feature is enabled. This feature is optional; if the brighter light would be bothersome to you, you can turn it off with no loss to function. The ION feature is nice to have, but this is a fan (a great one!), not an air filter.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a well-designed fan that lives up to the hype and looks nice, too.
 Love it. It's perfect for a small room and even at it's lowest setting moves a nice amount of cool feeling air. It's reasonably quiet. I haven't tried the timer as I have no need of it. The oscillating mode is also done quietly. The only problems I've had with it was getting it out of the box as it was packed so tightly with protective Styrofoam.
 I have two of these. The first was just about everything I'd want in a vertical fan including a bunch of features I don't use and a remote control. I liked it so much that when I needed a second I bought another. It was everything the first one was plus noisy. When the fan is on you can hear the mechanics at work inside the base and I don't like it. Suppose I could have returned it for an exchange but laziness and hope it would fix itself kept me from doing so. It's still making noise so the second one isn't a winner (3 stars) but the first was (5 stars) hence my rating (4 stars).
 This fan is great. Nothing like coming home from working in a 120 degree factory job and let this fan hit your hot dirty sweaty body. Does the job just right. Its quiet so your roommate will still hear you touching yourself.
 First one with silver platinum finish was quite good but I exchange for a wood grain model only for cosmetic reasons .<br/>The second one arrived and has excess motor noise, much more than the first one.<br/>I will exchange it for another wood grain one as this was not present in my first fan. Hope the third one will be better.<br/><br/>Very effective at moving air; very space efficient.
 I bought this fan to replace my old lasko tower fan after 10 years! Assembly was very easy and straightforward - some reviewers said their order did not come with hardware, but my order thankfully did. I think the fan functions very well, but the remote control can be finicky if you aren't pointing at the correct angle. The noise level is not annoyingly loud, but has a nice hum/can add a little white noise while you sleep. There is no added noise when oscillating (oscilating angle is maybe 130 degrees?). I do not find the light to be very bright while sleeping.<br/><br/>Only concern I can foresee coming across is when it comes time to clean the filter - lasko fans require a special screw driver to open the fan to clean and they do not recommend opening the fan.
 this fan is quiet, easy to assemble, and when using the ion button it drastically reduces the temp in the room. I highly recommend. only downside is it being all plastic.
 Love the remote, it cools our entire master bedroom that runs hot normally. Its quiet so it doesn't wake our newborn either. It has a 30 min, 1,2 and 4 hour setting and ion setting as well
 Loved this fan when it worked, but had it less than two months and it died :( slowly too, was sad to watch as I love the Vornado concept (I hate air blowing directly on me so the angling was perfect); I almost tried the next size up in case that was the issue, but was hesitant as that one wasn't Prime. The return process was at least painless.
 Just got this fan today, it's been on since it came. Sleek design looks nice, quiet even on the highest setting; I can't hear it over my tv. Air coming out is actually cold and i'm so happy about it. I'm buying second one to replace the fan in another room.
 I'm very disappointed in how this fan starts to rattle after only a short while. I've had one fan for less than two months and it started to rattle while the oscillation feature is on. It's distracting during the day and is very annoying while trying to sleep. At the time I purchased this fan it was rated by amazon as the "#1 seller." But I can't see how this is possible. I tried to do my research and read a lot of reviews before deciding on a selection but there are thousands of reviews for this fan alone and it's just not possible to read them all.<br/><br/>This fan would be perfect if it could be silent but I'm finding that oscillating fans tend to be noisy and rattly or sound like a helicopter in the distance. Both of my fans are going back. I This really is a letdown and I'm very irritated by this whole process.<br/><br/>My partner, who also purchased two of these fans, is not having a rattling noisy issue with one of his fans also. It was silent for about a month and now it's starting to intermittently rattle. This is exactly what happened how mine began to make noise. And it only got worse with time. I feel bad that I recommended these fans to someone I know who now is having problems with them. It seems that eventually oscillating fans have this issue. It's unfortunate and I think I will stay away from them as I've had no luck with several brands of tower fans.
 We use this fan every day, almost all day and have had it for months. We have taken extra caution in moving it around as other reviews have stated the base breaks but no issues here.  It is definitely quiet, and even on the low setting it puts out a surprising amount of air... Can't have it directly on you if it is too close in my opinion.  No sqeaking issues but when you turn it off I can see where down the road it might start doing that.  Would definitely buy this again, great fan.
 Purchased this back in September 2011 and has been running great since. I really never use the Ionizer setting as many others have indicated it doesn't really do much but the fan itself is awesome for my rental-home which unfortunately has swamp-cooling instead of air-conditioning.<br/><br/>*Update 9-8-15* Our cat, thinking this fan was a scratching post, knocked it over on our tile floor and the fan is STILL working. The oscillation has become kind of twitchy or jerky, it's not as smooth of a rotation as it was before but all settings still work just fine. I think it's time to buy another one of these to keep in the corner of the living room.
 Met and surpassed all of our expectations. This fan provides all the features found in typical stand fans including multiple speeds and perceived increased air volume for increased cooling effect, oscillation sufficient to provide comfort to two persons sitting in side-by-side recliners, easy operation using a small stowable remote control and a slender profile which is less intrusive than a wide blade in a wire cage.  We are most pleased with the fan and the purchase price.
 I love this fan.  It goes with me throughout my apartment from my desk area in the living room to the bedroom to the bathroom.  I need this unit to supplement the window air conditioning units which do not do the best job of cooling the space.  This fan is the added touch that makes living in my apartment in the summertime more bearable.  On cooler days when the air conditioning unit is not necessary,  I still use the fan in the bedroom to produce a wonderful breeze while I sleep. This was a wise purchase.
 Looks nice, typical light weight plastic - I bought two and they both arrived without incident.  All controls work well.  It's not as powerful as I would like or as I expected, but it is relatively quiet.  I suppose you can't have both.  It is good if you have to people and one is cold and the other is hot; when you don't have it on oscillate, it has a pretty direct line of air.  Otherwise, you'll always need it on oscillate as it really doesn't move air around like other circle fans.
 I read many of the reviews on this Lasko 42-inch Wind Curve Fan on Amazon; the reviews by verified purchasers. So, I had a good idea of the pros and cons based on other users experiences before purchasing. I purchased this fan to replace an early model Hitachi tower fan that we used in our bedroom at our ranch house, which is in the Rocky Mountain west. We used the fan year around to circulate air. Our Hitachi fan was probably 20 years old and was making retirement sounds the past year or so. Although it still worked ok it was becoming a little noisy. I was not able to find a new Hitachi-brand tower fan, so I guess they no longer make fans for the USA market? We also have a few Vornado-brand fans and have had good experiences with them. But, I decided to try the Lasko tower fan based on the features it has. It is much taller than my old Hitachi fan, which is a key feature I like. It is also much more quiet at any speed than the Hitachi (even when new). The Lasko fan came well packaged. It was easy to install the base; no problems with instructions or screws provided. The slim-line style of the fan and the dark color tones allow it to blend into our bedroom décor. It is pleasing to the eye, and is generally not noticeable. Our bedroom is about 300 square feet, so is not a large space, and as such we use the Lasko fan on the lowest speed at night when we sleep. The "on" light is quite dim and is a white light. The "ion" light is brighter and is a blue light. I generally run the fan with the "ion" feature active and find that neither light is (nor both together are) bright enough to bother me (or my wife). My wife prefers the fan running with the "ion" feature on. She says she sleeps better with it ionizing. We both like the handy dandy remote control that comes with the fan. We leave it on the night stand next to the bed and can use it to turn the fan on/off and control the other features from our bed. Typically, we forget to turn the fan on until we are in bed - and the old Hitachi fan did not have a remote. Our thanks to the Lasko folks for providing this creature comfort with the Model 2554 42-inch Wind Curve tower fan! We have had the new Lasko fan going steady every night, and often during the day also, for about 2 months with absolutely no issues or problems. Hopefully, it will be reliable for the longer term ahead. For the price, the features, and the style, I am very please with this purchase to date, and so is my wife. This is a cost-effective fan. It was significantly less expensive than our Hitachi fan, so even if it lasts half as long, it will be very cost-effective. We are off to a good start! Stay Tuned!
 Pros: Fan has many great features. The timer is fantastic. The unit sounds more like a window ac unit than an actual fan. Sleek design that looks good in my room. Great if you want the white noise for sleeping.<br/><br/>Cons: When using the ionizer it turns ona. Blue LED that lights up the whole room at night. They probably tested this in some building during the daytime and thought it looked cool. Cool? Yes, but not practical. Stick with something less bright. Also, the highest fan setting doesn't move a large volume of air for the power compared to my regular stand up fan. Not the fan you want in a hot summer garage.
 Loved it. This fan Creates a nice breeze. You have to assemble the legs and that was easy.  It takes up so little space and best of all SMALL CHILDREN CANNOT PUT THEIR FINGERS IN IT. If you have babies or toddlers this is the fan to get.
 Lasted one year. Only used it in August and September last year and July through August this year. Began putting out less and less air and now it's useless. We have a similar Bionaire that's lasted 5 years and still puts out the same amount of air.
 I've only owned it a couple months but I love it. It is very quiet.  I like knowing the ionizer is cleaning the air. Timer is good but I find we leave it on &amp; set it to occilate all day. Just wish all manufacturers would use more metal vs all plastic parts.
 This is a great fan. I needed to replace my old tower fan that finally broke after many years of use. I spent a lot of time researching products and customer reviews online. For some reason fans are oddly expensive and I did not want to overpay for something that did not work very well. All of the reviews were pretty positive for this Lasko #2554 and once I received it, I found out why. It looks beautiful and works great. I live in California and am used to 100+ degree days during the summer. No matter how hot the rest of the house gets, I am comfortable with this fan blowing in my direction. Highly recommend.
 Not nearly as loud as comparable fans from other manufacturers, and it's quite stylish, for a fan. We used this for about 5 months straight, on low in our toddlers room, to keep her from getting too warm. When the ionizer function is on, it emits a soft blue light, which my daughter loves, but some people might not like it. I covered it with a piece of black tape, until my daughter told me quite clearly (for a 2 year old) to take the tape off, she couldn't see the blue).<br/><br/>Good buy, it will definitely be coming out of storage at the first sign of warm weather again
 It has been running constantly for a couple of months.  The piece of plastic that serves as the stand is very flimsy and broke right out of the box, but works okay.  It's not very sturdy, you need two hands to adjust it - one to hold it steady, the other to push the buttons.  It is very quiet, and I've had to turn it down on occasion because it got too cold.  This would have been a 5 star item if it just had a bit more weight to it.
 If you are looking for a lot of air movement, this is not the fan for you. On the highest setting, it’s barely a breeze. On the upside, it is very quiet and sleek looking. Bought for a dorm room and doesn’t pack much punch.
 Eh, it worked for a few years. In that time the stand broke and the remote refused to work.<br/>Right now it just blows air but it won’t rotate.<br/>If you want a glorified fan that can’t stop offelatint - meh, sure. If you want something better then let me know. Cause I’d like something better! Please, let me know! Heh
 Wow! Very easy to assemble. Love that it has a remote. Powerful air, can feel it all the way across the room. Will likely buy a few more to replace my standard box fans that don't even compare to this fan!! Highly recommend!
 This is probably the best fan we've bought yet . Our other Lasko fan, took a tumble down the stairs when 2 Jehovah's witnesses rang our doorbell, startled the dogs, who got up barking and running, and tripped on the cord and sent the fan tumbling down the staircase.  The original fan, although it was in pieces, STILL WORKED after I put it back together with duct tape. (albeit it was a little louder than usual, and it looked like it had been in a wreck).  So we put the old fan in our basement, and the NEW one with the ION air in the bedroom.  IT's perfectly quiet.<br/>The only CON is that bright blue light on the console.  We just put a sock over it, and that solves that.
 It's pretty good, especially for the price.  The remote is a nice touch.  FYI, I use this in my home office.  Issues:  1) The fan speed range should be shifted lower to give me a lower speed option.  I only use the lowest speed, even in the middle of summer, and can't imagine ever using medium and high, but I would use a lower speed at times, if it were available.  2) I intermittently hear a plasticy grinding noise when the fan reverses direction in oscillating mode and therefore I tend to avoid using oscillating for that reason.  3) The timer is a nuisance if I accidentally activate it via the remote -- it takes another 15 button clicks to turn off the timer.  I don't understand why anyone would want a timer on a fan.
 I purchased this fan and received it on July 3. 2015.  It worked very nicely all summer.  I wanted to use it near our wood stove to distribute heat toward another area of the house, but when plugged in, it didn't work...at all.  So three months of use at the most, and now...nothing.  Of course, it is not returnable because you have only 30 days to return it.  So...guess the only recourse is to contact Lasko...and hope something can be done.  When it worked, it was great...but I expect more than 3 months from a product like this!!!
 works well for my apt in chicago, and I like having the remote. if you live in texas or other dreadfully hot climate place, you may want a more powerful one. I haven't figured out the importance of the ionizer though. not sure what the benefit is (are there are studies indicating that the ionizer makes any difference in one's health or quality of life?). I press the ionizer button, and a blue light comes on. is it working? is it helping me? why not just keep it on all the time? what would prompt one to turn it on? what would prompt one to turn it off? this could be asked about ionizers in general, but it would have been nice if the instructions explained this.
 We always have a fan running in the bedroom at night while we sleep year round. The catch is finding one that will run for hours every night that has just the right amount of quiet "white noise" but still moves the air. This is the one. We've used this fan for the last two years (that's how long the last one lasted!) and so it was time to replace, but having tried out others at a local Target, we opted to go back to what we knew.<br/><br/>Nice solid build, nothing cheap feeling about it. Love the remote that comes with it. And one small detail that I love - there is actually a one-touch off/on button, rather than having to cycle through the speeds to find the off position ( and all the loud beeps that come with it!).
 Not a pain to put together but but barely puts out any air. I was sad to see that this fan puts out very little air. I run it on high all the time and it is barely noticeable. The round circulating fan is 10x better.
 This is my 3rd lasko tower fan and it performs pretty good. The fan noise is low but is noisy at we get to higher speeds. 3 speeds and you can control with a remote. Their is an option to set the time , which is what i like. The fan can turn off<br/>In 30 mins to 4 hrs if u use the timer.
 We really like the slim profile allowing us to tuck it into out of the way spaces in a very crowded office that needs ventilation but does not have room for a large footprint. Customers are grateful during crowded seasons and hotter temps here in Texas. A life saver. Only gave a 4 star on durability due to the occasional break from the stand. That is an issue we have had with multiple models though and only when moving it too quickly without care.
 We have used the lasko floor fans before this is our first tower type. It works great, the amount of air it puts through is fantastic. The fan is very quiet, can oscillate or stay in one position. The remote worked just fine and is very convenient, especially in the bedroom.<br/><br/>The base is sturdy though it could be a little bit bigger to be steadier on plusher carpet, but it isn't unsteady enough to be a concern.
 Decent fan for a few months until you try to clean it.  Then good luck.  It's impossible to clean.  I saw one review that  indicated cleaning is possible with a LEAF BLOWER.  I would have to concur that normal vacuums cannot clean this fan and the dozen plus screws on the back make any other attempts appear like they may jeopardize the structural integrity of the whole thing and probably the warranty.
 With the hot, hot summer we had, this fan was definitely put through its paces.  There were weeks at a time where it wasn't off for more than a few hours while we were out, and it never once gave us a problem.  Our house is not air conditioned (Virginia) but we have one window unit on each floor.  By positioning the fan so that it drew air from the cooled room, it made the next room pleasantly tolerable even on the hottest days.<br/><br/>Still not sure what the 'ions' do, but it didn't hurt anything.  The fan is not noisy (on low, it's downright quiet), the remote is handy and best of all, there was little to no impact on our electric bill!  The small footprint is what attracted me initially, and I'm quite happy with our purchase!
 This fan is perfect! Way taller than I thought it would be which allows it to really circulate air around the room. It's very powerful and very quite, better than those honeywell fans! It's even keeps my husky cool in this 100 degree heatwave.
 my room gets super hot during winter (i live in a dorm) - because when they switch to heating system the entire building gets super warm. and i dont even turn on my heater. anyway long story short, i used to open the window but the caveat of doing that is the loud noise interfering with my studies and/or if its windy, things fly away.<br/>so i decided to buy this fan.  I like it because its a tower fan and when Im studying at my desk i feel like it blows air from head to toe.  it doesn't take that much space, so you can easily put it in the corner.<br/>the only con is the noise, which is not that load, but if you want absolute silence for studying or sleeping, you won't have that.
 I had another similarly styled fan from Lasko. This works just as well and puts out even more airflow. The only downsides are (1) the low setting actually puts out more airflow than I expect/desire, (2) this model is fairly noisy.
 We've had this fan over a year. It's the best fan I've bought so far. It takes up very little room. It's unobtrusive tucked in a corner. The osclitaion doesn't require extra room. The height allows the air to cool us from head to toe. I have an array of other fans, including box, table and vornado* type. Those have been consigned to  garage storage after buying this. I don't find the unit very loud. On high, in the den,  I turn up the TV another notch to compensate.  Not bad, IMO.
 The second story of my house gets extremely hot in the summer so we leave the window open but if there's no breeze it's stifling. I bought this and it cools everything down and isn't too overpowering. Pretty quiet. Love the cool air it puts out.
 This fan is really nice. It looks great cosmetically and it works perfectly fine. It's not that loud on the lowest setting. I like sleeping with some noise and the highest setting works fine for me. I'm not sure if I can really tell if the Ionizer is doing anything. All I see is the blue light, but it never makes any sound or has any way to prove something is happening. It is definitely on the bigger side as it's slightly thicker in person. I would buy this again.
 This is my third Lasko Windcurve purchase in about 12 years. These fans have performed excellently, survived many moves about the county and look great in any room. I was excited to receive this fan because some improvements have to made that make the remote easier to use and the fan doesn't beep loudly when the settings are changed like in older models. I have recommended this product to my family and they now own two of these as well.
 For all the space this takes up, it's extremely weak. Nowhere near what the description suggests. It turned on at the highest setting, and I thought for sure it must be the lowest. But, no, just went down from there. Not too much more powerful than the trusty little 9" Holmes oscillating fan I got for $10 about 8 years ago. At about 10 feet away, it was barely noticeable. I think even right up close, it would barely be strong enough to blow a sheet of paper off your coffee table. Virtually no up/down control at all. Returning it.
 COOL BREEZE ! I had to sent to Daugther during the WILDFIRES in the NORTHWEST this year... She could not breath the air  and this help her at night .with a/c.
 Had an old one that served us well. This one with the faux wood tone looks very elegant, way better that the old one. The old one lasted 8 years. Disassembly for cleaning is not easy but we did it. Would recommend this blindly.
 We have been through a lot of fans.  Our last tower fan was very noisy and not in the pleasant fan kind of way.  This fan is perfect. I always use the ion feature.  If I had to say anything negative, it is that the blue light when the ion feature is on is so bright it’s like a nightlight.  If you need a nightlight, perfect...if not, a piece of electrical tape over it would remedy it.  The air out of this fan feels like air conditioning air.  I love this fan so much I tell people about it and often say I don’t know how I lived without this fan in my life.  It’s that good!
 Decent fan. Has 3 speeds but can hardly tell the difference in the airflow, just the noise. If you are buying this for the remote, don't bother. Hardly works. Have to push buttons numerous times to get it to work. Does the job but over priced for what it is.
 Fan makes an awful sound like someone taking a deep breath. Happens all the time. Might not be an issue if you have the fan just drying something or if it's in a room that's already loud, but it doesn't work as white noise for sleeping.
 This is a great fan. Bought a Lasko model like this 10 years ago and it's still going.  This newer model is even nicer looking and works great.  I use it to blow AC from one room to another and it works great.  Quiet, powerful, slim and a remote control.
 The fan works great, but there is not an easy way to remove the back so you can clean the filter. Therefore, whenever it starts to get clogged, you have to manually unscrew and disassemble the fan to get to the filter. Had I known this, I would have purchased a different fan and still might in the future.
 This tower fan works great. It keeps the house nice and cool.  I like the ionizer function because it quickly eliminates food cooking odors. It is quieter than the other tower fans I've purchased.
 Looks great just like the pictures.. also for the money the quality is great! The only issue is this little guy has a noisy humming sound when you operate it on full speed.. Overall I am happy with the quality and the look.. I ordered the brown one.
 The fan is OK.  It blows out air, but honestly I expected it to be a little more powerful.  Your standard circular fan blows out more forcefully than this one does, even on it's highest setting.  It's also VERY LARGE.  It looks thin and sleek, but it's a big fan so make sure you want this size.  You do get good vertical air circulation and it works as advertised.  Not sure if I would purchase again, there are probably better options out there.  Might be just fine depending on the need/situation.
 We are very pleased with our fan. Delivery was timely and without any damage to packaging. The fan takes up little floor space, is stable, relatively quiet, moves a comfortable, vertical column of air and, interestingly, seems to cool it! We had a number of 90 degrees+ days this past summer. Even so, the air emitted from the fan felt noticeably cooler than the room air. This is mysterious, much like the ubiquitous thermos that, "keeps the cold stuff cold and the hot stuff hot... how does it know"?!
 Looks nice, arrived quickly, quiet operation, too bad I can barely feel the air. I wouldn't consider using the low or medium settings because on "high" you can barely feel the air. Isn't that what a fan is for? Can't believe the good reviews. ALSO: Air ionizers are generally not harmful; however, it is important to know how much ozone an air ionizer produces. Lower levels of ozone are better; some ionizers produce 150 parts per billion of ozone. One hundred parts per billion is enough to cause lung damage in people with no lung or breathing problems. It is also important to not put air ionizers in areas that a person might sit or sleep for long periods of time, as this can cause a person to breathe toxic levels of ozone.
 I've had this fan for a while now.  I wish I had bought it years ago.  We use this in the living room which gets much hotter in the summer (because of it's proximity to the kitchen and laundry room which are constantly in use).  It has really helped cut down on our utility bill.  You can feel the air from 25 feet away.  I've bought a few cheaper fans over the years and none compared to this one.  I wish I had just put that money towards this one so I could have enjoyed the cool air this whole time.
 We have loved thid fan for the last three months but as of recently it has developed a clicking sound as if it is blocked in some way. Checked everything but cannot see anything interfering with theoperation of the unit. Guess we will await its failure or the point where the noise overcomes the previously enjoyable white noise aspect and replace. Disappointed after just a few months use and naturally just beyond the return timeframe. Reviews suggest ours is an outlier, if we can get a replacement i will update in as many months.
 My co-worker and I went halfsies on this fan for the office. It works GREAT! Keeps the office cool and purifies the air as a plus! It can fan the room (side to side), 3 speeds, timer. Easy to set up and use! We are in love and both of us have decided to buy another for home! highly recommend.<br/>Keep in mind that it is much taller than it seems like in the photo here. I'd say it's about 3' tall.
 I'll admit that I read the reviews and thought they were too good to be true.  But I bought this fan and figured I could just return it if it was terrible.  What I was looking for was a sleek looking fan that could cool a fairly big room and not sound like a World War II battleship was revving it's engines right next to me.<br/><br/>I have a large living room in my apartment that is the one room without a ceiling fan or air conditioner.  It also happens to have 6 giant windows that let the sun shine in and warm that room up from sun up til sundown.  My TV is also in this room and using previous fans or even an internal air conditioner (the kind that sit in the room instead of the window) didn't cool this room down much and made so much noise that most of the neighborhood could keep up with my favorite shows with me because the TV had to be so loud.<br/><br/>I thought this fan would be a perfect fit and after about a month of using it, it has performed better than I ever would have imagined.  The fan makes almost no noise.  The loudest part is that occasionally the base vibrates but just picking up the fan for a sec seems to fix this.  Power usage is way down in my house and whereas the room hovered in the mid 80's on a warm day, it's now down to the mid 70's.  This fan moves an impressive amount of air and even blowing right on you at full speed makes less noise than a small breeze outside.<br/><br/>It's also very sleek and unobtrusive considering it's size.  I have it sitting just off the doorway and if I didn't love what it did so much I wouldn't even realize it's there.  The controls and display are well sized and easy to figure out without reading the instructions and the fan can rotate if desired and still remains very quiet (if not the same).<br/><br/>Fair warning, I have not used the remote control or ionizer on this fan.  I'm not sure how you clean the fan if you choose to use the ionizer and can't comment on how well it works, but if you just want a way to cool a room off quietly and lower your electricity bills from your air conditioner then this is the best I've found.
 The fan works, and blows, but - after 2-3 hours of use, it started making loud noise. It is due to some fan parts inside - on the top, is touching other parts.<br/><br/>Tried to reach out to Lasko to have this fixed, three times, but not gotten any feedback. So I guess this will be a return/refund item...<br/><br/>Also - this fan has NO way to open and easy clean. A vacuumer is all that can be used from outside, so any dust build-up on the fan blades itself, not possible to clean.
 This fan is much better than a regular box fan. It does the job and was easy to put together. No it does not cool like an air conditioner, it's a regular fan. The blue ION light is pretty bright in my bedroom, but I'm not really concerned about that. So far is has been running fine for a few weeks. I like the fan, I like that it has a remote, would consider getting another if needed.
 I bought this about a year ago and it's one of the best Amazon purchases I've made. Haven't had any issues with it. I moved it as far as possible from my bed because I feel the "low" setting is still a bit strong. Remote worked great and from a good distance until I dropped it a month ago and it shattered (about a foot off the ground so be careful). Hopefully I can buy a replacement
 My house is very hot and this fan is a life saver. It keeps me cool, looks nice, is good quality, has 3 speed settings, a timer, oscillates and has a controller. Oh and it was super easy to assemble.
 Pros:<br/><br/>The fan is just about everything I expected. Looks good; has an ideal "white noise" sound, but not too loud either; the rotation feature works well. Seems like a good enough value - I think we paid $60 total.<br/><br/>Con (only one for me):<br/><br/>Remote is not very good, but does work. Have to point it directly at the sensor for it to work, and from not too far away. Pressing the buttons makes a clicking sound that is somewhat loud- wakes up my partner when I click away on the remote trying to turn on the fan at night from bed. Really don't want to wake her up.
 This fan is amazing!  I didn’t understand how a tower fan would do much good, but it manages to spread the air out, quietly and efficiently. There’s no beep when I turn it on or off or change a setting, which I LOVE!  This is going to make such a difference this summer.
 My main issue with this fan is that it is just too expensive. If I could give 2.5 stars, I would do that, but I had to err on the low side. It does everything it's supposed to do, but it's simply not worth $70. For that price, I would think it would be much quieter, and smoother when oscillating. Part of the reason I have it is for some white noise, so I'm not opposed to a little bit of sound, but I think this is just way too loud for the price. I also get some clicking when it's moving. Overall, it is technically doing the job, but I would say I'm disappointed because it should be about half the price.

It blows nice cool cool air I prefer this over my ceiling fan.
 This tower fan is just what we needed to circulate the air for some extra coolness during those hot summer days. It has a remote that doesn't have batteries.  You can do all the functions with the remote including oscillating! It's probably about 3 ft tall and doesn't take up much room. This fan is worth the money.
 Fan works fine, remote doesn't work at all. Tried three different sets of brand new batteries and pfft, nothing.
 The fan is exactly what we were looking for. It works great! The packaging could have been a little better, though. Upon arrival the box was smashed in a couple of places. When we opened it there were a couple of small dings in the frame (right where the box had been smashed in). They weren't obvious or even very big, and they definitely did not effect the operation of the fan so we did not return it. Overall we are very happy wirh this purchase. Thank you so much.
 Quiet enough to not be bothersome, but provides enough background noise to fall asleep to comfortably. It is lightweight so carrying to another room is easy. The remote works well. Overall love it, and we are thinking of purchasing another one.
 I waited to see how this would hold up long term before I wrote a review. After a year and half of very heavy use (I live in a warm climate) I can tell you, this fan works well, is quiet, efficient, and takes up a remarkably small footprint.<br/><br/>The fan is used constantly, every day and all night. It has been running flawlessly for a year and a half with no issues. If you need a fan to move a good amount of air and do so efficiently, this is your fan.
 Everything about this fan is good. Almost. There is a blue LED light that drove me nuts during summertime that masking tape did not solve. I ended up having to avoid using the filter feature that causes the light to turn on. Otherwise, this is an excellent fan that survived multiple falls due to stupid siblings and family members and is rocking well to this day.
 This is awesome! I desperately needed a fan for my room during the summer and now I have one! Keeps me nice and cool for those hot summer nights.<br/>It's kinda easy to assemble, you just have to be creative and use a chair or something to elevate the main unit so you can attach the base. Its not heavy but not light too. Guessing it's something like 20-30 lbs? Easy for me, but maybe not for someone else.
 This is the second Lasko tower fan we bought for the house and couldn't be happier! It comes with a remote if you need to adjust it from a distance, is tall enough that you can feel the air breeze everywhere and the adjustable power &amp; oscillation allow it to be fully customized to my needs! Awesome buy!
 Amazing! After dealing with the incredibly hot summer in Southern California I began researching tower fans. I am so glad that I picked this one! It is able to cool off the bedroom incredibly well. When we move it into the living room the air does not seem as cool, it is a much larger room, but the airflow is still very strong and refreshing. We have had many people ask us were we purchased this fan because they were so impressed with how well it works.
 Love the fan, provides a good amount of airflow, great for those hot summer nights and tall enough to reach you when you're in bed or on the couch. The remote is great, I would like to see light up buttons though so you know what you're pressing. Overall easy to use; haven't tried any timer settings but this fan is a life saver!
 After buying &amp; ditching several different brands of tower fans, I became convinced that using a tower fan in a bedroom meant accepting a certain amount of noise.  Purchased 5-31-11, this fan is the quietest &amp; most efficient fan yet, replacing my loud &amp; shaky Honeywell HY-022.  Lasko tower fans are more stable &amp; this model has a place behind the controls for your hand to easily grasp when moving the fan. I wanted a 36" oscillating fan with remote but settled for this 42" model. Changing speeds is a bit noisy, it beeps loudly while shifting but finding the right speed with remote is..a..breeze!
 Great product. I like this tower fan because it is pretty quiet. I was pleased with the simplicity of assembly which took a sum total of 15 minutes. It covers most any room with positive results. Very noticeable difference. I am probably going to buy a few more.  The Remote is very handy and has the right adjustments.
 I bought this fan hoping that it would be as "cool" as other reviewers had mentioned and it was! I use it in a bedroom that is on the second floor and it feels amazing! I am not home often and do not want to waste so much energy to cool down a 2 floor apartment when all I need is to be comfortable in that one room. I  had mentioned this fan to my boyfriend and he thought I was crazy. When he stood in front of it he couldn't believe it was only a fan! I am buying a 2nd fan :)
 This is a nice fan and I would recommend it. Blows cold air and is not super loud. It is taller than some other tower fans I've had, plus the vents allow you to point them up or down. I have not used the ionic function.
 Just received my tower fan and it was easy to attach the base.  Turned the fan on and it was quieter on HI than my old fan on LOW.  On low speed the sound is really low.  Not sure why the noise complaints in reviews.  We are very happy with the new tower fan.
 This is the third Lasko tower fan I've purchased and the first two are still fully operational. With a recent spate of 90-degree plus days, this fan does a great job of circulating a/c air from one place to another. It's relatively quiet and the oscillating feature and triple fan speeds, all managed with a remote control device, make this a really great product. I use one in my bedroom all night, every night, for cooling as well as blocking out noise. That fan is several years old and still runs perfectly.
 This saved me this summer in my place without AC. It provided enough cool air so I could finally sleep.
 Not as impressed as other reviews. This fan is somewhat noisy when on high, and has an annoying blue light on it. At 10’ away, I had a hard time getting the remote to work until I pressed the button about 3 or 4 times.
 Works great. It's pretty loud, though. I like having white noise while I sleep, so works perfect for me. If we needed it for the living room, it wouldn't work while watching TV because of the sound. For the price, though, it's a great fan.
 I waited a couple of weeks to post a review to see how the fan held up to nightly use. Sad to say, but it is making weird clicking noises (while on and off oscillating). I clean it regularly every 2 weeks due to living in the desert with a high dirt and dust intake. I don't think this will last but maybe 2 or 3 more months. Very sad I wasted the money on this.
 Nice fan.  Quiet, especially at low setting, while still moving a fair amount of air.  Fatter than some fans, which allows for a bigger blower inside, which contributes to its ability to move more air at low noise levels.  Somewhat flashy design, with its fake wood and shiny metal trim, and curved shape front-to-back -- not a minimalist design; doesn't fade into the woodwork.  Have owned it for only a month or so, and haven't heavily used it, as cooler fall temps are finally on the way.  So far so good, but I obviously can't speak to its longevity.
 I live in Cali and we have no AC. After reading multiple reviews I decided to buy 2 of these fans. Well, they work pretty good in a small bedroom when it is pointing directly on you.  In the future I would probably just buy a regular stand up fan. My $20 Stand up fan puts out way more air than these did. They are definelty not worth the $75+ bucks I paid for each. The remote is a nice feature but my husband is the only one that uses the remote. Again if you want to feel the air you will need to position it very close to you.
 I LOVE this fan. I bought a cheap box fan from Walmart, and it was nothing compared to this. Even though this sucker is pretty pricey, it was definitely worth the extra money. It's got a really strong air stream, with three adjustable speeds. I like how tall it is--it's pretty tall, but not *too* tall. I'm glad I bought this.
 I bought this fan about 4 years ago and I'm still very satisfied. It very quietly rotates and a strong wind that can be created by the fan. Did I mention how quiet it is? We moved across the country and the movers damaged the base of the fan. I was upset with the situation, but the fan still worked and it has continued to work 2 years after the move.  I like the remote and the different options the fan has. I'm very satisfied.
 Living in Southern California, my house has no AC. That being said, the house can get a bit warm in the summer. I use this particular fan in the living room and I can feel it from the opposite side of the room from the couch. I don't find it loud at all; in fact, it's quiet enough, but provides just the right amount of white noise for me. It definitely does not try to outdo the TV in terms of sound. Overall, I'm really pleased with this fan.
 This was a gift for my mother-in-law who has no air conditioning. It arrived in good condition. Required minimal assembly. She loves the remote control feature. It cools the kitchen easily when the air gets hot and humid. Although she has only had it a few days, she is very happy with it and she commented that it looks great.
 great buy.  it is not very loud, reaches across my large bedroom with good strong breeze.  easy to set up (tower and base come separate).  multiple speeds.  if any wish, love it to go 180degrees instead of 90 degrees but that's just being picky.  other fans i read didnt reach far and loud.  got 2 now and would buy more.
 This has been the hottest summer in my area. I live in a small, older apartment with no air conditioning.  In the past, I managed with a small and a medium Vornado fan to get me through the summer.  This Lasko has been a total lifesaver in terms of providing efficient air circulation.  Am very happy with this product!
 The fan works fine. It’s amazing because it was shipped in its regular box. The bottom of the box corner was mashed but nothing damaged.  The fan works very well.  I knocked off 1 star because of the way it was shipped.  It was not shipped like all of my products I receive from Amazon.
 This is one of the weakest fans I have ever used.<br/><br/>Is it nice to look at? Yes, is it quiet? Yes Does it move air? Kinda.<br/>My old tower fan that died out after 3 years of near constant use moved more air at the medium setting than this one does at high. Not worth the price at all.
 Recently moved into an older home and the AC isn't as good as I was used to.  We purchased the Lasko and I went from sweating at night, to being able to sleep in comfort.  Only issue for me is the blue light when you run it with the "ION" setting on.  The light is too bright for me to sleep, so I simply turn it off of ION at night, and let it run during the day.  This thing has been running nearly 24/7 since we bought it more than a month ago.
 I have set this fan in my living room and it has worked perfectly.  I have a chair across the room from it and I am amazed with the airflow put out by this fan.  With double cell blinds on my window and this fan I have not had to run my air conditioner at all (even on 90 degree days!) which means this fan will pay for itself in a matter of months.  The fan is very quiet and the sound that it does make creates a white noise that is relaxing.  I am very pleased!
 I desperately needed a fan for my workplace, in a large open room.  I've used a smaller tower fan at home for a few years, so I selected the Lasko 42" Wind Curve.<br/>Pros:  Good volume of air; effective height; minor disturbance of paper.<br/>Con:  It only swivels 90 degrees -- I had expected greater rotation.<br/>No opinion on the Ionization feature, no opinion on the remote control (I don't use the remote).
 Makes just enough noise so that it drowns out "house noise" and I can sleep. It's like a pleasant "white noise". The fan can rotate or not, has three speed settings, and an ionizer. You can also manually adjust the vertical flow of air. I love the remote too. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good, quality, inexpensive fan.
 We bought this fan during the heat wave that was spreading across California and we are so grateful that we did. The oscillating effect helped cool off our bedroom at night and the remote control was very nice. That way we could turn the fan on and off without having to get out of bed. It doesn't take up very much space and is pretty quiet while it is running. We would definitely buy this fan again if we decide we need fans for other rooms in our house.
 Product looks nice but not very powerful and loud. Priced too high for quality.
 I purchased this based upon the positive reviews on Amazon. I'm not impressed with this in the least. It's like you actually need to be in front of it to feel any breeze. Now granted it isn't an air conditioner so I do not expect cold air, but for the money spent I was expecting some. I've tried it in smaller rooms just to ensure I was being fair to it, but no go. So now it's been relegated to the closet as I don't have the shipping box that it arrived in.
 We like it in our apartment where space is limited. We face the west so we get the afternoon sun and rooms get a little warm, so the fan helps.We don't find it noisy but have not used it to sleep.<br/>Great value. Great air flow.<br/>The only negative is that the base is plastic (as it is the entire unit) and it is a little flimsy, hence the reason I gave it 4 stars and not five.
 A bit bigger than I expected but work greats. Minus one star because of the bright blue led light and the loud buttons. I use it for my 18 month old sons room at night and I had to cover up the light with tape and need to make sure to put it on a timer before he falls asleep because if I go clicking buttons it will wake him up. Hell hath no fury like a toddler who was awoken when he shouldn't have been...<br/>That being said I would purchase again. Just has some things I need to be aware of while using it.
 We bought this fan for use in our living room and it does a good job.  The remote is really handy, as is the timer function.  It is louder than a ceiling fan, but keeps the air circulating and is pretty darn quiet on the lowest setting.<br/><br/>I wish I could get it in a solid black or silver color, the faux wood paneling on the front is kind of cheesy.  Not a deal breaker by any means, just personal preference.<br/><br/>Overall it was a good purchase, and I would consider purchasing it again unless I can put a ceiling fan up instead.
 It works wonderfully. I installed it and put it on high and immediately passed out on the couch. However, it does make some noise, but not as bad as others have reviewed. I am worried this could worsen over time. Crossing my fingers though! Other than the noise and its potential to worsen, it is great and I am so happy I purchased this item.
 After 2 years of use I can attest that this is a quality fan.  I really like:<br/><br/>1) The quiet demeanor of the motor<br/>2) The remote when you wake up in the middle of the night and want to turn it on<br/>3) It looks sleek
 Better than a fan! We have a room on our house that gets much hotter than the rest. Rather than getting a bulky window unit, thought we would try this. It works great! The air movement is just enough to feel cool.
 I've been searching for an air mover fan to use in the background that didn't cause stress from the noise.  This fan seems to fit the bill. I can have it on the other side of the room and have a gentle air flow and completely forget it's even running.<br/><br/>This is a huge thing for me.  My wife will use it and forget that it is turned on too.  She normally hates fans with a passion due to the noise and can't sleep with them in the room.  This one seems to pass the sleep test.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>* Quiet (for a fan, there's no such thing as silent, but its pretty decent)<br/>* Small footprint<br/>* Light, easy to move.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>* It has a plastic base and would be easy to knock over.  (This is the flip side of being light and a small footprint)<br/><br/>We will definitely be buying more of these.
 Works fine -- only complaint is that the lights can't be dimmed at night. If I set a timer, with the Ionizer on, there are several bright lights in the dark. If you're a light sleeper that wants total darkness, this might not be right for you.
 Positives:<br/>* Fan is not heavy and can be positioned around the house easily.<br/>* Remote controlled. (I do not use the remote, I control it via voice using my Logitech Harmony)<br/>* Does a really good job in cooling the area<br/>* Good quality<br/>* Very quiet
 I just received my fan today and so far so good.  I purchased it to replace a honeywell tower fan that was making a horrid clicking noise whenever it was turned on.  The first thing I noticed before anything else is how quiet it is.  It does have a fan sound but the sound seems to be good for white noise.  In terms of fan power, I'd say it works as well as most tower fans.  If you want some sort of high velocity fan, this is not it but it does move the air around.  Its 85 degrees right now and I'm trying to hold off on turning on the A/C and so far so good with this fan.
 It came in a timely manner, but sadly box came already ripped. I was really hoping that the box was ripped but the fan itself would be fine. While putting it together it was fine until I turned it on. I turned it on and realized that the timer button was settled so deep in and broken. It could not be moved and it does not work. I want to return it, but honestly I purchased it online to avoid wasting time. It's too much of a hassle to return with a ripped box and all the bags all opened. I just wish it was handled properly.
 I bought this during last summer's heat wave in California. It held up to daily, near 24-hour use in my non-air conditioned home through the summer and well into November.  Noise levels were quiet enough for me to sleep through and to hold phone conversations while on during the day. I gave it 4 stars because the 90 degree rotation range was less than ideal for my room set up. The fan performance was great. The remote is a fun addition, however, I rarely used it.
 WOW!  I am totally impressed with this fan.  I've had at least a dozen different fans over the years and this is, by far, the best.  It's more attractive than the usual "stand" or box fan and pushes more air at half the noise level than any other fan I've ever had, plus takes up far less room.  The cost is a little higher but is worth it.  I DID have one slight problem, the remote sent with the unit did not work.  I e-mailed the Lasko Co. and they sent a replacement remote promptly and all I had to do was fax them a copy of my store receipt, not send them the defective remote so I didn't even have any postage to pay.  I am 100% satisfied and have been using it nearly 24/7 since I got it in mid July without any problems.
 I love this fan. One day the power went off and the fan also went off. I forgot to turn it back on. Later I was sitting in the room watching tv, and I couldn't figure out why it was so hot. Then I realized the fan was off. It's amazing what a difference this fan makes in the temp of the room.
 The air purifier actually does remove odors and leaves air smelling clean and fresh. Very efficient at cooling and a great overall design. Not as quiet as advertised, though. I wont complain, it's quiet enough, but as a light sleeper it still bothers me in my bedroom when I try to sleep. For any other room and during the day, it is perfect!
 It is a nice sized tower fan that was promptly delivered. Unfortunately, it is not as stable nor as powerful as my previous Lasko fan. I would stick with the older, slightly more expensive model, were I to buy one today: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005B3MDOC/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=2VS3TJ4D23EZ6&amp;coliid=I2OZB32WKG87MU
 It's relatively quiet, and makes a significant difference during warm summer nights. The timer setting is fantastic. My only qualm is that the blue light is extremely piercing and actually bothers me if I am trying to sleep.
 The fan works really good, and the ionizer is a big help to clear the air.  It does not blow the air at the speeds the round fans do, but seems get the same results the round fans accomplish.  If you want a fan that does not blow you over and works well, this is it!
 I'd give this a ten if I could.  We are having a heat wave and it's humid as well. This fan keeps the living room almost too cold. I have ceiling fans and oscillating fans but they scare my pets.  They've spent the last two days and nights sleeping in front of the fan.  Great product and great price.
 Came damaged, but was desperate for a fan, so kept it. I could live with it too damage.  Buttons don't all work so well by manually pressing, but the remote works well. Not a  high powered fan, but decent for small spaces.
 Doesn’t move much air, not very powerful.
 Really attractive fan that works well during the summer. Living in California where there is no air-conditioning in many houses this is great for those hot summer nights when there is no breeze.<br/>As I mentioned above it looks really nice also.
 As a warm-blooded, large man I often find myself struggling to find a fan to keep me cool at night without also being so loud it keeps me awake. After my last fan bit the dust I started searching for the perfect replacement when I came across the Lasko Wind Curve. This fan is nearly silent at the highest setting and circulates air better than any other fan I've owned. The only drawback I found were the extremely bright indicator lights but those were quickly remedied with a little electrical tape.
 I thought this fan was great until the noise started. Buy at your own risk. Looks like I will be buying another fan of a different brand. Really disappointed and not worth the price.
 This is the second unit I purchased, so obviously I like them.  They work very well, when they work.<br/><br/>But, the "on/off" control stopped working on the second unit after a week &amp; 1/2.  So you have to physically unplug to turn off the unit.  The remote control also ceased to operate.  I'd return but have already thrown away all the packaging, so I'll just have to live with the manual plug in routine.  So, if you buy, keep the packaging for awhile.<br/><br/>BTW, the first unit purchased continues to work perfectly after a year + of ownership.
 I really do love this fan.  It looks so sleek and modern.  The buttons and LED light make it very easy to operate and the remote control is great.<br/>(remote does not come with batteries). The fan is pretty powerful......I have it in a large bedroom and the level 1 setting is usually enough, even on very hot days.  The oscillation path is not that wide though, which is the only thing I don't like about this fan.
 I am not sure why people left some bad reviews for this fan.  It is amazing!!  The air blows out very nicely from about 5.5 feet away, I am using it on the lowest settings and never feel I would need it higher.  It of course makes noise, but it is low and does not prevent me from sleeping.  The remote is amazing, small and can be stored in the fan.  Has timer settings I can do from the remote.  Thinking about buying another one for my exercise room.  I would highly recommend this product
 This fan was only used for two days and although it produced a good amount of wind, it made an awful rattling/vibrating noise that kept us from sleeping. I would not order this product.
 ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS FAN!!! Do not ever buy this product from Amazon! Terrible Lasko product! Incredibly over priced and Amazon should be ashamed to sell such an unreliable piece of trash. Fan motor failed to work after 1 week of minimal use and oscillating motor makes horrible grinding noise as it tries to turn. I am so disappointed in Amazon, their customer service and Lasko for creating such a sub marginal fan. Only have a 1-Star rating because 0-Stars isn’t an option.
 The wife uses a white noise machine so I'm use to that type of noise. However, this fan makes a loud high pitch humming noise that will drive you crazy, especially if you are trying to sleep.
 This fan works really well. This is the second one I've purchased. My first one is still going strong.<br/><br/>However when I received my second fan, the base plate was missing the male half. I received two female halfs of the base plate. The fan can not work properly without these correct parts.
 This is my third Lasko wind curve fan. I bought the other 2 over seven years ago. I broke one by dropping it and this is the replacement. Here in Southern California I use them year round. The burl wood trim adds much to the design. They generate alot of air and take up a small footprint. The remote control is a great feature.
 My boyfriend and I bought this fan and received it in two days.  For some reason, our bedroom is warmer than the rest of the condo and we don't have a ceiling fan.  It was so warm, I wasn't even sleeping with a sheet and it just felt very uncomfortable in our room.  This fan has made a HUGE difference, even on the low setting.  The air really moves now in the room and I can finally cuddle up in my blankets.  The first night with this fan I fell asleep right away and slept through the night.  It looks very sleek and the remote is very convenient.  I have already recommended this to my coworker who is having the same issue with her bedroom that we were having with ours.  We are very pleased with this fan.
 This van wasn't our cup of tea, what I can see it being a great fan for General use. We wanted it for our dog that comes inside and lays in front of the fan, but this fans stand was too high.
 The fan's highest setting is not high at all. My small table fan blows harder and cools a room better than this fan. If you are sitting right in front of the fan, then you are good. I had this fan on it's highest setting and it never cooled off the room, even after a few hours. Same results in a bedroom that is small. I returned this fan after a few days. Pros, it is very quiet and the air it does blow is cool. It also comes with a remote, but I never used it.
 Like the fan a lot but feel the base is rather flimsy, especially when standing on carpet.  It hasn't fallen over but the base could be more sturdy.  Also, previous comments about the ION light; for those that really need a dark room to sleep the light is very bright and yes, a person can put tape over it.  But as with the base I think it's a design flaw, for those two reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.<br/>I would buy this fan again.
 Highly recommend...very sturdy, strong and quiet fan! I had bought a different tower fan as an impulse buy at the grocery store for $40...what a waste of money! This is such a great price for a fan that also has an air ionizer and it's easy to assemble. Just wish it had a wider oscillating rotation.
 GREAT fan. It's quiet, moves lots of air, and the Ionizer is a nice bonus. I like the remote. There isn't much to say other than it's a lot quieter than I expected.
 We have another one just like this one, which we use upstairs in a hallway. It is lightweight and quiet. This fan does not blow a huge amount of air, but enough to make your environment comfortable and performs it quietly. It also has a timer which shuts off the unit.
 I needed a fan for our bonus room that is over our garage that stays very hot in the summer. I turned the room into a gym and it became unbareable to work out in. I put this in and no longer have issues working out up there. It cools me right down yet it is still very quiet when it is working and even when it is osculating.
 The oscillation on this fan is very limited, definitely not what I expected as I have a Dyson and Black &amp; Decker and the oscillation is great.  Additionally, high on this fan is Black &amp; Decker and Dyson's low setting.  Nothing is felt unless the fan is positioned close to you or is on high.  I guess you get what you pay for.  On a positive note, it appears sturdy and was easy to assemble.
 This fan can move some serious air on its high setting. Best of all it is not an abrasively loud and obnoxious fan. Yes, there is noise and that is to be expected, but it is not that horrible rattle and blast from a box fan.<br/><br/>It oscillates well, the ion setting works, and the remote is convenient.<br/><br/>This fan was very easy to assemble and came with great packaging (not too much, not too little).<br/><br/>I have had the fan for a month now and am quite pleased with it - so much so that I have purchased a second one for my office.
 I'm not sure what the complaints are with the loudness of the fan. Even on the highest setting this fan is incredibly quiet. The output left me wanting more. It also does not have a wide range when not oscillating. The fan is very large, and very tall which works well for my use of it in the bedroom. Based on the other reviews, I expected more output but the product did not disappoint if you have a reasonable expectation. Overall satisfied with purchase.
 Helps to ventilate and cool down my media room.  The slim design would make it work well anywhere in the house. Love the fact that there aren't any fan blades exposed that my little ones fingers can get to.
 I bought two of these about a year ago for my mom's house, which is about a 90 year old brick house. I set them up by the AC vents to help with moving the cool air around. I recall last summer that she noticed an immediate improvement and was happy with them. I remember that I liked them aesthetically as well; they look nice. She recently had some health issues and I've been staying with her. I recently pulled these back out for the summer and I really like them, too. Some people would probably say they are loud, but I don't mind it -- it sounds like a fan and I find it kind of soothing. The remote makes sense and is reliable; the words and icons are large enough too that my mom can easily see what each says. These things are pretty dope and I recommend them.
 This Review is a little premature because I had it a short time.  if it turns out bad I will write another review.  to tell the truth I wish I would have got the Honeywell Fresh Breeze Tower Fan because it has a filter and ionizer. this only has the ionizer but no filter.  that is what I had before this was a Honeywell.  but last winter it got wet in the Rain and that was the end of it.  the only odd thing about this fan is the speed control.  if you have it on low and push the speed button it go's to High then medium then low again.  that is very strange.  I have my bed room right off my office and I use this to blow cold air from my air conditioner into my bed room door that works out very good for my uses.  before I got this fan I looked all over the internet at all brands and Reviews.  some people say in they're Reviews it only lasts a year or year and a half.  what I noticed on all brands and Reviews that most said the fan went out after a year or two so I don't think its this brand what I think is tower fans have shorter lives than most fans.  I think its the Tiny motor they use in them.
 Great investment into this.  It's quiet and powerful!  I live in North Texas where summer here is like living in the 4th circle of Hell.  Buying this allowed me to turn my thermostat down and run this fan in the room we are sitting in.  I run it in the bedroom at night because it's the hottest room in my house, and don't really notice the fan noise.  If anything it's nice to have the white noise on.  The blue light when running the de-ionizer is not as bright as others make it out to be.  They're just complaining.  If you're looking for a good powerful oscillating at a good price, this is for you!
 Fan works well but is louder than I thought and does not push as much are as expected. Not bad considering it was relatively inexpensive but would recommend a different model if you are looking for something quiet.
 This is my second time purchasing this unit. Both are working flawlessly! I'd have to say my favorite thing about this fan is that it's extremely quiet even on it's highest setting compared to my old oscillating fan. Both are used in bedrooms and if you like a little bit of white noise then this is what you want! So far both seem durable enough to last for years!
 It's a big fan with a small footprint that oscillates, moves a good amount of air quietly, and looks better than most. It requires some assembly (attaching the base) but anyone can handle 4 phillips screws.<br/><br/>Previous to buying this one, I have been using a small Honeywell HT-900 floor fan which is also one of the highest rated fans on Amazon, but even at it's much larger size, this Lasko makes less noise.<br/><br/>More air movement + less noise = 5 star
 I actually wish it made some noise as I love to fall asleep to white noise, they are very quiet.  Purchased one a few weeks ago and bought another which just arrived today.  Solid construction and powerful.  I live in an apartment with no central air conditioning and these are great for steering cool air from my living room AC unit to other rooms.  Remote works well.
 Love the look of the fan, but has to stay on setting 3 to feel anything. I bought it originally for my workout room but it ended up in the living room. Just not enough power.
 Works like a charm. Bought this when I was living in an apartment that did not have air conditioning and this was a significant improvement in the summer months.
 This arrived in great shape and works very well. Remote is a handy thing to have, too. Can turn fan on and off from bed! It is very powerful, even on low setting. This was a for my husband. One down side is that the seller did not put it in a shipping box, so when my hubby went home for lunch, he found it waiting outside. Surprise ruined.
 After 4 years the last Lasko wind curve has done all but give out. We ordered the exact same one. For a fan that price to last that long was truly amazing. Not only did it function well for most of those years, it did so even though we moved twice and smoked in the room it sat in. Truly easy to assemble (the hardest part was threading the cord through the gap) and sturdy.
 I do love these fans very much they move the air and it's not too fast , this is my second fan that I have bought for my bedroom the other one I have is in my living room in front of my AC this way I find I can run  the AC on low in both rooms kitchen living room and dining room stays very cool
 This is one of the best fans we have purchased.  It's relatively quiet and moves the air around extremely well even on low.  The remote is a good idea however we don't use it much.  I love the tower effect and seems to do what it's supposed to do however, with one exception, and that being the range from side to side isn't as wide as stand fans but it's quieter and that counts for a lot in our home.  Cost was reasonable.
 While not the most powerful or silent fan on the market, for the price I think this is a purchase well worth it.<br/><br/>It keeps my bedroom cool at night and if it gets too chilly I can use the remote to turn it off. It's very convenient.<br/><br/>I will say the lights are a little bright so if your sensitive some electrical tape over the display light will help. As well it's very tall so if you have a small room it looks large.
 I love the fan. It actually blows cool air and it's very quiet. It does rotate well. It is waist-high. Beautiful fan that adds flare to any decor. Would highly recommend.
 Excellent fan. Quiet, blows cool air, and the 3 levels make things very comfortable. Also reliable as we've had this for a couple years. Light enough to move around easily. Wish it were a bit better looking...don't be fooled by the faux wood trim...it definitely looks like plastic, and the gray color is boring, but the fan does its job quite well. It's not an eyesore in case you're wondering.
 I had more air moving with my farts in the room.  This is a little bitch fan.
 This is an attractive unit and as well as practical. It does not take up as much room as those big round fans. It is quite and circulates the air well. I use it mainly at night in the summer time. If it gets too cool... I have the remote right by me on the night stand to turn it off.<br/><br/>Update: I bought two more of these. So we now have three units. One for living room, one for each bedroom. Great product!
 Functions well, but not as powerful at highest speed as I had anticipated and therefore must be used in close proximity.  Aesthetics look great but is definitely bulkier than the picture portrays.  Timer and oscillation work well and are great utilities.
 I like this fan, and I think it does a good job overall. It looks good, runs silent and really helps get the air moving in my apartment-- but I can't help but feel they forgot to add the "high" fan setting.<br/><br/>When it arrived, there was a bit of assembly required-- you have to attach the base. Everything is wrapped up in plastic, so a lot of mess was generated. Other than that, putting the base on is easy and requires you to screw in six Phillips head screws.<br/><br/>The fan has a nice, slim profile and looks pretty good too.  The remote is a nice addition too. I think it does what most tower fans do- give a nice breeze. Don't expect rushing air or anything like that!
 Good quality product! I already had one of these (slightly more deluxe model) in my home in my workout room and decided to get one for my studio. Love this fan! It is quiet, has 3 speeds, ionizes and, if it is is like my first one, it should last for years! I think my first Lasko fan has been going strong for about 10 years!
 QUIET- its very quiet, probably the most quiet tower fan I have ever used/been in a room with. Even on high its not loud or intrusive. I used to have to turn the TV up over my last tower fan but I can finally listen to my tv at a normal level and stay very cool.<br/><br/>COOL- it does an amazing job of cooling the room down. it doesnt just blow hot air around and it doesnt overwhelm you when it passes by. i keep this near a gaming computer and i usually have to have a fan on full tilt to stay cool, this fan oscillates on low and im staying cool. I have no idea how this thing works so well. its like the tide going in and out, you cant explain that.<br/><br/>I spend way too much time reading reviews so i hope this helps someone reading through the reviews. BUY IT. also, buy it from amazon, other shippers are tacking on $10+ for shipping. thats just rude.
 I really like this fan. It's not too hot here in NorCal in the summer but there are days when it would climb up into the 90's and I find myself in need of a fan for my bedroom. The fan itself is pretty quiet and the air speed is more than adequate. It does get a little noisy at the highest setting however but that's probably to be expected. I'm not sure how much of a difference the energy saving feature makes but the electricity bill for the months of July and August (when I used the fan at least 2-3 days a week) versus September (when I barely touched it) were pretty consistent.
 I thought I had reviewed this fan some time ago, but apparently not. I have two of these fans in my home, one in a large family room and one in a large bedroom. This fan is so efficient and quiet that it will cool a large room on medium speed.  Even on low speed, you will get some pleasant air circulation for general comfort using the oscillating feature.  Depending on your room size and shape, you might find that you rarely need high speed. This is an excellent well made fan for medium to large rooms, and is highly recommended.
 fan has always been excellent at circulating air, excellent at remaining quiet, excellent breeze strength, and additional timer and ion features make it an outstanding product in my opinion. the base of the fan is a little light weight for my tastes, but makes the fan more easily movable. i have noticed it requires some cleaning on both the rear and front, but i have no problem maintaining such a great fan. for the price, this is a fantastic purchase! im actually glad i didn't spend more, because this is exactly what i needed. trying to live without a/c, and honestly circulating fresh air beats stale a/c every time. bottom line; this fan is a great product!
 I had a tower fan for over 8 years and it suddenly died and they didn't make it anymore.  So I searched and found the Lasko 2551, decided to give it a try.  It comes just needing to be attached to the base, which is easy.  It's nice and tall, so half the air isn't blown into the floor.  I use this fan constantly when I am at home, especially for white noise to block out other noise in the home and for sleeping soundly.  For me, the fan is almost too quiet.  It's sturdy, doesn't tip over easily, and has a nice cord length.
 Love this fan. You can set it to rotate or stop it at a certain point and I love that it comes with a remote. I like that it also has a timer on it.
 Preface:  5 Year Review!!!  Originally purchased to keep our home office a bit cooler ~ its been moved to our bedroom for nightime.<br/><br/>What You Should Know Before You Buy:<br/>♦ It easily cools 300+ sq ft.<br/>♦ Almost feels like a legitimate small air conditioner.  Does a great job of cooling!<br/>♦ Quite enough to sleep next too<br/>♦ 5 Years of Enjoyment without a single issue!<br/><br/>Conclusion:  We will continue to use until its last dying breath!  We have yet to need a 2nd one, and we move this if need be from room to room.  The 3rd setting is so cold, we actually keep it on setting #1 in the heat of the summer.  Keep our Electricity bills down, since we use this in our bedroom while we keep the thermostat higher than average.  Would not hesitate to buy a 2nd or 3rd should our children ever need one for their bedrooms.
 Good fan. NOT an A/C unit, but definitely helps to relive the temperature in the room. The remote makes it very easy. Fairly large. Bought two and do not regret it!
 I purchased this for my husband so that he may remain cool at night or in his office without having to listen to the noise produced by other fans. I love it too. There are three settings (low, medium and high), it oscillates, and is quiet (it's not like you can't hear it blowing, but it is an improvement from other fans we have had). We love it for the warm California nights when we don't feel like turning into dried fruit due to the air conditioning.
 The reason I bought this fan was because I own the two previews models and had no issues. However, this model has to be the worst. The fan became noisy within the first month of use. I would not recommend this model for purchase unless you enjoy talking, sleeping, or watching TV over loud clacking sounds.
 The fan arrived with the timer button caved in and not working.  Box wasn't damaged at all, so I assume this got past whatever quality control the manufacturer does before shipping it.  Didn't discover this until I had it all together.  I have three other Lasko fans in the house, all of which are working nicely. However, this fan was bought to replace two that stopped working after probably 5 or so years.  Returning this for a refund.
 Good design but that's it. It does the job if you're in a small room. However in a larger room like a living room the oscillation is too small..doesn't move left to right much. The fan speed isn't as fast as some other fans. And the wire is too small to plug in and move away from the wall. The look however is quite nice.
 We have several Lasko fans, but just lost one due to a lightening strike.  Had this one out of the box and put together quickly.  Was excited to have a working fan again until I turned it on.  It starts with a rattle, is loud while running and powers down with a rattle.  Sending it back.
 Seriously....i think this is a great fan. My husband stopped complaining about being warm at night. No more thermostat wars!
 Initially, I was disappointed because it doesn't "sound" like a fan.  I had it on its high setting and could barely hear a thing, assuming there was little to no power.  I then stood in front of it and was surprised at the strength of the breeze coming out of this quiet puppy.  The oscillation feature is terrific, sweeping nicely through a good sized room, and the ionizer is a nice extra.  It also looks pretty cool as an addition to the room, much more aesthetically appealing than a box or turbo fan, like a soldier in the room protecting you from heat.  A great fan.
 It works really well, is easy to set up, and did I mention it works really well? Most of the time I find that you have to keep these kinds of fans on all day long just to feel it, but not this one. It really heats the room and maintains the temp!
 The fan itself is excellent. Powerful and very quiet. Circulates a lot of air. However, I am taking two stars off for the terrible remote. It needs to be pointed directly at the very front of the fan or the fan does not respond. The signal and the line of sight needed for the remote is weak even by IR remote standards.
 I loved this when I first got it, but it only lasted at most a year before the efficiency decreased because of the internal dust buildup and occasional clumps of dust blowing out. I vacuumed the fan regularly but the air flow kept decreasing. I resorted to an air nozzle on a compressor. The clouds of dust coming out were incredible. It is fine now. I will just have to take to my garage every 6 months to clean it.
 Living in Las Vegas, keeping cool is a must. This fan is my third line of defense against the heat, 1) AC 2) Ceiling Fan 3) This fan.  While the output leaves a bit to be desired, it does move air about the room. I do wish it were more powerful, but the job gets done.
 So far so good. I took it to work since I work out of a room specializing in hair removal. And it gets a little warm in there with the window even though there is air conditioning. So far two of my clients the same day wanted to know where I got it so it seems to be making quite an impression. I'm looking forward to experimenting more with the negative ion feature.
 I researched and read reviews on tower fans for what seemed like hours last summer and never bit the bullet and bought one.  I decided I was doing it this year.  My fan arrived approximately a month ago and I am kicking myself for not doing it last year.  I LOVE this fan!!  One of the things that sticks out in my mind is a review that I read that said something like "it seems to cool the air somehow, not just blow air around"  and I remember thinking that was just silly but so many reviews were so good, I just went for it.  I'm telling you, this fan really feels like it cools the air!  It does an excellent job of cooling a room down.  I have a new home with lofted ceilings and there are some dead spots that just need a little help.  This fan does the job.<br/>I will also say, I have two grandchildren who are just learning to walk and I find great comfort in having a fan that I feel is much safer to have around them.  I am ordering a second one for an upstairs TV room, (It's quiet enough that it won't cause any problem).<br/>If you're on the fence about ordering this fan, go for it!  I don't think you'll regret it!
 I have had the fan for two days but love it already. It is not loud and circulates the air great.
 Works great!  Could blow you out of the room if you wanted it to.  Even though I knew the dimensions before purchasing, I was surprised by how big this fan 'feels' in place (maybe it's just me).  Still, we love the fan and it does a terrific job of cooling the space.  I didn't think the remote control would matter but it does!  We use the fan in the bedroom; being able to adjust the speed without leaving  the bed is really quite handy.  Highly recommend.
 Monterey hardly gets "Hot" weather but this last month and present have been brutal. I truly enjoy my Tower fan and I do recommend it. If I have any negatives, it would be that I wish it had rollers to move around to different rooms. I'm 5'1" and though it is light, I have troubles picking it up and carrying it elsewhere. It does have a hand hold but it doesn't give me much leverage to lift and move.
 I bought this fan after my son and his girlfriend showed me the one they bought. I loved the idea of a tall fan instead of the old box fan I had. This did not disappoint. It's very quiet, even on the highest setting. The remote is great and you can adjust the options or turn it on and off from the comfort of your bed or couch. Easy to put together, I did it myself in just a couple minutes. Very happy with my purchase.
 Very similar to a previous Panasonic that it replaced.  Like all the towers we have purchased over the years, you really can't get to the fan blades for deep cleaning.  So sooner or later it's destine for replacing, unlike the typical non-tower models we've had for eons. Best guess it'll last 2-4yrs of constant use during the  summer months.  It is stylish, i must admit..  Still don't know what the "Ion" button actually does so never use that one.  The rotation is not as far side to side as the panasonic it replaced but seems adequate for our use.  Overall a decent tower fan...
 It does everything you would expect from a pedestal fan. This is my first Lasko buy and I have noticed that their products are good quality in comparison to other manufacturers of fans. We keep this fan in our bedroom or some time in living room and it can easily throw air to a 5-10 ft distance. At night we have to normally keep it in lowest setting. It's swivel function works smoothly and it has a calm white noise sound. We are happy with this buy and would buy again Lasko product.
 When I received my fan it was dead out of the box! It simply did not work. I contacted Lasko customer service, explained the situation and was instructed on how to obtain a replacement, which arrived quickly. The 2nd fan is working well and I'm satisfied -  but what a hassle! I suppose some Chinaman was distracted when assembling the original unit (didn't make an electrical connection or solder properly) causing the faulty fan. Anything can happen. I gave a 3 star rating considering the whole experience. If I received the "good" fan in the first place, I would have rated it 5 stars.
 Best fan ever. We did have an issue with the first one delivered and it stopped after just a day but return was prompt and had the new one in 48 hrs. It really moves the air and the oscillating feature is great. We are in an old house and have  lot of fans to move the air but this is far and away the best one of them all. If we replace any of the others this will be our choice.
 I bought this item on May 28th , 2017 .<br/><br/>As of two weeks ago the fan has stopped blowing air to the point , you have to have the fan up close next to it ; in order to feel anything.<br/><br/>I bought it to keep my room cool at night, and it lasted for a good month .
 Love that you are able to control the oscillation from the remote. However, I wish that this was a more powerful fan. What I mean, I can have it on the highest setting and not really feel a difference from the lowest setting. This is defiantly not a fan that will "blow you away." This is a  fan if you are looking for a somewhat quiet fan that doesn't take up too much space. Oh, and there's a place to store the remote on the fan! NO MORE LOST REMOTES!
 So Far So Good....Plenty of wind power and the Ionizer is a nice touch. Bigger than the other Lasko fans Ive owned in the past, heavier duty made....if it last as long as the others Ive owned I'll be a happy man.
 I have several Lasko heaters and mini tower fans,  so I bought this one with confidence. I was very disappointed. It's gigantic and I get barely a breeze if I'm more than 4 ft away. Too expensive to return.
 It'll be almost 2years with this fan soon, and it works great. I literally use it all year around. In the winter months my room gets really hot(and I don't even use the heating unit) so I use it on the level one setting and it helps me sleep. During the summer months I go between level 2 and 3 and its perfect. Its a nice strong fan that doesn't make a lot of noise. I've even used it in the living room and it cools the whole room down while rotating.
 Put this on an iPower rheostat in my grow tent, perfect. The stand is high enough so the air flow is just above the edge of my 10 gallon grow pots.
 The remote broke after only a week. The fan itself still works great after a couple months, but the fact that the remote lasted for *such* a short time know knocks a couple stars off.
 Great fan!! After must research, I went with the Lasko because it seemed to have the best of all worlds; price and reviews seemed to match up with what we wanted! We were having trouble with air conditioner and this helped to solve the problem! Blows cool air evenly, and quietly. Haven't used the ionizer much, reviewers made me nervous about bad side effects. Very happy with purchase!
 This fan is exactly as described and very quiet. But if you've had the Lasco high velocity tower and you're looking for a quieter option, this isn't it. So, for me this Lasco is short on air output. You can barely feel the air unless you're within 10ft. The high velocity fan you can feel from 20+ feet. If quiet is the priority this one is better than the high velocity version. Maybe they can make a fan that gives you the option to turn on high velocity when the quieter velocity isn't enough. The only reason for 3 stars is because I think they should make the differences very clear for brand loyal consumers.
 This fan was a huge disappointment.  For its size it is pretty quiet but that is only because it does not put out anything close to what you would call cooling and/or fanning air whatsoever.  I have fans that on its lowest setting fans more than this thing in high.  I don’t think it could put out birthday candles.  Returning ASAP
 It started off great, was quiet and did what a fan does. But then, maybe 3 months into owning it, it starting making these rattling noises. They would happen once in a while, so I ignored it. Now, maybe 4 months later, it makes the rattling whirring noise every night. It's driving me crazy as it comes and goes every 5 seconds. I'll stick with a traditional fan from now on as I've gotten tired of smacking it in the hopes it shuts up and lets me sleep. Not satisfied at all given the price of this unit.
 I use this every day and really enjoy it.  It is quiet and in a number of months has given us no problems at all.  You do have to be in front of it in order for the remote to work....and I mean directly in front of it and aiming well!  All of the features work as advertised.  Great product and a life saver on hot days when you need to get some air circulating.  We use it in our family room and it does a great job.
 Rotates and has panels that adjust the angle of air being blown. Also catches a bunch of dust. Love this thing! But wish you didn't have to plug it in the wall.
 A bit noisy - constant humming makes it difficult to sleep with this fan running (Ion feature on or off). Also, fan is not as strong as I had hoped (even running at max).
 Excellent fan! It doesn't slam you with air because it moves more air in a wider (taller?) column, which actually seems to have a greater cooling effect than standard fans. At first I thought it might be under-powered but I've come to appreciate the large amount of air it moves.
 I had high hopes for this fan since it was so highly rated. I’ve had a Lasko fan for years without issue. However, this one just didn’t work out. Overall, it is extremely quiet, which is probably a plus for most people, but I was actually looking for a good “fan noise” for sleeping. Ultimately, what made me return it is that it made a high-pitch electrical whining sound, no matter what setting it was on, which was very annoying.
 Waited to review to see if I’d have any of the noise problems I read about in other reviews. I have not. No clicking or anything. This fan keeps my room cool while I sleep and the little bit of noise I hear from the fan, I actually find soothing.
 I love this fan. It is quiet, and puts out plenty of air. I was a little surprised at its size, however. It's considerably larger than I thought it would be. My wife thinks that it is a little gaudy and overbearing, but I like its appearance and think that it adds to the living room. With the fan on I'm able to turn the AC back and remain very cool. It's definitely an improvement over the standard fan it replaced.
 As mentioned by others, it isn't a very strong fan.  It is okay if the weather is in the 80s but when the weather is in the 90s it is not enough.  It would be best to get those round fans with actual fan blades which may not be stylish but does the job this one can't.
 Makes a clicking sound when it oscillates. Not very quiet. I can hear the fan working loudly. Blows air okay if you are on top of it, but its really that great for whole room.
 Very quiet fan. I thought just having 3 settings would be an issue since it was replacing one with 7, but in fact, with the dual vertical zones and the 3 settings it creates more air flow than the old one ever did, without the noise. Remote works well but as mentioned is fairly directional. Not sure about the "Ion" feature as it wasn't a requirement/decider for me. Sturdy enough, cool and quiet!
 absolutley love this! very quiet even on high speed. I normally run it on low and it keeps the air moving. I love in Florida and have AC of course, but my living room had hot spots. I don't have a ceiling fan because of the high ceiling and they can be a pain to keep clean. This Lasko 2551 Wind Curve Platinum Tower is the perfect solution. Even my dogs laying on the floor enjoy it!
 Puts out good breeze, although you have to be pretty close to it to feel it. Has been working flawlessly for over a month of near-constant use.
 This is my 2nd one.  It is a terrific fan.
 I've had this fan for several weeks now and I wish I had bought it several months ago! It is quiet and performs very well, cooling the room very nicely. I've only set it on the lowest speed so far since that works well enough. It was easy to put together too. I often leave it on all night long.
 We've had this for about a month and have used it every night. It's great! The low setting is just loud enough to give us white noise, the medium setting isn't too loud if we need a higher setting. It's pretty sturdy, we move it around a fair bit between the bedroom and living room and it holds up well.<br/><br/>The only complaint is the remote. You really have to push the buttons in order to get them to work, and it makes a very annoying clicking sound.
 I purchased this fan for my dining / kitchen/ living area. i have a very open floor plan but a slender walk way area for me to plug a fan into and didnt want a bulky traditional fan.  I am very pleased with how little space this takes up but with how powerful it is! i dont really use the timer on it, and have only used the remote a few times since i walk by it constantly plus its just one more remote i have to store but i can see how the remote would be nice for others to use! after having it since april i have noticed a slight rattle sound to it, not too noisy but when i first got it you coudlnt even tell a fan was on! it works great oscilating since i use it sometimes to cool off my kitchen &amp; dining area also.<br/>the biggest Pro for me is that my husband and i are smokers and at night time we tend to be lazy and smoke indoors.. this completely elimates the smoke odors! i use to be able to smell the smoke myself if i came into the house and that is not an issue anymore!<br/>the only cons are: 1 the slight rattling noise, which isnt a big deal but is noticeable to me now, perhaps would go away if i could get into it and clean it, which leads to con #2.<br/>i cant get into it to really clean it. the front is a bit tricky to really clean. you pretty much have to go in between each little peice to get it dust free etc.. other than that i love it and am contemplating replacing the other 3 bulky old fashioned fans i have in the bedrooms with these!
 A good strong fan that gives a solid breeze and cools a room well! The reason for four stars is that it's not that quiet. It's fine for daytime but I'm a light sleeper and I know that this would wake me up. Also, only 3 speed settings so not a lot of variety and the timer is one button but goes through everything from 1/2 hour to 4 hours in half hour increments. The remote works well and has all of the buttons from the top of the unit
 I owned one of these already and loved it, so I bought a second. We have one in the bedroom and one in the living room. Both work great, no complaints. I love having a remote so I can turn this on/off, speed, rotate, etc from bed and from the couch. Highly recommend.
 This fan looks great but even at the strongest setting i can barely feel any air coming out. I've purchased a Lasko fan before that worked amazing so I'm not quite sure if I got a dud or what. So bummed!! :(
 As with most large tower fans I've had experience with, the circular base is plastic, and feels somewhat fragile. But the airflow it puts out is decent, if a bit loud. It looks nice, though—much better than the white ones that eventually turn yellow and cake with dirt.
 This fan doesn't have as wide of an arch of oscillation as some of the tower fans, but the remote control and place to store the remote are very nice. I got to circulate air in my basement with the ionizer on, so hopefully the air will stay fresher. It doesn't blow super hard (not as much as an old fashioned cheap box fan) but it is quieter, takes up less space, and aesthetically a lot nicer! And the ionizing is a nice bonus.
 works great and very quit. After a few months the dust starts to build up on the blades and it needs a thorough cleaning but that with any fan. Its not a quit as it was originally was out of the box, but still excellent item.
 I've had this fan for just over a year, and it has worked ok until a few days ago.  There was a popping noise coming out of it, and when I look through the back panel, there was an intermittent spark happening internally.  I unplugged it and haven't used it since.  Not sure if these are prone to catching on fire, but I'd rather not take the chance.  Up to now, the fan worked well, but I would expect it to last longer before having issues.
 All of you who take the time to write the reviews were on the money with this fan, it works great and has all the features anyone would want. The remote is such a nice feature, price is great and all the functions work well. Its looks are oustanding and fits right in I believe with any enviroment, works silent doing it's job. Very happy with it, always great shopping at Amazon and being able to make an informed choice and being happy with your purchase makes it all a great experience. Now eyeing another one for the bedroom, keep the air moving with this one.
 So far I love this fan! It’s very powerful, even on the lowest setting, and it is SUPER QUIET. I sleep with a fan on for white noise, but am glad this one isn’t noisy because it’s perfect for when you’re trying to watch TV.
 Item arrived on time but was, apparently, a returned item. I unboxed, plugged it, and it works so I'm not returning it. I guess I just expected to be getting a brand new item when I bought this.
 This piece of crap had some sort of short in it.  We got it all set up fine.  It would shut off in the middle of the night.  I made sure it wasn't on timer the next night and as soon as I climbed in bed, it shut off by itself.  I immediately turned it back on by remote and it ran all night. A couple nights later, it wouldn't turn on at all no matter how many different outlets.  Another day it turned on just fine and ran for 5 minutes before shutting off.  Then it completely stopped working.  What a WASTE of money, I should have just gotten another cheap oscillating fan that would have lasted for the next 5 years.
 We moved into a new house that didn’t have ceiling fans in two upstairs bedrooms. It gets really hot here in the summers and I thought these fans may be temporary until we got ceiling fans. I like them so much I won’t bother with the ceiling fans. The sound is quiet but just enough to be calming while you sleep. And it has really helped regulate the temperature during the day so it’s not so hot upstairs in the evenings. Definitely worth the price!
 We bought it in the beginning of summer. It’s placed next to our piano and mainly used at the time my daughter plays piano. That room is relatively low in ventilation so need extra help to cool the kid down. Great product at this price. Durable. Good function. We have used it over entire summer and it still functions well.
 Very, very quiet. I've only had it for one day, but so far so good. Easy to operate and nice breeze. It is great to use when you don't really need the AC.
 I got this for my boyfriend as a gift for his new apartment. It's a very good fan and can cool down a decent sized area. The things I didn't really like was that the box it came in was very beat up and that the fan is kinda loud, it wouldn't bother me but I could see how it could get annoying to others. The assembly was very easy and I like how it came with a remote. Hopefully he ends up liking it!
 This was a great fan, at least when it was working. Unfortunately after owning it for just over a year after the warranty expired, it stopped working completely. Not sure what went wrong but when we tried turning it on after coming back home, it just wouldn't work. Now we are stuck with a useless fan that we spent $60 for. We will try and see if Lasko can help us and will update if anything happens but we aren't betting on anything.
 This was a good purchase.  It has different settings for the speed and a timer.  You can set the air flow to go straight out or set it to an up or down setting. It has an ionizer setting. It comes with a remote.  At first I was afraid that the fan was going to fall because it felt a little flimsy but that is not the case.
 Ignore negative reviews. I live in south Florida and this fan blow cold/cool air. While the air isn't ac cold its definitely cool like the best side of a pillow.
 Wow, an awesome product. This is a tall fan but a nice, streamlined design that looks nice in the corner of any room.  And it works good.<br/>When you turn it on the very first time, allow it to run at low for an hour to "prime" it and then it runs very quiet.  Love the little remote control, too.<br/>Great product, just like their space heaters.
 I bought two of these about couple of years ago for my two children for their bedrooms to use in summer in addition to AC. Both seem to like it. The fans still work. There are different speeds of airflow and it either can blow in one direction or move.
 BUY THIS! I reluctantly purchased this fan after buying Honeywell QuietSet 8 speed fan from Target (about $10 more than the Lasko). The Honeywell fan started giving me an issue with rattling sounds after about a month. It was so obnoxious I couldn't even sleep with it on, which was the whole reason for me buying the fan in the first place. I was worried this was just an issue with all tower fans, however I decided to return the Honeywell and purchase the Lasko 2551 Wind Curve Platinum Tower Fan from Amazon. I was hesitant because of the hassle of returning an online item if it started giving me the same problem. But I've had this fan for a few months now and it's nothing but perfect white noise for sleep, also it has a very sturdy base which i think was my previous issue with the Honeywell. Great circulation and I'm a fan of the ION setting to clean the air in the bedroom of my apartment. I highly recommend this product, 100% pleased with its performance. If you're on the fence, BUY IT!
 This is a great fan for the price! I can definitely tell that the Ionizer is working to clean the air as well. Perfect for this 100 degree weather and lowering my electric bill!
 My poor old second hand fan died and I decided to treat myself to a brand new one. I did a lot of research and comparisons and I'm SO glad I chose this one. It's much taller than I realized so it already has a "higher" capacity but it's mighty powerful overall yet VERY quiet IMHO. The design of the gray and faux wood grain makes it much easier to incorporate into a room. Yes, it's a fan but it doesn't look like a FAN!! in the corner. Works great, looks good. That's cool with me! Highly recommend it.
 I love that it is slim and I can use anywhere around my house. It gives extra fresh air. My brother and I always have to fight for it.
 This thing is a monster and will move plenty of air.  But the rotating radius is pretty weak.  45 degrees.  I expected more turney turney.
 Wanted a fan that would be big enough for a bedroom, but that I also didn't have to constantly worry about my toddler sticking his fingers in or pulling it over on him. When I was looking at these, my preschooler said, "That's the fan they have at my school." I can totally see why - works great, good breeze, very sturdy and no concerns about the baby being able to get his finger in it. Also was super easy to set up - literally a screw driver and 30 seconds was all it took.
 My son's room gets hot and he loves this fan, especially not having to get up because of the remote control. Many settings and can hold still or oscilate. He loves it.
 one of the best fans I've ever used
 It's hard to get excited about a fan and I don't write product reviews very often but this thing has been great. I have trouble sleeping without a breeze blowing and after we bought a canopy bed, a ceiling fan was no longer an option. This has been just what the doctor ordered.<br/><br/>Really didn't think I would care about the remote feature, but I was wrong about that. I don't think I would buy another fan that didn't have one now. The timer options are nice too. Can't say much about the Ion thing...I don't really believe it does all that much, but doesn't detract from the rest of the fan in any way, so all good.<br/><br/>Only two slight improvements I would recommend: the low setting is not quite low enough. I have it sitting about 8' away from the bed and it will still generate a pretty brisk breeze even on the lowest setting. The remote has to be in direct line of sight to work (I mean like with a laser level line of sight). So, if you have it oscillating, you'll have to wait for it to spin back around to where it's facing you before it picks up the signal. All in all though, very satisfied with it and would certainly recommend.
 I love this fan. I have been using it for about 3 years and now that I am in an apartment without AC, it has made a huge difference. I really appreciate it's power and the noise. It is not loud, but perfect for those who like some white noise at night.
 Great help with the few hot days/nights in a Southern New England seashore town.  I hate to pay the electricity and cost of a small window a/c unit for less than 20 really hot days/nights.  This fan is perfect for my 14'x20' studio.
 Have had this fan for over a year now. Works fantastic. Remote works great. Have had no Issues with this product.<br/>At times i act unwisely when severely irritated. More than once I've picked up and thrown the fan when upset. Usually over a Horse Race honestly, it never has phased or damaged the fan. Very Durable! Now I'm working on Not Throwing it.
 I have the 4443 model, which is smaller in size with 2-3 times more wind power.  The 2551 is much bigger but not nearly the same horse power as the 4443 does in the same room that is about 18 ft long.  I plan to return this big fan and get a second 4443 model.  Not happy with 2551 at all.
 I purchased this fan for a small attic bedroom that only has one vent for the AC. It is the best fan that I have ever owned. The temperatures so far this summer have been in the 80s and 90s, but with this fan on the highest speed, it has been cool enough in my room for me to still sleep with my comforter/duvet. Only when it was 97+ degrees this weekend was the fan not sufficiently powerful for me to sleep with a comforter--but I still used a blanket.<br/><br/>I find that while the airflow is powerful, it is not uncomfortable when directed directly at me. The noise is discreet and assembly was easy!<br/><br/>Overall a great purchase. I have already recommended it to several friends!
 I've slept with a box fan on for the white noise for many, many years.  This fan, on the high setting, provides enough white noise for me to sleep but moves way more air!  It looks SO much better in the bedroom than the old box fan and I love the convenience of the remote.  No going back - this is definitely worth the higher cost!
 Am very happy with my Lasko Wind Curve Tower Fan!  I have it in my bedroom, where I like to read my books, and it is very quiet and gives out cool air!  Just love it!  Thank You.
 Love it! My sister and mom bought one each. I was surprised the tower fan had so much power little to no noise - I was able to sleep through the fan noise and I wake up to any little thing. It kept my bedroom nice and cool. Easy to assemble the base. It has a remote but no batteries. I love it! Thinking of buying another one for my living room.
 Keeps a very warm FROG in the summer very cool. Its quiet and efficient and feels great. Great design, tall enough to get the air moving in the while room and I would buy another one for outdoors on the Patio or Living room.
 Have owned this about 4 weeks and it has started to make a strange clicking sound. Will return it and get another one. Works well when its not making an audible sound. Double checked all connections and everything is ok. Thankfully I got the extended warranty.
 This is the second Lasko fan that I've purchased.  I've had the other one a little over a year without any problems.  They both move air well even on the low setting.  They are quiet and so far I've been very pleased with the purchases.  Would recommend them to others.
 Bought this to replace the one I had for several years. Appears to be a upgraded model and much nicer. The fan is a little noisy but moves alot of air on any setting.
 no guts no glorious breeze.  I spent a little more for this fan thinking would be what I needed. But t he only think I like about it was that it is a tower fan. the remote control only works sometimes and I get more power out of my old fan that is only half the size. Don't recommend this to anyone who  would like to feel the breeze.
 This was a gift. The recipient said it works great.  Have seen it cheaper from other suppliers so check the price before you buy.
 This is a good fan to use in the bedroom for night time air movement as it is quit and not disturbing when you are sleeping.
 This works and it highly versatile. It stinks though. Took one star off due to smell-- I am waiting for the smell to go away... after over a month.
 This is a great fan but it only has three settings for blow strength. At its lowest setting, it still puts out a pretty strong gust of wind.  I've docked a star because there are times when I want to decrease the power of the fan below its lowest setting.  Otherwise, I'm satisfied with this product.<br/><br/>I'll also add that the LED isn't so bright has to light up your bedroom at night.  That's a big bonus for me.
 I have had several tower fans over the years and these have to be one of the least air flow producing fans. Even on the highest speed of three, the fan has to be approximately 6 feet or less from you in order to feel the air flow.
 I bought this at a really great price ($49).  I've used it for a year  now, and attempt to vacuum it with a Dyson w/ attachments every other week.  The deep interior mechanism that spins to produce the air flow is filled with dust. Dust is trapped in other parts of the interior also.  There is no way to get inside this fan to clean it.  A leaf blower, as suggested by some,  is not a feasible option for me.  I have owned a few fans through the years; operating in the same room as this one (with a HEPA air filter).  Sadly, this has been THE WORST dust accumulator.
 I messed it up trying to assemble it<br/>which is very easy to assemble second time<br/>  5 minutes or less part of the customer assembling<br/>Buy from Amazon just send it back because if not for Amazon<br/>We will be unable to take a risk<br/>Machines pretty quiet except very little space using much better flow of air than a regular fan
 I use it for background noise when I sleep. It’s perfect minus I wish it had one more setting. Making it 4 diffferent speeds. But I love the ion selection. I use this every night even when it’s raining outside lol
 Nice breeze generated.  Love the remote as the unit sits at the floor of my bed, so easy to optimize while in bed.
 Awesome fan fits in a limited space.  Daughter runs it every night.  The handy remote is a huge plus since I have a competing fan that I have to get up and physically turn it off.
 Over 80 degrees in your bedroom but you can't use an air conditioner? This is gonna be as good as it gets. The airflow is heavy enough and concentrated enough that I can actually fall asleep in such unbearable temps. Fantastic unit.
 This thing is really awesome!  Lasko makes the best standing fans in my opinion.  It does a great job of cooling, and the ability to aim the air up or down is very helpful.  I love how quiet it is compared to most fans, and the fact that it can be operated with a remote.  On top of all that... it takes up almost no space!!  If you are looking for a standing oscillating fan, look no further.
 this tower fan is pretty weak to my old one. it does the job and circulate the air but not strong enough to cool my room which has the most sunlight heat so using in a room with the least heat issue and is okay. not great. would like better.
 It's stylish and has high air flow but that's about it. The ionizer light is pretty bright for night time use. It had an irregular rattling noise that made it difficult to sleep if used in the room. Woke me up throughout the night. Returned
 I needed a quiet source of cooling air in my office that would not make noise over the conference calls that frequently make. This Lasco 2551 Tower Fan does exactly that and gives me the choice of ion emission to freshen as it cools. My sensitive speaker phone does not hear it (on the lowest setting) and I'm kept cool. Just what I needed!
 The fan is much quieter than some of the reviews I read led me to believe.  It moves a lot of air and the remote is very convenient.
 Update:<br/>I loved the fan so much that I ordered a different model for another room. The 42 inch is great for a big room. I bought the 36" for a smaller room and I'm in love with the quality. The fans are silent even on the highest speed and blow a lot of air even on the lowest speed.<br/><br/>From when I bought the 42": It is an awesome product. It's pretty silent and powerful. I am extremely satisfied. Would definitely recommend it.
 I LOVE this fan.  My old bedroom fan was a round one on a pedestal.  I am so glad it quit working and I had to replace it.  This fan is lovely.  Absolutely perfect for my needs.  Just the right height for my bed, it blows the air across the surface of the bed. Definitely recommend this fan.
 My mom bought it for her room 6 months ago n it comes w a remote n still works great i might buy same one for summer
 This fan works well. Disappointed with it's limited oscillation range of about 45 degrees. Low speed is not REAL low and High is not REAL high.<br/>It's OK. The fan is half blind when trying to use the remote. Very sensitive to your aim. Looks good and has handle slots to pick it up and a little notch on back to hang the remote
 I love sleeping with a fan, this one does great. It is quiet and I love the convenience of the remote to turn it on and change settings.
 Update 3/8/16...I've now had this fan for over 2 years and it still works great!!! No problems at all!<br/><br/>Original review - I read through the reviews &amp; did product comparison before I placed my order and I'm so glad I did! I definitely made the right choice...this fan is awesome! I really don't know what people are talking about...the fan is not loud. It makes a soft white-noise sound...to me it's what you expect from a fan. It is very powerful, it rotates, easy to assemble, has a remote control, has a timer, ion fresh air setting and adjustable air direction. I'm very happy with my purchase.
 I bought this fan for my unairconditioned apartment. Not only does it blow cold air, the ionizer removed any smoke or smoke smell from the room. It works incredibly well and across wide living room spaces. I'm living in an air conditioned apt now but still use it for clearing out the smell of smoke for my roommates. Love it!!
 Great fan for bigger rooms, adjustable air settings and ION setting is great. It’s solid and heavy enough it hasn’t been knocked over by my toddler, but light enough to move easily.
 This was the perfect gift for my husband, and it's not too loud for me. It's powerful, so even on my side I'm under more blankets than usual, but that means husband is super comfortable.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-RTH3ZJEMZ6W9N"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1CtBAFy8tS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91V+J3lPlNS.png"/> There is a bad HUM from the resistor or motor that is very unpleasant for sleeping (or doing just about anything else).  Additionally, my fan came with a CLICKING sound that comes and goes on its own at all speeds.  I made a sound-test VIDEO for you to see.<br/><br/>Overall there isn't much to save this product.  The buttons feel cheap and are also noisy.  In fact, even the remote buttons are NOISY.  It feels kind of unstable.  It seems like it will probably fall apart soon, so I can only look forward to replacing it.
 This fan makes a loud and annoying humming noise. My fridge doesn't sound this bad.  Unfortunately, the box it came in has been cut up so I guess I'm stuck with it.  I've had the Lasko #2554 in my bedroom for 2 years and I strongly recommend you go with that model.
 Ordered this model as a replacement for an identical model we had given to our son, and have been very pleased with after having used it for a few years with no problems.  Extremely happy with this new one - not an incredibly powerful air current even at the highest speed, but sufficient and very quiet, with easy to operate controls as well as a remote we rarely use.
 Best fan I have ever owned. It allows me to cut back on the AC in summer for big cost savings. The air circulation seems to cut the humidity in the air too, and actually feels cooler by several degrees. I plan to get another one for the upstairs too soon. Wishing for a Black Friday sale!
 I love this fan. We live in a small apartment in SoCal and it gets hot inside.  While the fan does not cool like an air conditioner, they do move the air in the unit and have greatly helped with the heat.  We bought a second fan just like this for our bedroom and we keep them going all the time.  On days when we do use the air conditioner, these fans help cool the unit off much faster and spread the cool air through the unit.  We have had them for about 4 or 5 months now and are very pleased with the purchase.  We would definitely buy them again.
 Wife loves it
 This was a godsend in the hot summer months in Southern California. The programmable shutoff is a pretty nifty feature, and the size of the product as a whole is very manageable in my small apartment. Assembly was a cinch, as well. If you're looking for a fan, this one does the trick!
 Looks nice. Good airflow. But contrary to some reviews posted here, it IS NOT "whisper quiet" as some people have said. Not even close. Makes a rather load, distinct humming noise. We wanted to run this fan at night while sleeping, but the humming noise is just too much. In the past we had a Bionaire tower fan that was much quieter. From all the positive reviews, I had high hopes for the Lasko, but it did not measure up.
 Nice very nice.  Keeps my husband and I cool in the house.  I have a fan now he has a fan.  I like the one I got him better but, I get air from it.  So it is fine.
 I loved it so much I bought three.  It's prefect if you have hot flashes.  The remote control makes it so easy to turn off and on from anywhere you or sitting or lying down.  I think its a great value.
 Doesn't really blow that much air, there's only 3 wind speed settings and it can barely keep a room cool. Disappointed but don't want to go through the effort of returning it.
 The fan works as advertised and puts out a sufficient amount of air flow for our use in a large bedroom. It is reasonably quiet in oscillating mode and on medium speed, where we run it most of the time. On high speed, it's a little louder as expected, but still, not so loud as to prevent us falling asleep. We haven't had it long enough to speak to its durability.
 Easy to put the stand on. I love the power and breeze it throws, perfect for any fan lover who needs the noise or cool breeze for sleep, especially with the remote and self timer.
 Been very happy with the fan. Like that it has a remote too. Been running it every night for many months now, no issues.
 First of all, we didn't expect it that big and tall for this price, when I open it,  it turns out to be a surprise! And it's powerful! If you use it for a cubicle in your office, it will blow you away! So it's better to use it in a living room or bedroom larger than around 160 square foot.<br/><br/>Second, it's very efficient. Because these days when we get home, it's like 100+ degree everywhere, but when we turn the fan on speed 3 and ion in no more than 5 min, me and my BF along with my cat will show up only in this fan coverage area (turning angle around 100 degree), it suddenly feels like 70+ degree. Just one word "Cooooooooool"!<br/><br/>Third, EZ to move.<br/>We just have to move it from living room to bedroom to washroom to cool with the air, so we move it frequently, and it's very light for me to carry it with just a hand.<br/><br/>Last, it has remote control and auto shut-off function, but we just like to turn it on all night long, so I didn't try that so far. Maybe it's good for kids.<br/><br/>Oh and one more thing, people saying it's noisy! What? You know what? I am a super light sleeper, I can wake up every night by my above neighbor's heavy walk (I'm thinking about sending them a snake after we move out @^@, I am just saying, though.), but back to this fan, it didn't wake me up, not once!<br/><br/>Overall, i love it and highly recommend for others!
 Amazing fan. Not many speed options but that's not needed. Fan blows ALOT of air and is quiet like white noise. Living in PHX, this is a must
 Purchased for use in a classroom.  Easy to use.  Light to carry.  Works!  Blows air on me.  As for durability, cant say, just got it.  Bought a second for home.
 This fan does a pretty decent job. I have it in my living room, pulling cool air from another room. Both my air conditioners went within a day of one another. So close to end of season, purchased one ac unit &amp; this fan. Definitely works well &amp; looks great!
 This fan is perfect!!! We use it in our archway heading from the living room to the den area to push the cool air from the AC into den because there are no ducts/ vents in that area. This fan does the job and does it well. It is quite and powerful. We love the look of it and how tall and slim it is. This fan is worth every penny and is close to $100 in the local stores. I am planning to buy another one for our bed room as we are so very pleased with everything about the fan. Great look, power and size!!! Buy it:-)
 We like the size, the wood tone and the quietness.  This was purchased to replace a similar tower fan that broke.  Seems efficient and durable.
 This is a excellent fan. I'm in a small office and the fan is very quiet, but powerful enough to keep me cool.
 We bought this fan for our studio apartment and it works great! The air conditioning in our complex is very week and ineffective so we thought this might help cool the apartment down. We have it on periodically throughout the day and night. I love the timer feature. This is not a quiet fan, but it’s not obnoxiously loud. It just sounds like a typical fan. We’ve had it for about a month and love it!
 Good Quality, nice and strong
 Love this fan so much. I bought it since my apartment does not have central air and the summers can make it really hot. I would keep this around the small wall unit I had and it would make a big difference . It circulated the air really well and it made it comfortable in my living room. I ended up buying another one for my brother and he loves it as well.
 Had this fan for about two weeks now, and it is working fairly well.<br/><br/>This fan comes with the features of oscillation (1 speed), 3 speed air flow, timer, and air ionizer. Lasko also includes a handy remote with this fan which is a nice touch, the remote uses 2 AAA batteries (the batteries are not included as part of the package).<br/><br/>The fan moves a good amount of air and does a great job at cooling down the room (while doing so with relative low noise). The air ionizer is a nice additional feature that can help improve your air quality at home. However, a note for users who are not familiar with the air ionizer feature, I highly recommend you to pair the ionizer function with a timer and use it when you are not home. At a high level, ionizer works by "charging" the air and making dust particiles heavier and falls to the ground instead of floating in the air (hence making the air cleaner to breath). However, the ionizer also produce a small amount of ozone, which is not good for your health. That is why you should run the ionizer with a timer away from home, giving it sufficient time for the tiny bit of ozone it generates to dissipates before you return (leaving fresh air behind).<br/><br/>The only downside to this tower fan is that the angle which the fan oscillate is somewhat limited, I will say only about 30~45 degrees. It wouldve been better if the fan is able to oscillate in 90 degrees angle to cover the entire room. But in my opinion this is not a deal breaker for me.
 No assembly required. 3 modes which I have found useful, and oscillates without issue. Slim design so it doesn't take up much space in bedroom.  Blue light when ion is on is quite annoying since I prefer to sleep in very dark room, but I put a piece of electrical tape over it and it is no longer an issue. At first, it produced a strange smell but has faded over time (not sure if ion capability is the cause). Makes a humming white noise, which is one of the reasons I purchased after reading reviews. Noise is even so it helps me to fall asleep. I have had this fan for 4 months now, and overall I am satisfied with purchase.
 My main factor when choosing a fan was noise, and I'm happy to say this one is very quite - if anything, the sound I heard is the rushing air, not the motors. I also love the fact you can choose if you want it oscillating or not, as well as the different speeds, and the remote is great for when you want to change something in the middle of the night but don't want to get out of bed. It's also really light, which is great when you are moving it around a room or just getting it in your front door. I would high recommend.
 Love this fan. Good power without being too loud (easily feel the breeze 10-15 feet away across our living room).  Small footprint means you can put it anywhere. Not heavy and we regularly move it between rooms. Remote control with storage cubby. And of course, great price for the features. The only thing I don't like about this fan is the blue LED light that comes on with the ion feature (pretty bright in a dark room), but that could easily be solved with a little sticker or piece of tape.
 Loud very loud
 This fan is one-word: AMAAAAAZING. Living in Florida where it's easily 80 degrees in February, not to mention the summers, this is the ONLY fan I've found that actually blows COLD air and not just circulate the hot air in the room. I love that it's also quiet unlike most fans. This was by far the best fan I could've gotten.
 The fan itself is good. Cools nicely. My complaint has to do when it oscillates. It was nice and quiet for about a week, but now it makes a lot of noise as it spins. I’ve given up on the spinning function and just leave it pointing in one direction. For the money, I expected more.
 Love this fan.  It's quiet and does a good job across my large living area.  It takes up very little space.
 We don't have central air in our home. I bought one of these last year because our upstairs bedroom gets pretty hot. It works great. It really circulates the air and keeps me comfortable at night. Well I'm pregnant this summer and it's hot downstairs too. So clearly I needed another one. It arrived today. Very happy with the price and quality.
 "Coolest" fan ever!  Quiet, strong, and it really does seem to cool more than a conventional floor fan.  I saved about $25.00 buying it on Amazon.
 Does not revolve/oscillate as much as I would like and even on setting "3" I do not think there is enough output. Have had others, half the price, that seemed better so I guess all I can say is that I am disappointed.<br/><br/>It is quite tall, more than I would like, but it is quiet. I would return it, but that seems like too much of a hassle. Too bad.
 This is a great fan, with excellent coverage and not too much noise. Our only complaint is that the remote has to be closer to the fan than where we usually sit when we're using it, and it has to be pointed exactly right. It's not a hardship to walk over to the thing to make adjustments, but assuming we paid extra for the remote control feature, we'd like to be able to use it more easily.
 I have to have a fan when sleeping and this fan is so quiet. I love this fan out of the last few I’ve had. And not to mention it’s a lot cheaper on amazon.
 These not only look beautiful but are really powerful too. Even when its 33 C outside they cool the room. We initially bought two and now buying one more.
 This fan should be great, and about 50% of the time it is. The other half however, one of the internal fans makes a clicking/rattling noise. The noise didn't start happening until 3 days after receiving it in the mail.  I'm not sure if it was from shipping, or just a defective piece, but one of the bearings is off. Now I have to figure out how to send back the fan, when I don't have the box.
 I've had mine a little over 4 months and it's managed to get me through summer without an AC in the bedroom. Recently the rattling has made it impossible to sleep, so I needed to squirt wd40 through the grates at the bottom, downward, towards the motor. Seems to have worked for now.
 I purchased it 3 years back .. it never gave me a prob.. only recently it stopped rotating .. but then the air quality is the same.. I live I. Arizona and I pulled off the entire summer without A/c in the nights atleast
 I'd purchased this fan in March 1212.  I've used it constantly in my bedroom as I need a fan blowing on me at night (even during Michigan's winters.)  About one year ago, the fan started clicking at the end of its oscillation cycle.  This was tolerable at first, but over the months the single clicking at the end of the cycle has become several snapping sounds during a single oscillation phase.  I finally had to remove the fan because of the noise. Just a heads up.
 Weak fan
 Absolutely love this fan. My main concerns when buying a tower fan is the amount of noise it makes and how effective the fan is. The fan is pretty quiet and I rarely had to turn it up to the 3rd level during the entire 3-4 months of summer. I haven't had any problems so far. It is very sturdy as well, i believe this fan will last for awhile.
 I've been using this  now almost more than 2 months, when first purchased it was very strong I could feel the air all the way, but now it getting real weak, barely can feel it; kinda disappointed :/
 Easy to assemble. Ion feature helps to clean the air and give off a clean scent. Fan options easy to operate. Remote device makes it more convenient.
 This is my second Lasko 2551 Wind Curve Platinum Tower Fan. The first one met it's fate in a tragic accident after years of use.  This is my favorite fan. It is quiet, cools well. I use mine most often to fan my laundry on an indoor drying rack. The ionic setting is my favorite feature. I notice when I use it regularly in my house it seems to keep the dust from circulating and cuts down on my allergies. This fan is worth every penny.
 This fan works great and has made a huge difference in keeping our bedroom cool. It would have been a 5 star review if not for the remote - which basically only works within about 12 inches of the fan. This renders the remote pretty much unusable, but we still really love the fan itself.
 We have a gas logs in our living room fireplace that throw off a lot of heat,  we needed to be able to circulate that hot air through the rest of the house.  Our white summer oscillating  fans did the trick but they were kind of an eyesore  in the middle of winter.  I purchased 2 of these tower fans and I'm very glad.  They are pretty unobtrusive (compared to the white fans) and they circulate air very well.  The timer and remote control are added conveniences that I'm sure we will use. There will be no need to put these fans in storage til next spring/summer. I will keep them out in my house throughout the year.
 I use this in my living room and it does a great job of cooling things down. It creates a very nice breeze and the remote comes in handy when it starts to get too cool. I purchased this after reading a review that it was quiet enough to not effect television watching and that is a true statement. I live in a beach area of San Diego, which is an area that you rarely see an air conditioner so fans are a must. Mostly everyone has their windows open this time of year and I don't want to be that noisy neighbor with their TV on too loud so having this fan, I'm able to bring it up full blast without having to adjust the volume. Good purchase!
 I purchased this because I did a search on "Lasko Space Heater" - when it popped up, I ordered it.  This is only a fan.  Frustrating......  thank you Amazon....  ugggg
 Fan works great so far!  The AC broke, so we decided to go the fan route instead and it really is great for our bedroom.
 I read several reviews of various fans before I decided I'd buy one of the Lasko's.  There weren't any of this model available in stores but I saw one in a shop I frequent and they allowed me to turn it on. It was great looking and it worked well. I ordered it online and I use it in my office. It's perfect since it rotates so air isn't blowing on one spot, it has three strengths of flow and, best of all, I can operate it remotely.  I like using it instead of a/c when the office needs cooling down but not cold.
 I am the type of guy who does not use a Air Conditioner.  In the summer in New Jersey it is very hot and humid.  I have this fan in my living room and this keeps my place temperate and comfortable.  In spite of my television, Blu Ray player or any other electronic device being turned on; this fan with the oscillating feature keeps the air flow perfect.  I have 3 fans, one in every room and an air purifier; the main reason I stay cool is the powerful Lasko fan.....I highly recommend
 I read so many mixed reviews on this. The main floor in my house gets so much warmer then the upper or basement. I do have AC so when it blows I do agree it is very cold air. However people were talking about it being super powerful. Yes it's strong but not going to blow you over. My favorite thing is how quiet it is! One thing I did not realize (should've looked at the specifications) is how big it is, definitely trying to make a statement on the room!
 Blows surprisesly cold air compared to our regular fans. We have really been able to turn the a.c. in the house way up since purchasing this fan. Being that air condition cost so much sure this will pay for itself in no time at all.
 This fan is much lower quality than it appears to be in pictures--you can tell it's very cheap plastic etc. It wobbles on the base a bit, and the first time I ordered the fan, it came with a broken power button (it was squashed into the fan). Amazon was good about exchanging the fan, but now I wish I had just asked for a return because I've had the fan for about a month now and the power of the fan is pretty disappointing (and I can't quantify this, but I feel like it's getting worse as time goes by). Overall it was a waste of money--- probably could have gotten something very similar (if not better!) from Costco for much less.
 First of all, I ordered this item late Sunday, technically Monday, and it arrived Tuesday morning. Gotta love Amazon Prime!<br/><br/>This fan is great! Easy assembly of the bottom stand, just 6 screws and that's it. It does not take up too much space which is great because my room is not too spacious. It is not loud at all, as stated by some reviewers And the blue light being "too bright" is an exaggeration.<br/><br/>A few things keeping me from a 5 star rating is, 1. I feel that the highest setting should be a bit stronger, but I can deal with it, and 2. AAA batteries are NOT included, which is inconvenient, I don't know many people who have those lying around, AA's yes, but not AAA's<br/><br/>Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it.
 Bought a second one!  Very reasonable.  Works great  on easing my allergies.  Best of all, these take the place of ceiling fans; no climbing up to clean them = no danger of accidents!
 I really like the power in the air it puts out an adjustable vents but the base could have been heavier making it more sturdy and durable
 This is a great fan. I've had the Platinum (with the faux wood on the front) for 2 years and it occasionally makes some noises like the tracks need to be greased when it's oscillating. I just bought the one with the silver face this year for another room. They come with an IR remote so we actually keep both remotes in the bedroom so we each have one on our own side of the bed. Very handy!
 This is my 3rd Lasko tower fan and this one by far is the least impressive. Very small rotation area and not quiet at all. Going to try another brand.
 This fan stopped working within 3 months, would not purchase at all. Does not produce much air and honestly there are so many things wrong with it. Just makes it hard to even want to write about.
 Absolutely the best fan in the entire Universe! Why? It's ultra quiet. It has a remote control. It is stylish. It has an Ion device. It has 3 speeds. It fits in a small space. It has a timer. I bought this one for my sister. She loves mine so much she wanted one. I have had mine for over 5 years and it still works like a charm!
 Who knew I could love a fan so much?  This fan is quieter than a box fan, but still emits a low white noise sound.  I keep this in the bedroom and have no problems sleeping.  It's amazing how cool it keeps the room!  We have a ceiling fan that is louder and does not cool the room half as much as this fan.  I highly recommend.
 I do love this fan, it does everything it is suppose to but it is way too loud . When the TV is on I have to turn up the volume . Wish I could find a fan that is not as loud . I read the reviews and some says it had a white noise sound , What the heck is a white noise ???? I thought it meant it wasn't as loud as most fans  but it is just as loud as all fans !!
 It IS quiet, but it just doesn't push as much air as the other reviews led me to believe. You have to be fairly close to the fan to even feel the air movement (within three feet on the low setting, within 5 feet on the highest) which means it doesn't do much good for a large room or multiple people unless you all want to cuddle in front of the fan. Would be okay for an office with a single person using it because it is indeed very quiet.
 This fans works VERY well and it’s oscillation reaches a pleasantly wide range. Very happy with it so far... I just pray it holds up. Only had it for a little over a month so can’t comment on that yet. Fingers crossed -
 This is an amazing fan! I see some people have complained about the noise, but let's face it no fan is 100% quiet. It is not loud at all, it's a lot quieter than an air conditioner. I ordered this fan because I have asthma and it cleans the air also my bedroom stays very hot since the sun sets on this side of the house. This fan makes it so much bearable when it is the hottest time of the day. I love it! I highly recommend this fan.
 Good fan for the price.  Works well and seems solidly built.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the oscillation range.  The range is very narrow compared to other fans I have had.  It oscilates maybe 30 degrees left to right.  Other than that it has plenty of power to push air and works much like a typical blade fan would as far as performance.
 This fan is awesome. It truly cools down a room. It blows cool air. My boyfriend and I LOOOOVE IT.
 This fan is good. Very strong wind - can feel all the way across the room. Couple of negatives though. It's got a small rotation axis - really just goes about 90 degrees.  I have another fan that does a full 180. This was super quiet at first but after a week, it started making a clicking noise.  Its noticeable but not so annoying that i would send it back. I have other tower fans that make much more noise than this one. Its also a handsome looking fan and fits nicely in the background in my living room.  all in all, it's a good fan for the price.
 Not only did the box appear to be previously opened; after opening and assembling the fan absolutely no air came through the vents.  I suggest products that are returned be thoroughly inspected prior to reselling.  Such a disappointing experience.
 Advantages: Quiet, Sturdy, easy to set up<br/>Disadvantages: The fan speed could be a little higher<br/><br/>Great fan. Bought this to replace an old box fan and it has not disappointed. It is quieter than the older fan with a similar ability to cool the room down. While not the highest wind output I have ever seen it certainly does the job. Very happy with my purchase
 It is much quieter than my old Seville. However, the base seems really fragile and is quite wobbly, when either just pushing the buttons or just nudging it. I'm satisfied with the amount of air it puts out, and it seems to put out cooler air than my old Seville.<br/>Assembly: I had a relatively easy time putting the base together. I laid it on my bed with the base part hanging over so that I could attach the base part by myself. Hope this helps! I will update as time goes on if anything bad happens...
 I really like this brand.  This is the second one that I have purchased.  The only thing that I don't like about it, is that when you turn it on, it's really quiet and if you're not looking at it and see the indicator light, you may not realize that it's on.  My other fan from Lasko, remembers it's oscillating setting, where-as this one does not.  You will need to turn on the oscillation each time.  It's just a minor annoyance.
 I get very hot at night.  This keeps me cool so I don’t wake up sweating.  My A/C is a wall unit so this really helps.
 I’ve only had this a short time but it is a powerful fan, taller than most and easy to assemble.
 Powerful and cool. Not like a regular fan. Feels as though it's cooling the air, which of course is impossible, but there you have it. Remote is very handy to select from 3 speeds, oscillate or lock in any direction, turn on and off.
 I bought this fan specifically to use after hurricane Irma to run off my generator. Talk about a great product! The oscillating fan produces really nice air flow and has 3 different speeds, not to mention it has a remote. When my AC finally came on at 3 AM it was 77 degrees in my townhouse. With this fan it felt like 75 (when you live in Florida you usually kept your air on 74 or 75). I would recooked this fan for anyone. It is not only quiet but the bandwidth of air flow is fantastic!
 This is the first tower fan I've had, and I am so glad that I bought it from my go-to place, amazon.com  Actually, I bought two of the Lasko Wind Curve fans. They both arrived very quickly with standard shipping. At first I thought the fan was too big, but it is just right. I put up the tortoise shell style up first. All I had to assemble was the base. I'm a senior citizen, and was glad I already had a Phillips head screw driver. I put the fan on the bed to assemble the base. That cradled the tower safely, and was easier on my back. I identified the two separate set of screws and went to work. It was HOT and MUGGY that evening! The fan fits in our living room nicely, and I really like the quietness of the fan and the easy-to-use controls on the fan and the remote. The three settings for strength of air flow are just fine. The area covered when the fan was oscillating is more than adequate. We had the two AAA batteries for the remote already and like the place in the back of the fan where we can store the remote and not lose track of it. I'm also glad about the ionizer to clear the air.<br/><br/>I gave the platinum Lasko Wind Curve fan to my daughter.
 This fan looks better in my house than it does in the photos.  The operation is simple and logical.  My previous tower fan required way too much button-pushing each time I started it up.  I eventually wore out the buttons on the timer.  That won't be a problem with this fan.  I runs relatively quiet, as tower fans go.
 The first one I bought was great. So much that I bought another. The second one makes a loud humming sound. I noticed the sound when I first got it, but it wasn’t noticeable ubless you had the other fan to compare. I was wrong to ignore it! It is so loud now that I cannot stand using it. Very disappointed.
 I really like this fan. It's bigger, quieter, and more powerful than I was expecting. We use it to help circulate the cool air from the air conditioning to the rest of the house, and it does this incredibly well. Assembly is minimal, and took about 5 minutes, including going downstairs to get a screwdriver. My only complaint is that the remote control looks and feels cheap.
 Couldn't live without this fan.  Use it every night and have for almost a year.  The remote control is a life saver in the middle of the night.  I have it set by my bed and turn it on and have instant comfort so I can go right back to sleep.  It is really quiet and puts out so much air!
 Bought this for our bedroom.  Did have a smell when I first turned it on and lasted a few hours.  Just opened the windows and it was find.  Chalking it up to new material smell.  Works great and perfect size for what we want to use it for.
 This is actually the second time we've owned this fan. The first time was in college, and it just didn't make it onto our small truck when we relocated cross country. (Our loss was our friend's gain.) Fast forward a few years and one hot kitchen later, and we knew just what we wanted to help keep it cool while cooking during the summer. The ionizer is great, and it really does leave the room smelling fresher.
 I bought the Lasko Wind Curve Fan several months ago to help cool off our bedroom during the hot summer months. It's been running continuous since we got it and has not slowed down. If you're looking for an osculating tower fan, look no further.
 This fan is quiet, powerful, and it looks great. The remote (which takes 2 AAA batteries, not included) is kinda cheap. You have to point it very accurately to make it work. But still, it beats getting up to change settings. The overall height is a little taller than I expected, but 42" is 42". It's my fault for not measuring. Also as other reviewers pointed out it ships in its original retail box, which is bright and colorful and screams "Take me!" if left on your porch too long. But I'm nitpicking, it really is a great fan.
 Works well, puts out plenty of air, and doesn't take up much space.  Puts out more air than the taller Lasko fan and the Honeywell fan.  I have 2 of these.
 This fan took about 10-15 min to put together. It's relatively quite and cools me off well at night. The oscillating feature is beneficial for when I want to put it in my living room. Overall great buy.
 Love it!!! I went back and forth about getting this item or the super pricey Dyson fan. I am so glad I purchased this fan and saved myself the guilt of buying an over priced fan. It blows a good amount of air and is fairly quiet. I sleep so much better with it so I had to leave a review. I definitely recommend this product!! No regrets!
 Buttons stopped working around 10-12 days of having it. Just been unplugging it because I'm unsure how I would box this thing back up to return it. Light is pretty bright LED so may need to tape over it if the ionizer is running. It will light up a dark room. Otherwise works fine and does the job.
 I never had a remote for a fan before, and I gotta tell ya, I love it. When you're hot and don't want to move one more time for any reason, being able to adjust the direction, the air flow strength, and turn on or off from my chair is just delightful. Believe me, after walking home from work on a hot, humid day, this fan is wonderful!
 This is a very nice fan. It is extremely quiet. It having an ionizer is jus an add plus. This fan moves a lot of air. I think I may buy another.
 Great power
 I love this fan!  It was easy to put together.  It's quiet and cool.  I haven't had to turn on the bedroom AC yet this New York summer, or even turn the fan on high, and I sleep so comfortably.  The only thing is, it seems a bit flimsy, but I could easily be wrong about that (in which case, five stars).
 I bought this item because of other reviews, and I am not dissapointed in any way.  It is great!  It moves a great deal of air, is very quiet, and and actually does seem to cool somewhat when the ionizer is turned on.  I thought those comments were crazy when I read them on prior reviews, but it seems to cool somewhat.  I will buy a second unit next year.  Have no negatives at all.  I do wish the oscillation feature had a wider angle, but I can live with it.  Great tower fan.
 I bought this fan to replace my current lasko tower fan which I have used without issues for about 2 years, until recently when the fans in it started squeaking. So I looked online for other options and after reading through countless reviews it seemed like this new fan was the next step up, and compared to other brands/models the best for my application!<br/><br/>I am actually writing this about 5 minutes after I just unboxed my new fan, admittedly extremely frustrated. The fan came in a brand new condition, however the package didn't include the screws or the key to lock the fan into the base. It's a bit ironic for me as my last fan I was in too much of a rush and just said forget it. But this time I was extremely careful with opening the package to ensure that I didn't lose my screws as the base is EXTREMELY cumbersome without the base screwed it. As my luck would have it, no hardware or screws that the manual is telling me it came with. Before I wrote this review I skimmed through more of the lower rated reviews and it seems like this is a common issue. It's so unfortunate as I may be just returning the fan to get a refund, since after reading around Lasko will only want me to send in the entire fan just because they forgot to put in the screws.
 A birthday gift for myself to help keep our theater room cool during the summer.<br/><br/>I bought this unit because it would run silently in our theater room and not distract us from our movies. It blows extremely strong but stays extremely quiet.<br/><br/>It has multiple speeds, moves a lot of air, has a remote control and has a small footprint. The exterior has a nice finish that looks more elegant than most. Blends well with our dark colored room.
 Bought it as a replacement of an older Lasko Model. This is slightly thinner in diameter. Seems to work well. Hopefull it lasts as long (10 years) as prior model owned.
 Just got this, love it.. quiet and much larger than I thought it would be.  Mine doesn't rattle at all, it has a nice handsome look to it.  Makes a nice white noise which drowns out outside noises and helps me sleep.  I'm happy with it.
 So far so good. The fan is very sturdy and puts out very good air flow. The noise is minimal as well. The remote is also very easy to use. MY one complaint--and it's a lame one--is that the blue "Ion" indicator light is too bright, such that it lights up my bedroom at night. It's nothing a piece of tape can't fix, however. I am pleased with this purchase.
 I loved this fan when I first got it. It cools well and is quiet. The perfect fan. I cleaned it all the time, but dust gets inside the filter. It's been a year or 2 and now the fan barely blows any air. I'm so disappointed. These fans don't last longer then a year or 2. I tried cleaning out the filter. There are a zillion screws in back and 2 are random star shapped (in different locations) so I am unable to remove to clean.
 This is without question the best fan we have ever had.  The power is fantastic and can fill a room at least 300 feet.  Rotation is just perfect and spreads the cooler air throughout the room.  It also has a built in ionizer which has helped us with the smell of our husky.  If you're looking for a standup system, you need to look no further.
 Powerful fan. Does a fantastic job. Love all the features and options. Almost wish it had one slower speed. I especially like the ION setting. Makes it cool and fresh.  Fan is a bit on the loud side at night. Doesn't bother me, but I am always worried it's gonna wake up my husband when I turn on the fan in the middle of the night. But overall, it's a super great fan. I am very glad I purchased it.
 Great fan! I've knocked it over 3 times and it still functions perfectly  ! Lol<br/>Definitely a great buy... highly recommended
 I was very disappointed when I got this fan put together. The fan does not generate a lot of cool air. I had switched from a round standing fan after it broke, hoping to save some space with this version but this fan does not make a dent! I am very sad that I had thrown away the box, because I would have returned the fan. The power is not high enough and the base has a very bright blue light on it that is very distracting if you are trying to sleep. Overall, very disappointed.
 Love this fan. It's elegant looking with the wood grain look and does a great job doing what it is suppose to do;  quietly.
 The fan came on time, I bought two, let me say that the aesthetics are really nice, especially the wooden looking area,,, very stylish. Really like the timer and remote feature, I give 4 stars because nothing was used to mask that it was a fan, it came just like that in the fan box, they just stuck my delivery  info on. "Not cool", anyone could have stolen the fan because it was very hot in Boston for a few days, luckily the nice UPS man has gotten so use to delivering  stuff for us, he waited
 Do not expect too much. A 19$ square lasko fan from Walmart is more superior in power output than this thing. I was a bit disappointed considering that this is 75$. This is used with a centralized AC or a strong portable AC. It is just like any other fan that circulates the hot air around your house.
 Nice looking fan. Stands pretty tall off the ground. Makes a bit more noise than I prefer. Remote control makes operating alot easier.
 I turned it on, yeah the airflow is pretty good. Used the ionizer for a few hours but i can't really tell a difference. The quality of the product is okay but feels a little cheap since the whole fan is made of plastic. Not bad for the price and minimum assembly required. I would buy again but maybe in a different color if available.. Its actually a pretty quiet fan but that doesn't really mean much to me.<br/><br/>Any questions about the product just ask I'll be happy to answer.
 I bought this for my mom as a temporary replacement for a broken ceiling fan. This fan holds up. Even though the base of the fan is cheap plastic that doesn't take away from the cooling and the quality of the fan. The features are also very nice, you can set a timer for the fan, rotate it, 3 speed options, it's great. Although it's a bit expensive it's definitely worth it.
 Quality product. I like the remote control feature. It is much less noisy than regular fans.
 Wow! This thing is awesome! I've never seen one before so when it was shipped to me, I thought it was huge lol. But it's very nice! It looks modern and not lame like the other fans, also I had to get it because I have two very curious toddlers (mostly my son, he will touch and grab anything!) so being safe is my top priority when it comes to these two. My children already tried putting their little fingers in there which I obviously got upset but nothing happened to their fingers! I'm so glad I'm able to keep the house cool with this fan and still being safe for my babies :)  And it has a remote! What?!! So cool. Lol
 I looooooooove this fan! I mean I freaking love it! This is one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. I've used it all year, through summer and winter. 1 star off only because it's difficult to clean and it can get really dusty, but other than that it's awesome.
 This fan has been the best!! I love the remote and especially the timer feature. Not being near the ceiling it blows out much cooler air than a ceiling fan. So glad I took a chance in a floor fan. I have now replaced my ceiling fan with a beautiful chandelier,  which I was hesitant to do as I require a fan to sleep.
 Very happy with this fan purchase! It's a little taller than I had expected-even though yes I did read it would be 40" tall-didn't pay attention I guess!<br/>Just so darn excited to have a nice looking fan that can sit back in a corner, unobtrusive and I'm pretty sure I won't trip over it like our old one w/the feet.
 Nice looking fan, but fan speeds are too low. It must be on high and directly facing me to do any good. It's pretty much worthless to circulate air in an entire room. I'd return it if I needed it for anything but sitting in my office directly facing at me.
 On high doesn't blow very hard. The weight is to high of the ground and they didn't make the base big enough making it tip prone. Just a little bump and falls over. The "handle" on the back that you use to move it is angled up with nothing to grip on. So when you have slick hands it falls out of your hand. Looks good. Poor engineering.
 We purchased this fan to place in a spot out of the way since it had a remote control with it, however the remote does not work and I never got return calls when contacting them about it
 Bought this as a gift; he spent a while playing with the remote. Love all of the added functions and appearance.
 This is perfect for purposes. Cools off the entire room. I needed air circulation in my living room and putting a ceiling fan is just not doable right now. So this serves its purpose. Three fan controls, and ionizer work for days at a time. No problems with this. I love it!
 I really feel being fooled by the reviews/rating here. Overall this is not a bad product, it probably deserve at least a 3 stars.<br/>However, it has very narrow oscillating angle, it is not quiet and it is not powerful. I bought two of them based on the high ratings, both of them behave the same.<br/>I really don't like being misled, that is the one star for.
 Unfortunately, I missed the date for returning.  I now have to live him a fan that is already threatening to stilt and fall.  It is now stable. The air output is unacceptable.  Not a good product.
 Wow, read a bunch of reviews for all manner of larger fans, and settled on this one... I am definitely not disappointed!  As strong as you want it to be, cools the room great, and the people who find it noisy are, well, I don't know what they're expectation is (are they comparing it to a $400 Dyson Air Blade thing or something?).  Anyways, it's quieter than most fans I've owned, even more expensive ones.  Super satisfied, thanks!
 Nice looking, sufficient air movement. Oscillating feature nice. However, after just 6 days the motor began to make a very loud growling noise. This happened on any speed. Totally unacceptable when I know of other people who have used their Lasko tower fans for years. Amazon was very nice about the exchange, even ordering a UPS pickup. Looking forward to the replacement coming in three days.
 This beast puts out a lot of air.  I'm using this fan in my bedroom and it's superbly quiet while I sleep (at the lowest speed).  The LED lights are a bit bright, but that's really my only complaint.  The remote is handy and works well with a pretty decent range.
 I bought the used one which was LIKE NEW condition and it actually was so I was happy with the products, however while installing the fan in my room and there was no screws to hold it from the bottom. I know, I am screwed up. It works well but it can't stand by itself. Hopefully you guys check out this message and help me out from this miserable situation. Thanks.
 I don’t like the fact of how bulky this van is but it gets the job done. Will be using this for camp in the summer.
 This is an awesome fan.  Quiet, cool, and energy efficient.
 Easy to put on base.  Works very well.  Three speeds and remote work and are easy to use.  Do not need to use remote.  Buttons also on fan.  Big and attractive.  Definitely a good deal.
 I love this brand ...I can't remember when we started ever getting Lasko, but I can remember the sadass fans we've had!!! Frankly, I can't wait to get this kind of fan- the vertical vs.  the box fan and see if I like it more; if I do , I would like to get another one for this sweet little ol' lady down the road, on a fixed income,so on and so forth!!! I'd like to see her be cool this hot summer,too!!!
 Our bedroom is the hottest in the whole house and we were dying in here before. This fan literally makes the room cooler and it’s much quieter than other fans
 This fan is FANtastic!! I love it! It circulated well, has a timer you can control it with a remote, there are feature I didn’t even realize it had
 I've had it now for a few months.. no problems with it. Easy to put together.. stl works fine!
 I had a previous model of the Lasko tower growing up at home. We had those fans for almost ten years - and they were still working when I moved out. I never considered buying another brand. Even the lowest setting on this fan cools me off more than the highest setting on an old Comfort Zone circular fan my roommate uses in the living room. The timer on this is also perfect for making sure it'll turn off around the time I wake up (which encourages me to actually get out of bed). It makes minimal noise and effectively cools my very stuff third-floor attic bedroom.<br/><br/>This fan is a great deal, works well, and, most importantly, I have confidence that it's going to last a long while.
 this is a great fan and for the people who say it doesn't give enough wind or air go in a wind tunnel. this fan give a lot of air and is great very quiet. did make a few noises but i guess thats normal<br/>because they went away. Also, the fan extremely helps cool down a room and it helps make it air smell cleaner. i love this fan. will update later if any thing changes, but i highly doubt that will happen!!!<br/>worth every dime compared to the other honeywell i had before this one that was the same size.
 Love this 42-inch Wind Curve Fan.  Good airflow without the noise of some of the other fans. My Mom has had one of these for years.  When I needed to replace my old fan, I knew exactly what I wanted.
 Like a summer breeze
 I needed a fan for my room for the summer as I did not want to run the AC all the time and this Lasko fan did the trick. The ionization works fine and the oscillation helps as well, the room is quite cool to the point where I am still using my winter quilt.  I did not hear any annoying sounds and the fan is very quiet, but I also live in a major city and sleep through fire trucks driving by.  The only negative is that the remote has to be pointed directly at the fan to work, but other than that this was an excellent purchase!
 This fan is okay but the price is steep considering you can buy a $30 fan that moves just as much air if not more. I wasnt impressed with the range of oscillation either. I think if you pay over $60 you should definitely get what you pay for. Not a horrible fan but definitely should be cheaper in my opinion.
 I've had it for about a month now and you don't realize how loud it is until you turn it off. Blows great. Ion feature is fake and a cheap selling point on their end, otherwise the fan itself is perfect.
 Fan works great but one of the buttons on the control panel was broken and pushed in completely rendering it not functional.  So surprised for a fan that seems so well made.
 Works well enough. I wish it were a bit more powerful but it gets the job done for now. I am using it in my basement to keep the boiler cool from the warm humid summer air.
 This is my 2nd fan. The last one I have had for 13 yrs+. Works perfectly. So happy. I'll be back. Thank you. Lilbit from California.
 Fan was easy to assemble. Unfortunately there is a pretty consistent rattling noise when I turn the fan on, no matter what speed I have it on. It’s fine for now to keep on for short periods of time, but I can’t sleep with it on due to the noise. Definitely disappointed.
 I absolutely LOVE this fan. I have had it for about a year and a half, now, and it still runs just as well as it did the day that I bought it. I had a tower fan before this one that used to fall over all of the time because it wasn't wide or sturdy enough. I don't have that problem with this fan. It is wide enough to make it very sturdy. Yet, it's small enough not to get in the way. The blue light on the front is barely noticeable. If I have one complaint, it would be that I wish it was a little more powerful because I tend to get really hot when I sleep. However, it's a very minor complaint because I keep it about 3 feet away from my bed and it does a good job of keeping me cool on most nights. Additionally, I love the remote control. I use it all of the time and it's so nice not to have to get up in the middle of the night to adjust the fan settings. I can honestly say that this is one of the best purchases that I've ever made.
 Had it just for a week and it does a big difference to my studio (just under 700 sq ft).<br/>Definitely a good purchase.<br/><br/>Would give 5-stars if the remote came with its own AAA batteries.
 I've had mixed feelings toward Lasko.  I bought a model of this fan about 3 years ago and it's still going strong, so when I wanted to buy a 2nd fan for another room, I knew where to turn.<br/><br/>So, I bought this model of fan a little less than 6 months ago back.  Since then the fan completely stopped working one day without cause or reason.<br/><br/>I wanted to give Lasko the benefit of the doubt that I just got one of their few defective fans, so I bought another one (3rd fan) about a month ago.  Since then, this 3rd fan randomly broke as well.  I'm not sure what has changed if their manufacturing quality since 3 years ago, but the quality of them has certainly worsened.<br/><br/>Just to clarify, Lasko does have warranties that cover these for up to one year. But honestly it gets to be kind of a hassle with shipping/repairing/receiving and the waiting period in between.  And to be frank, with the quality of their fans lately, I'm not even sure I want one of their replacements.  When functional, the fan is great.  But if you want a fan that will last, I do NOT recommend this one.
 This fan is taller than I thought it was going to be. That's good. Blowing strength is good. Base seems a bit flimsy, will update if it breaks. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because they didn't include the 2 AAA batteries for the remote.. I mean really? cmon...
 This is a good fan. It's probably not the best option for cooling down a larger room because it doesn't seem to have the best ability to push air, but it definitely works well for my small living room. It's very quiet and has a good amount of features. The build quality is decent.
 I had the same model in silver which works great. I purchased a second one and the high on it is slower than the low on the first one I purchased. Poor quality check or damaged in transportation? Disappointed.
 Great fan for general use around the house.  Remote control is very handy and stores in the fan housing when not needed.  It's quiet and powerful and the ionizing feature was a bonus as we didn't order this model.  Takes less floor space than a box fan and looks nice. The oscillating feature is better than expected and makes this fan quite nice.
 We really like this for our bedroom. Really quite. We ended up buying one for the guest room before we had company come.
 Arrived quickly, and is well-made.  Have lived with this unit for 6+ months and it works flawlessly. Will probably order another one for second room.  Highly recommended.
 Works quietly, looks good and I saw a noticable change in my allergic reaction once I had it in operation. Fully satisfied.
 Just received the woodgrain #2554...it is not the same item in the video...great fan..hence the 4 stars..however there is no hidden spot for remote.<br/>So,not a bad review...just an fyi review
 Does not take up the room that most desk fans do.  The swivel does not cover as much area  as I would like but it is well made and fairly quiet.  The remote is a nice feature.
 Fairly quiet with nightly use for some six months or so. I don’t use the remote, but it does work.
 Had 2 of these fans this my 3 rd lasco fans. Not as  quiet as I thought.
 The highest setting is like a medium wind breeze. Great quality item but we are about to move and I hope it doesnt break!
 The fan intermittently shuts off even when not using the timing feature. I also wish the air blew just a little bit further and the fam was slightly more powerful.
 This is a great fan. Blows cold and u can feel it from a distance in a large room! Easy set up to put the base together. Also very quiet, defenetly something I could fall asleep to. :) very happy!!!
 I had this fan for less than a year, only using it at night, and it started making noises and sounded like the motor was going out..  Very disappointed.
 Have had the fan for a over a year now and no issues so far.
 This fan is awesome! It runs quiet and disperses the air in a really great outward pattern. It no like any fan that I have had in the past, as I feel the coolness without the usual blast on me.
 Liked that it does not take up space and very quiet.  Dislike would like a higher speed and does not cool as good as one I had before
 Over the years, I've bought several Lasko fans. I haven't had any trouble with any of them. I would purchase this item again. The only thing I don't like is the new remote control design. Some of the buttons are stiff &amp; hard to push. I prefer the older version.
 The only room bedroom in the house without a ceiling fan is the master bedroom - go figure.  It's a high vaulted ceiling and would be a pain to get electrical after the fact in the attic.  This works just as well, maybe even better since it's not blowing air down on you.  It works well in a large room, really moving the air when it oscillates.  It's quiet as well, yet perfect for a little ambient noise for sleeping.
 Such a nice fan! Quiet, very tall, and the remote control is super handy. Love the wood grain look, makes it look like a nicer furnishing that blends in with home decor rather than a stand-out in your face fan..... would highly recommend!!!
 Good product. It arrived in a color I did not choose but it was not worth returning, as I was in need of a fan. It was easy to put together and the remote is small and works well (simple). I wish the air power was a little stonger only downfall. It is a quiet fan, which is great.
 I bought 2 Lasko 2551. Liked them so much bought 2 more so now have 4. Very quiet. I love the air purifier ion treatment at night. The timer allows me to sleep with windows open while air is being purified, then with timer, it automatically turns off from 30 minutes up to 4 hours. Great product and easy to assemble.
 This is our first  stand up fan and we love it!! It's not loud,  but not quiet either. Doesn't take up a lot of space, it does rotate and the timer on the fan is a huge plus! Well worth the price!
 Everything is really great except that blue light bulb..! Someone Probably forgot that people will use this fan at night in dark.. but otherthan that its worth every penny
 Love this fan I set it for four hour timer at night and it keeps me cool for a great nights sleep<br/> I don't Find it noisy and  combined with the ac on low  I think you can save money
 It’s a good fan, quiet and very good looking as well! Effective in summers. My room is pretty big and it manages to cool most of the part it’s pointed at. However, it is a fan and not a cooler, and does as much as a fan could.
 This fan is amazing!  It's a little bigger than I thought it would be but just like the other reviewers I swear it feels like this thing is blowing cold air.  I bought this to help keep the baby's room cool because it's on the second floor and in the corner of the house that gets the most sun.  This worked perfectly and despite it's slightly large size it really doesn't take up very much room.  I like the fact that it has a remote and the nice features like the pivot, timer (you can set it in 30 minute increments all the way up to 8 hours.  Best investment ever!!!
 Love this fan!  Have to have the fan on all night because I get really hot when I sleep.  This fan is quiet, and blows strong, cold air.  It comes with a remote control which is really handy.  It also has the option to rotate, as well as an ionized air feature.  Highly recommended.  Sturdy, cost efficient, and quiet!
 Very good fan!!  Love this blowing on me when I sleep at night. Our house had a direct hit from lightening, and the fan quit working.  I cut off and replaced the plug - turns out there is a fuse in the there that got fried. At least it saved the fan!
 a light on the front lights up the room and I need to sleep in the dark so this is a fail in this area. It is noisey so for those who need noise in the room this does work on this front. But the light kills me.
 Excellent product but delivery problems with items being deposited in the wrong address repeatedly. I will buy it again because my customers love it and still want it. However the shipping process needs some serious work.
 We have central air in our home but this year our air conditioning tech suggested that we put a few fans around the house as a way to keep the cool air flowing. So I went to Amazon searched fans and gave this one a go because of all the positive reviews. I'm  glad I did. The fan is all that folks claimed it to be and more, we love it. I will be getting two more. It is very quiet and the timer is a big plus.
 Amazing Easy to put together and perfect for my bedroom :) Arrived perfect box was fine and not smashed 10/10 Would buy agian
 helps circulate the cool air in my living room and takes up little space.  It's quiet
 Air flow is pretty low. It helps it be extremely quiet but would like high to blow harder. Would have bought a blower type fan if I knew it was this little air flow.
 I bought two of these fans within a week of each other when I moved into a rental house without ceiling fans. They both do their job well when they're working correctly. Within two weeks of purchase one of the fans began making a really loud grinding sound. I've found that if I turn the fan down to level 1 the sound stops... However, this is a big problem if you want to use the fan at night when you sleep - the grinding sound is loud enough to wake you up.
 This has been absolutely great. Fairly quiet. We have AC but it's nice to feel the breeze. Also, cools you when it's those in between times, not cold enough for heat, and not hot enough to turn on the AC. Would buy again.
 I was expecting this to be pretty quiet, but the fan is fairly strong even when it's on its lowest setting, so it's pretty loud. My roommate has a Lasko but a different model and its lowest setting is quieter and works very well for him.<br/><br/>Just wish it was quieter.<br/><br/>not sure if t he ionization does anything, room still dusty. Gave it 3 stars because I can find a normal upright fan for the same price that's quieter.
 Still using it almost everyday in my bedroom. It's lasted almost 3 years.<br/><br/>3 speeds, has rotating mode, and the ion thing.<br/><br/>Edit: it's now march 2017, and I still have this running every night..<br/><br/>Edit2: June 2018 and still runs nightly to counter the Hawaii heat<br/><br/>Nov 2018: Still going
 The fan is very quiet even on its highest setting. It moves air somewhat good, but it definitely needs more power. My old fan with the same height and width use to move a lot more air on every setting, but it was much louder.
 Haven't used it much yet, but so far I really like it.  I got it to replace a ceiling fan.  I love how quiet it is and that it takes up so little space
 At first I thought this was an awesome fan!  However, it doesn't quite blow as strong as I would like though it is still pretty good.  Second it was very quiet in the beginning.  Now it is making a humming sound which is quite evident.  Barely acceptable but it was better when it was just the rush of air that you could hear.  May try to get it replaced!
 So I’m assuming the wood panel fan has an ionizer but the silver ones do not-even though in their details advertise it and show pictures of the feature. Otherwise ok fan, but I was disappointed.
 excellent design<br/>repeat customer
 I really like it. Haven't tried cleaning it yet, but does its job and is dead quiet. Silver goes well with its frame --it's not Dyson but doesn't look cheap. Has all the necessary functions. Remote controller works well although it needs to be pointed at the fan's head where the main control is located.
 I have been using a box-style fan from Lasko for years. Switching to this fan has been amazing! It takes up very little space and is relatively quiet. It puts out a 'white noise' more than anything. Great to fall asleep to. The ION feature is great! I use it in a medium sized bedroom and it's great to purify the air. The remote is a great bonus. I can change the fan speed and put on a timer, all from the courtesy of my bed. The only downside for this fan is that using the ION feature at night turns on a rather bright blue light. Probably not the best for lighter sleepers. It tends to light up the room. Nothing a little black electrical tape can't fix. Great fan overall! Looking to possibly pick up a second for my living room!
 This was perfect for my tiny office/small group teaching area. This fan seemed to condition the air that isn't typically the best in a space with little vetilation, while taking very little space.
 I love this fan the ionizer is great, this fan makes far less noise than regular fans. I bought it for my son he sleeps with ionizer on &amp; sleeps so much better now than before.
 I would not have made it through the summer without this fan.
 Love this fan.  I read all the reviews before purchasing it and am totally pleased.  It's pretty tall so it covers a nice large area.  And in our Carolina Summers it's nice to have a little extra cooling power.
 I've had this fan for 4 years.  The first 2 summers I used it, I loved it.  Then last summer, the remote quit working, even though I replaced the batteries.  Then this year, it became incredibly noisy while oscillating.  I used WD-40  on the base, which worked for a while, but then no matter what I did, it was horribly loud and would keep me awake at night.  So now I leave it blowing constantly in one position to alleviate the noise.  Now the latest problem with it is that it sometimes doesn't want to turn on anymore after I've turned it off for several hours.  Sometimes I have to unplug it and then plug it back in to get it to turn on, or if it has power but the fan isn't blowing, I'll have to put it on the highest fan speed to get it to turn on, then lower it to the lowest speed, which is the one I like best.  So now I am looking for a replacement fan and am not finding anything on Amazon within my price range that has acceptable reviews.  Bummer.
 It arrived in an overnight shipment and still the box was pretty badly damaged and had been taped around the middle to hold it together.  So, I was careful to save all the shipping material in case it had broken and I had to send it back.  But voila!  It works perfectly.  It moves lots of air.  The ionizing feature is silent; and on low speed, it's very quiet.  It's taller than I expected.  I should have measured.  But if it's tucked into a corner, it will be fine.
 Great quiet fan.... but this dude is BIG.<br/>We have several of these throughout the house and this is the grand daddy for sure.
 This is a good fan, it works well, the swing is good, the noise is bearable: I am a very light sleeper, and can't sleep when the fan is on high, but low is quiet enough. The ion is great. All in all, it's a great deal.<br/><br/>The reason for 4 stars is that it has a high center of gravity. That makes it difficult/tricky to reach out from the bed and move it a little. I usually keep it about 3 feet from my knees, blowing air over me. And I am sometimes a little picky about the direction of the air flow, and tend to minutely adjust the direction of the flow by leaning out of my bed (I'm just too lazy to put a foot down and reach for the top of the fan), and grabbing the grey part below the vents to slightly adjust the angle of the fan. In the days immediately after I got it, I almost caused the fan to topple a decent number of times, that I am now conditioned to anticipate a fall.<br/>And it gets too noisy on speed 3.
 Out of blues, fan stopped working. Wish I could have bought something similar in Costco where I could return. Now I’m struck with this junk ready to dispose
 We love our fan. It's space saving and quiet. The air is soft rather than a harsh blow like our traditional fan. The only complaint we have is that the range of the oscillator could be more.
 It works well. It is quieter than my previous tower fan. I cannot tell exactly yet what the Ion Purifier does for the room. But, the fan part works well.
 It’s not quiet at all. The fan became loose after a month of use, and now it sounds like I’m using an air conditioning unit in the window!!!
 Keeps the entire master bedroom cool and fresh- I love the ionizer because the air quality seems like natural outdoors rather than pushing air around.<br/>The low setting is ideal for nights and during hot summer days the high setting will save lives!
 A replacement of another tower Lasko fan. I do find that this one  has less features than the last one, but does the trick. I like the Ion feature because it helps cut down on dust in and old apartment with no hood fan for the stove.
 I've only been using this fan a few days now but so far so good! Looks great (exactly as in the picture). It was easy for me to assemble by myself. It's easy to use and the different fan speeds are perfect; #3 blows strong when your room is hot! The remote is definitely worth the extra money. It's not as quiet as I wanted but it's not a bother.
 Looks great and is cold....almost too cold for a small space.  I use it in a bedroom with no other cooling sources (on its lowest speed) and often wake up to turn it off.  It only has 3 speeds so it doesn't have the the flexibility of other fans, but if you're looking for cooling power, this is a good choice.
 I have a Lasko hybrid fan and I needed another so I got this one.Its working fine;very quiet like my other one,but my only problem is that,it's very top heavy which I think makes it wobbly. The base is on correctly and the screws are tight but it's still wobbly,other than that it's fine. (Can't say I've noticed any difference in the air using the Ion button.)P.S.  The wooden like finish is a plus.
 This fan is amazing. We now have three of them for different rooms. It’s very sturdy and works really well. It’s pretty quiet too.
 I love this fan.  It's so much quieter than the one we replaced, and it works much better too.  We'll definitely be getting more!
 Cools close as you can to a real air conditioner. Lots of settings to choose from. Wee love it.
 Very quiet &amp; easy to assemble! I love the ion option. Would buy this fan again.
 Seems like these are getting harder to find...  I like the style.  It's big, but seems sturdy and pretty streamlined.  Not noisy.  Has good range of adjustments in speed, good range in oscillation.  I'm very happy with it so far.  Comfortable for an average-sized room.
 Update 2 years Oct 2018!! So I have had this fan running everyday for 2 years and it still works amazingly and makes no noise other then the sound of air coming through.<br/>I have a small room with no ac and this keeps my room nice and fresh love this product.
 I wish I would have bought something louder but now I’m stuck with it. It does a good job and will freeze you out of a room. But it’s too quiet!
 This is the second such fan I bought. The first was fantastic - quiet, and moved air around the room effectively. This one has been problematic from the beginning. First, it emitted strange fumes (smelled like a car exhaust) when it was first turned on. Now it has developed an annoying rattle that seems to be getting worse. I will be returning this unit.
 great fan, taller than expected but I could've used the measurements before I purchased so that's no fault on them. Not sure if the Ionizer does anything but it makes me feel better. The only flaw for me is how bright the blue ionizer light is. No problem a little electrical tape can't fix though!
 This fan is nice and quite but also powerful! The remote also works well. I am glad to have this fan in my room.
 very powerful and noiseless, very good overall except the buttons.  Giving 3 start because one of the button went inside when i pressed it and never came out. See the attached pic.
 The fan has started making a terrible loud noise after just three months of use, rendering it unusable.  Very disappointed in this product.  I guess after three months it's probably not possible for a replacement or a return, and I don't see a place to contact the seller.
 Looks and works great, and it's quiet.
 Blows air around the room like a champ. I have no idea if the ION feature is cleaning the air or not, but I turn is on anyway :)  The remote is great for the  folks that don't like to walk across the room or the folks that are snug in the bed and don't want to get up.
 I have no air conditioning in the back half of my apartment. I live in rural Tennessee. My ceiling fan no longer works. If it was not for this thing I would never get any sleep. I love it so much. I really really hope it doesn't quit on me before winter gets here.
 The little lights that go on when you turn on each feature are too bright. The Ion blue light is practically a nightlight and I had to tape something over it. Otherwise quite happy.
 This is a great fan. It provides just enough noise to block out little sounds throughout the house, but it's very smooth to where it doesn't add a lot of noise. Easy to clean; easy to use. I will buy another one soon.
 Wow! This is a powerful, gorgeous fan.  It really cools down my home office.  I'm going to order another, for my guest bedroom.
 does a great job blowing air and not falling down, would recommend
 This fan works well and is much quieter than the older Lasko I have in my other office. The remote works well and this model doesn't beep every time you hit a button on the remote. I prefer it not beeping when you use the remote.
 This a a BEAUTY!!! Wow!! Can I give it 10 stars?? Best tower fan ever.  I coukdnt find this brandy anywhere else but here. Blows so powerfully yet perfect white noise not overwhelming like my Holmes one.
 This fan is perfect for the master bedroom.  So glad I purchased it.  Easy to move around.  Comes with remote.
 On the 2nd day of operation an intermittent rattle developed under the controls.  Generally a poor quality product that I would not recommend.  Ion feature of dubious value.
 Looks great easy to assemble... but it doesn't produce a power of air unless you're standing in front of it.  Would have made a different choice if I knew that before i purchased it. Price was good.
 Love this fan. Puts out a great amount of air and quite, but not too quite to where there's no background noise while I am sleeping
 So far still working. Usually my fans bite the dust (literally and figuratively) after 3 months.
 Moves a lot of air. Using this as a second fan for an older, similar model Lasko tower fan. This one is a little more compact, but moves way more air! I took off a star only because this fan tends to operate a little louder than our old fan, albeit moving more air. The quality of the buttons seem a little cheaper on this current model though. I still highly recommend this fan.
 fantastic tower fan, our friends have since bought 2 and love them as well.
 We bought this fan to help cool off our dining room and our family room at night. Although it's very cool at night where we live, we keep our windows closed to keep the noise down so we need a fan to keep the rooms cool. It's a great fan to keep an individual room cool and avoid using your central air. So far it has served it's purpose very well. Hopefully it will continue to run like it has. It is a great value for the money. If we can get a full year of use for the fan it will be well worth the price.
 I like the air comes from this fan, very elegant and suitable for bedroom, living room, no noise, and the height is good for those who sit in front of the TV. or computers. highly recommended
 Good fan, quiet. Stable stand. Only problem is the remote has to be pointed “directly” at the fan, a little bit off and it doesn’t work. Fan does Not make any annoying beeping sounds but the click when using the remote is a little obvious in a quiet bedroom if someone else is sleeping.
 Great fans. Move a decent amount of air and run quietly. The remote is very handy as well.
 Doesn't blow as strongly as I expected. It is fairly quite but gives just enough of the white noise I like.
 after owning this fan for four years we decided to order another one. BIG MISTAKE. We've gone threw two of these in a month. both returned because of a rattle. we ordered a Honeywell.
 This fan just missed it by a star for the loudness. It does it duty as far as cooling us off but the fan noise can be a bother. It's in our living room so it basically would compete with our tv for the noise. We found ourselves turning the fan off at times just to get rid of that "annoying background noise"
 Blows super cool. It doesn't just blow room temperature air. It actually blows cool  air.
 This fan stopped working after about 4 months. It completely shut off, then upon trying to turn it on it made my extension cord catch on fire. Tried to return it and the company warranty was no help.
 I've had this fan for a month and so far it has been just what I was looking for: a silent fan that blows cool, ionized air.  Even on the high setting, the fan is pretty much silent... this is a massive upgrade over my old box fan.
 We bought this fan 6 mos ago.  We loved it, until it abruptly quit working.  For no apparent reason.  We were actually getting ready to buy another one for our bedroom.  We won't be buying a second.
 This fan works really well. Keeps me cool and I especially like the timed turn off function which is great for when I go to sleep. It does have a fairly audible click when it reaches the extent of its rotational travel and this could be annoying to some users. I can get over it, but I always fixate on it for the first few min after I turn on the motion feature.
 Item arrived dead on arrival. Would not turn on, despite perfect assembly (it's actually very easy to assemble). Checked multiple outlets and did everything I could, but it just doesn't work. It's a shame, as the product is beautiful. Now let's see if their customer service is any good...
 I bought one a couple years ago and still going. Got another one and the new one works very well. They are quiet and a nice flow of air.
 Less than 10 minutes after running the fan it began making a terrible screeching noise. Seeing as I use fans for the white noise to help with Tinnitus, this is obviously a problem...
 Works great in bedroom (18' X 15' room)! We recently took down our ceiling light &amp; fan and replaced it with a single light, so this was bought to take the fan's place. I actually sleep better and more comfortably having this. It's quiet and has a strong fan (3 speed settings).
 This fan is not real noisy, it is a fan so it will make noise. When pressing the buttons, the fan wobbles a bit but not to point where you feel like it is going to tip.  If i was to change something, it would be to make the front grill removable for easy cleaning.  Overall, i am really liking this fan.
 Bought this for my teenage daughters room (we live in Texas) and it works great! Remote comes in handy for her and she loves the various settings. Doesn't make a lot of noise and was slightly taller than I expected but very happy with it.
 We love these fans.  They are quiet and they you have options of it turning, 3 levels of air and it has an ionizer (sp?) we have three of these
 I use this every night in my bedroom. It seems to keep my room fresher than without it. I sleep well and cool most of the time. Quiet enough that does not bother me for sleeping. My sister use to say my room had a mans smell to it. What ever that means. She hasn't been back since I've used it, but I think it is much better. The only fault I have with it, I didn't get the screws that fasten the base. They weren't in the package.
 Very low power. If you set fan to low you don't feel it but you hear the motor rev
 Very cool and feels like it lowers the temperature of the room overall unlike most conventional fans. It was pretty easy to setup, I haven't used the remote control that it comes with but for those who don't want to change the settings by getting up, you have the remote option. It is pretty lightweight and you can easily move it to another room if you need.
 crucial to my routine. i found myself in need of a fan when i was in my apartment complex about a year ago and now i cant sleep without it. this product can be noisy, but in a white noise kind of way that drowns out other sounds. one of the best purchases i have made.
 LOVE this fan! not only is it really nice looking but i love that it also cleanses the air when you use it! it has a really nice timer too especially if you don't want it on all the time. its also nice that it comes with a remote for us lazy people who get cold fast! highly recommend this fan!!
 I bought this fan to cool off my bedroom, and this fan does a good job. The circulate option is nice when I want to cool off the whole room rather than just me, and the ionizer seems to do a fine job of making the room smell fresh. However, the maximum speed of the fan does not quite seem fast enough to cool off my entire room. I wish it was slightly faster to really circulate some air. However, it works well enough for me.
 Quality is good, Lasko is reputable. Disappointed with discounted purchase. Item indicated it had damaged packaging. Packaging was fine, the FAN was damaged and very used. Someone pulled a bait and switch.
 It really does feel like an A/C like others indicated in other reviews. Using right now and about to turn it off because I'm getting cooled.
 Fan is not "quiet" as my husband would prefer (which would be complete silence) but it puts out a LOT of air even on the lowest setting.<br/>Remote works decently, I don't particularly use it.<br/>Placed a tape over the ion light--it is too bright for the position I have the fan in beside my bed.
 The fan works great, but the remote that came with it does not work at all.  I ordered this for my elderly father who lives in another town and had it shipped directly to him.  Now I have to figure out how to get a replacement remote control for it.
 I've had this fan for about a month now and I've got no complaints. As other reviewers mention, it's LARGE and on the highest speed it makes its presence known. I don't mind. In tandem with my windown a/c unit, this fan quickly cools my large apartment living room + kitchen. I'm super happy with this fan and would recommend it.
 DO NOT BUY.  Left the fan running over night and through the next workday and when I got home, it was dead.  It will not power on at all.  I threw the box away thinking it would last longer than a couple weeks so now I can’t return it.
 Love this brand had a space heater for over 10 years and it finally gave out<br/> So I bought another space heater. I like this fan because it quiet and I like a timer that I can set for half an hour. Keeps my room very comfortable
 Not sure about other people's experiences, but be careful if buying this fan used. My fan did not come with a remote or ANY of the screws needed to mount it to the base. Not only that, but all of a sudden today the oscillating motor just broke for no reason. It seems a lot of people really like this fan (as I did) but maybe I just got a dud.
 Works great in the warmer weather when the AC in not really needed, or when it is so hot the AC could use a boost.
 Adds comfort and moves a/c evenly around the room.<br/>saves electricity.
 I got two of these, and I was quite pleased the remote for one didn't trigger the other fan. Lots of bells and whistles. Easy to put together. Jury is still out on longevity, but I am pleased at this point. 8/16
 Fan is nice and quiet, and blows a lot of air.  Even on the lowest setting, it's too much for me while I'm sleeping, so I keep it facing away from the bed to just move the air around the room without blowing directly on me, and it's perfect.  In my larger rooms, it really makes a big difference and helps reduce my need for air conditioning.  I know the description says 42", but I was still surprised by how big it is.
 This fan has been one of the best purchases I have made. It works so well and controls the environment in my room so well. I like all of the extra bits on it. It makes using the product that much better. I cannot speak about how well the ION button works. I understand the science behind it but I  am not sure if it means anything outside it providing a placebo effect. Product is still excellent. Much better than any other standing blade fan product out there available right now.
 I love Lasko products, over the years we've purchased many fans and heaters and have had no problems but THIS one stinks. We've had this fan in our living room for less than a month and a few days ago it developed a terrible rattle. The fan works great but we can't use it because of the TERRIBLE rattling. Less than a month of use Lasko... what the heck?
 It still functional after a month, easy to piece together, love remote control, not much noise (but can be used a white noise)<br/>small able to hide in corner,
 We own two of these, one works fine, this second one we just received is louder.  Packaging was really destroyed upon arrival as well.  Not as happy with this one, will not order another one through Amazon
 Decent fan. The blue light as others have said is really annoying when you have the ion setting on. It's not super powerful. If you're looking for a van to cool a room, I'd recommend one of the Vornados instead.
 I was devastated when my little sister came to visit and accidentally broke my fan in the middle of the hottest month ever. However, I am thankful now because I purchased this baby! It comes with a remote, the wire to plug it in is discreet and doesn't make the fan tip at all. It's easy to put together and is super powerful! I don't think it's that noisy but the cold air is SO worth it.
 I love this fan.  It looks so much nicer than a typical stand fan and works even better.  You can "hide" it in a corner and it just blends in with the decor.  It's quiet, too!
 The fan works well. It’s nice to have 3 speeds and oscillating option to move more air around the room. Works well and it’s not too loud.
 This thing is durable, I have full on grabbed it by the base and smashed a door with it only to wake up and it was still blowing fresh ionized air on my body
 Great item!!!
 Fan works great. Incredibly quiet, even on the highest setting. I set this on high with the oscillating function and it cools the room down in minutes. Love the Ionizer function. Not sure if it's just the placebo effect but it actually seems to take care of smells. Overall, I needed a fan for the upcoming summer and am glad I went with this one. Makes my whole living room cool and didn't cost an arm and a leg.
 Have had this a few months now and it works great!
 I really like this fan, it comes with a remote and is really quiet (I use it in my office). I wish the remote was a little more sensitive, I feel like I have to push the button really hard to use it. Otherwise it's a great product.
 Very quiet but i dont recommend it for someone with asthma or other respiratory issues as the ion setting aggrivated my asthma a lot
 really does push the air.  Had a smaller one broke.  Didn't realize this additional height on the new one would make sure a difference in my living rooom.  Have not had to turn speed up past 1.
 Looks great.  Doesn't blow much at all. If I post in right in front of me its sufficient for cooling but then it's much too loud up close in your space
 I bought four of these because I needed it for a big room.  All four boxes seem worn out, kind of like the boxes you would expect from a returned item.<br/><br/>Some Points:<br/>-It is relatively quiet<br/>-The assembly is simple<br/>-The fan air temperature is not very good.  Some of the fans I've seen in department stores were A/C quality air, but I'm not sure if it's because the environment was cool or if the fan itself let out cool air.<br/>-2 out of the 4 fans had a weird motor sound, which was pretty bothersome in comparison to the other 2 fans.  It didn't affect the performance.<br/><br/>In the end, this fan is under $60, and I think that's what you get.  Most fans seem like they're in the $80-100 price range, so I'm guessing there is quite a difference in those fans in comparison to this fan.  In the end, the only reason why this fan doesn't get 4 or 5 stars is because the fan didn't let out cool air that's refreshing on a hot weather.
 I used to have an standard oscillating fan for many years in the bedroom.  When it finally broke down I decided to give a tower fan a try.  This fan puts out a great flow of cool air.  It is a little loud, but I love the white noise.  I can't sleep without it.  This is so far the best fan I have ever purchased.  Very satisfied.
 Not too loud but not as quiet as some reviews made it out to be.. Great look. Light. Does it's job. Happy with it
 Love this fan and the ionizer feature. Can't sleep without it
 Fan works exactly as described.  Very easy to assemble and operate.  Tower is stable and safe.<br/>Does put out cool air and cools down room, and timer is very nice feature.  My 1st Lasko product<br/>and I want to buy couple more.  Site Casa.com(Quidsi Retail) was excellent; received less than<br/>24 hrs.after purchase.
 Not as quiet as I had anticipated, but an awesome fan (we don't mind a little background noise) - we love that it turns and has different levels, and I adore the remote aspect, as I am loathe to get out of bed to turn off the fan when it gets too cold.
 Received this and most of the fan blades inside were in pieces.  As soon as I unpacked the fan from the box, I heard rattling and the pieces just fell out, too many to count.  Big gap in the bottom of the blades inside the fan.  Box was also slightly damaged, don't know if that caused the breakage but either way, the fan seemed to be really cheaply made.  Bought a replacement but not from Lasko.
 I've used this for half a year now and it still works great. It helps keep our living room cool with little noticeable noise. The tower tends to wobble quite easily when touching the buttons, so I just use the handy remote instead and the wobble concern is fixed. So far very happy with this product.
 Power could be stronger, and the ion light is much too bright to sleep with, but other than that happy with it, have been using it every day the whole summer, doesn't take a lot of space and is not too loud.
 I read a lot of this reviews before buying one for myself, and I can tell you its the real deal, the looks, the ionizer works, the remote also does and the speed of the fan its average, if you want a fast fan then you should look up elsewhere. Its great for a normal size room and its also quiet.<br/><br/>The ion led light its quite bright and I had to put a black tape on top. So it works for me.
 Doing the job.  I am not crazy about fans but  I don't want to run my central A/C all night just to cool the bedroom.<br/>Because of it's height it reaches the bed perfectly.  Has 3 speeds, oscillates, timer.  All with remote control which is<br/>convenient.  It is relatively quiet, which allows me to fall asleep w/o problem
 Can't believe the difference it makes in new theater room.  Thought I would need 2, but 1 does the trick perfectly.
 I just recieved this and immediately assembled it. When i bought this i read the reviews first and it were all nice... now im regretting my decision. First the tower is wobbly when attached to the base, when its on oscillation it just reaches a 90 degree turn, and lastly the speed is just as fast as an ordinary stand fan which i already have. I thought this would be better.
 Hardly any air blows from this fan on top speed. Which is super disappointing considering how large it is.
 I Purchased the fan for my living room, and it works like a charm. Really helps complement the AC.  I can see an improvement in my Electric bill.
 This thing is life changing. I bought it for my dorm because A/C wasnt allowed and it gets hot in there. This thing is like having an A/C on, it has that option that keeps the air fresh and eliminates dust and it has a remote. I love it.
 Fan is okay.  I was looking for something fairly quiet for sleeping.  Motor is quiet but the base is cheap and flimsy and rattles all night.  I would not recommend if you are looking for a good night sleep.  I have had this fan for 3 weeks and have already purchased something different.
 So pleased with the Lasko 2551 Tower Fan.  It is everything they said it would be, and more.  It's very quiet, but the only problem I have found is the ION.  I do not smell the sweet smell it is said to have.  Doesn't really matter to me, but I was a little disappointed in that.  Otherwise, Hooray!
 This fan is terrible I have it inches away from my bed an I still cant feel it. So disappointed. But don't feel like all the hassle to take it down and send it back
 It's okay but not purchasing this make again.
 After owning this fan for over a year I realized all my sinus issues were coming from all the dust built up inside and around the filter that I could not get to to clean out. One night without the fan and I already few much better!
 This fan was a gift for my husband, it replaced another fan, he loves this one and told me<br/>it is quieter and superior to the previous fan he had!
 Not sure if the ionizer is doing much, but the fan works as intended and does a great job of circulating air.
 Did not work properly out of box called manufacturers customer service WAS INFORMED TO RETURN TO MANUFACTURER AT MY EXPENSE how's that for customer service
 Very nice for an office or very small bedroom. However, if you want more air for a larger room i definitely advise getting one of their hybrid towers. Powerful and really does the job in a large room. Unlike other reviewers I do not find it noisy, and I have it standing approximately 4 feet from my television.
 Terrific fan, great price. I especially like the remote since it's on the other side of my desk. The motor is trying and quiet and the fan does everything you'd want it to do-- oscillates, cools, has variable speeds.
 This fan is quite nice and provides a good amount of cooling in my office. It is quite easy to put together, but requires a screwdriver. The only negative thing about this fan is that all three fan speeds are quite similar and too powerful unless my office is a bit hot already.
 Love it - quiet<br/>Takes up very little space<br/>Light &amp; easy to move around
 I bought this for my husband and I thought he'd love the remote the best. Nope. He loves the button you can press that's good for 30 minutes of fan time, so if he presses it a few times before we go to sleep he will get 1.5 hours of fan and it will autmatically turn off. He LOVES it. Makes me happy to give him something so useful!
 bought two of these last summer when our town was sold out.  the "new" climate we are experiencing in Hawaii is crazy hot and humid during the summer months....these fans were a godsend, especially the town was sold out in a few weeks...
 Love this fan!! I'm a hot sleeper and this thing is my lifesaver. Oscillates just enough and also has the option to stay still. The remote is more than convenient when laying in bed at night. I'm thinking about buying another one for my son's room. I would definitely recommend this fan.
 Love this fan and its quiet.  I leave it on all day for my dog who is home since the AC running can get expensive.  The room is always cool for him.  I ended up ordering another one for the family room since it can get muggy in there in the summer months.  Works well there too. I would buy more if I needed them :) Also very stylish and durable.
 Accurate description. Works well. I'm happy. Wife has stolen it once to put in her room. Guess I need a 2nd one. Fan, Not Wife, One Is Enough. :-)
 This holds up amazingly in California heat. I find even the lowest setting cold and I love the time feature. Would definitely buy again.
 It looks very nice in our living room.<br/>We really enjoy it.
 Works like a charm. Moves a lot of air with a good with a not too heavy breeze. It makes my air conditioner more efficient, and can set it a bit warmer and still be comfortable. Also takes up less floor space than the stand fan it replaced. more expensive than the floor fan, but much better. I would recommend to anyone. The remote is also useful, I can stay in my chair and control it in another room.
 We have used this product in our apartment for a few months now, and couldn't be happier. The choice of three speeds and the rotating ability has made our purchase worthwhile.
 Love this fan. I used it all summer ALL THE TIME and it is still going strong !!
 I'm glad I found this "platinum" version instead of buying the black with brown/wood front.  I was a little disappointed with the limited range of motion on the oscillating feature, as well as the limited up &amp; down range of the top portion controls.  I was expecting it to be like a car, where you can close it completely up or down.  It barely makes a difference with it's limited range of motion, but the unit is tall enough that it doesn't matter. As for the side to side oscillation, I have it placed in the corner of the room &amp; it is actually the perfect amount of swinging range to not blow the blinds all over the place or go too far in either direction that it bumps the wall like those other tall pole fans.  I'm extremely satisfied after day one. The fan is so quiet even when on it's highest mode that it makes our round desk top fan sound like a jet!  I did my research &amp; this fan was not disappointing.
 This fan is so quiet and looks really great, you won't be disappointed.  Also comes with remote, can't beat it.  This replaced another fan I had that I bought here on amazon that was really loud.  This one is whisper quiet, even on high.
 Could not live without it. I love mine. Even took it to the hospital.
 It’s a good product! I haven’t really used it much because it’s winter time but we live full time in an RV and this is such a space saver!
 Very happy with this fan.  It's very quiet and love the ionizer feature.
 Quiet, efficient.  A bit high up so that the dogs can't lay down and get the breeze, but otherwise it's fine.  The timer setting is a nice touch so it doesn't have to be tended to.
 Fan is functioning as expected. The best thing about it is that it is quiet, does not take much space and matches the furniture and the wood floor it is standing on.
 Fan is very quiet and works fine however a bit disappointed that it wasn't as powerful as I thought it would be.  You need to place it within five feet to really feel the wind.  It is, however, beautiful in appearance, more so than any other fan I've seen.  A very attractive addition to any room.
 I purchased the item for my mom for the hot florida weather and it now just blowing out dirt at her. It was fine but now its not working very well. It only lasted about a few months after purchase. I purchased it in May and it started its troubles in August 2017.
 Love it! Sure any fan could be quieter, but it is not very loud at all. Can barely tell it is running when the tv is on. Moves a nice amount of air on high setting, which is what I was most concerned about. I have had these tower types before and they always disappointed. Not this fan! I am very happy with it!!
 Pretty quiet.  Powerful enough, I would say.  I would give it 4 stars except for the fact that the 4 screws needed to attach the fan to its base were MISSING.  I'd still be disconcerted if not for the fact that I was able to use the ones that had been part of the fan which I was replacing, which finally broke after several years of very satisfactory use.  So.  Three stars of 4.  Take your pick.  Cheers.
 Only lasted 6mo. &amp; came with a different plug that was reattached! BEAUTIFUL,  QUIET,  A LOT OF FRESH AIR! TOO BAD IT DIDN'T LAST! &amp; MUST HAVE ALREADY BEEN RETURNED ONCE! I THOUGHT I WAS BUYING A NEW PRODUCT! NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM!
 Received the fan in the original packaging all beat up and makes horrible noises. Plus it was left out on the porch for anyone to drive by and steal it.
 Love this.  I’m very satisfied with my purchase.  Now I don’t have to turn the AC on at night.  The ionizer feature works really well also!
 It works great for keeping cool in the summer weather in the south. I have not noticed a significant difference with the air filter. The fan is able to cover a good portion of the room.
 This fan is a nice fan for a living room.<br/><br/>Pros:  3 levels of air movement, high moves a very nice amount of air, oscillating movement, looks great<br/><br/>Cons:  After 4 hours of running, during oscillation, at the end of each movement, there's an annoying sound of like the fan is hitting a stop, it's not very loud though it can be heard easily if it is quiet, only reason I'm removing 1 star<br/><br/>Note:  I purchased this product on my own with no manufacturer discount.
 Pretty powerful fan, good rotational coverage, and the ion filtering function sounds cool
 This fans works well and don't know what I would do without the remote.  I can change setting gs from my bed.  Easy to assemble.  Liked it so much I bought TWO
 The oscillate function started getting rather noisy within an hour, maybe two of having oscillate on. I would expect better lubrication than that. Otherwise this fan seems fine, although I am unable to locate the ionizer components inside (looking though the grills).
 Very pleased with this purchase. It's quiet, 3 speeds, oscillating, w/ air ionizer, timer, with remote control. Easy to assemble base, worth the money. Hope it saves on my electric bill.
 My sister had one of these fans at her house so I decided to buy one.  This is the best fan I have ever used.  I think it's the vertical fan that makes this one so great.  It's pretty quiet and the remote control is great.  I love being able to control from anywhere in the room...and not just the speed, but whether it oscillates or not.  The quality is great for the price.  We are very happy with this fan.
 It's been wickedly hot here in San Diego the past 3 weeks. Needed an affordable fan, yet one that actually cools. Read the reviews on this fan and decided to give it a try. Must say, EXCELLENT. Feels like an ocean breeze. Super happy with this purchase and it was within my price range. I also like the fact that i can easily pick it up and it doesn't take much room
 perfect in the corner of our room to help circulate the air (we have a long room)
 Nice fan with good output and decently quiet as well.
 Hate it! I have it less than 18" from my body all night, yet I sweated all night! I am in the northeast coastal area!!
 Bigger but less powerful than my wonderful little SoleusAir, which is no longer available. I like the fan fine, but it came without the screws and hardware to secure the base to the fan. I've contacted Amazon but have gotten no response. Until I get the hardware, the fan gets 3 stars.
 Can't live without this... Enough said.
 Love my fan. Super quiet. Had trouble putting base on, had to rely on my daughter to put it together, I guess I have no strength.  I would definitely recommend this product.
 Okay, I've bought a total of 4 of these now and that says a lot. We have one in every room, they work great, look nice. Thank you
 I like smooth large volume circulation with low fan noise, The cylindrical fan throws a wide flow of air and the optional side-to-side oscillation covers a room from the corner.  I find with heavy use, I get three to four years before the motor bearing seizes up or something else wears out, so that's a good value. The remote is handy to have at hand. I have two running on low in my workshop and find them very reliable.
 I love this fan! My room gets very hot and stuffy compared to the rest of my house. During the summer months I always have my ceiling fan and another tower fan on high when I sleep. With this fan I was able to turn off my ceiling fan and just use this. The air did seem cold coming out while I had the Fresh air on. The lights on the indicators are a little on the bright side but I go to sleep with my TV on so it doesnt bother me.
 I bought two of these fans two summers ago. The first summer was fine, the second summertime fans no longer oscillated, and I plugged them in today- to find one does not work at all anymore, and one only work by plugging in and only has one setting now.  Terrible value for as expensive as they were.
 Easy to assemble. Good fan. Puts out decent amount of air. I'm not in the artic like I'd hope for but it definitely supplements on hot days!
 The fan works GREAT. I purchased this after reading reviews that it was nearly silent… Not the case. After three or four days of using it through the night only, it has begun to make an unbearable roaring/humming  sound. I am sensitive to obnoxious sounds and a light sleeper so it’s not working out for me.
 I bought this fan because I wanted a fan that was powerful like a normal floor fan but space-efficient like a tower fan.  I've gone through my share of weak tower fans.  This fan is the best!  It pushes air way stronger than any tower fan I've ever had!  The bottom line with tower fans is, you get what you pay for.  If you want a strong tower fan you have to spend the money!  This is definitely a great buy!
 I love this Lasko fan, I even purchased one for my mom and grand mother!<br/>It has 3 quiet speeds: Low, Medium and High.<br/>with an automatic shut off timer, to help save on energy.<br/>My mom uses hers in the kitchen, during the Summer when its very hot and humid,<br/>she really likes the fresh air ionizer feature.<br/>my grand mother uses her fan in her bedroom during the Summer,<br/>She likes the remote control feature and the quietness of this fan.<br/>the front wooden panel makes this fan look like a high end piece of furniture.
 This fan is amazing! It has reduced our use of the AC immensely. It is powerful enough to cool a large room without the annoyance of a noisy fan. I would recommend this fan to anyone looking for a sleek fan that is effective, quiet, and well priced!
 Great for hot summer days when the AC doesn't quite get it done.  :-)
 Fan did not stand perfectly upright, tilted towards the floor slightly. Also wasn’t nearly as quiet as I expected it to be. I returned it...
 Ordered two. One works fine the 2nd fan makes humming sound produced from the motor at even the lowest speed. Cant return since the seller denied return request (30 day return policy). The product has 1 year warranty. Not sure who will replace it Lasko or Seller?
 I love this fan! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because there is not "built in" way to clean this unit besides a can of air and some hope.
 This fan is the quietest,  best fan I have ever purchased! I don't know how it does it, but it blows cool air! This fan has actually lowered my electric bill and I live in a high humidity area in south Jersey. And I bought 2! Excellent buy!
 Pushes a tremendous amount of air without being super loud or bulky. The remote is nice but you have to aim it directly at the fan without anything in the way, and it's still a little finicky even then. I've used the Ionized air filtration but don't notice a big difference. The cord is nice and long which lets me set it up wherever I need it. Not sure when I'd use a timer function, I guess it's nice to know I have it though. Has extra control at the top to point the wind out of my face, great for when I'm on my computer and don't want my eyes drying out constantly.
 WOW, You can feel the fan across the room!!!! I am glad it has a remote :D
 This is the 4th summer and it still performs like the day I bought it while looking sharp. I have 2 of these and both are going strong.
 Wow! Worth every penny. Stopped using my central AC since I got this.
 It is easy to operate and arrived safely.  Easy to put together.  However, it does not heat that well and takes quite a while to do so.  Also, you can't direct the air flow.  My lower legs and feet get cold and that is where I prefer to send the warm air.  I wouldn't have purchased it if I had known.
 I had high hopes for this fan.  Everything is ok except the power.  Even at high it is not very strong you have to sit very close to it to feel the air.
 I bought this fan because my room is near the kitchen, so it gets really hot. I needed a quiet fan with a remote. The Lasko fit the bill. I absolutely love this fan. I was surprised when I saw the built-in ionizer. It was a great addition to a great fan. I'm completely happy with my purchase.
 Loves this fan - it really is efficient and helps cut down on a/c bills. Quiet, oscillates - has 3 air speeds.<br/>Great quality.
 I bought a fan from one of my local stores, and I had to return it since you can't hardly feel the air. I went thru the reviews before purchasing it, and I have to agree with almost all of them. The air is cool and a lot. kinda an AC. Great product, highly recommended.
 Received the Lasko 2551 Fan last Friday. It did a great job it's quiet and gives air so far for the kind of weather right now. Gave 4 star because of deep scratch found on the top front area (see photos) the rest is ok.
 As advertised. I like it very much.
 It's just a tall rotating fan. Nothing out of the ordinary. You can also just plop the body on the stand and it will rotate on its own, so you don't really need the screws which is nice. Its difficult to imagine my life before having this.<br/>Best part is the built in timer !
 stands pretty tall. The wind speed is not an issue. I use the air ionizer but really can't tell any difference in air quality. This ONLY circulates air, does not cool the air. Degree of rotation is also enough. I like the led lights that show the status of the fan.
 We have several  Lasko fans. This one is a little disapointing. The fan on the highest speed does not put out as much air as our previous fans. Still a good fan, but I would recomment it for a smaller area than what I was hoping to cover: a large living room.
 It's a good fan, but it didn't come with all the parts - the screws to attach the tower fan part to the base were missing. I've just been using it without them (but have to be careful of running into it since it's not very stable), but eventually I'll have to go to the hardware store and try to buy some. Also, one of the LED lights is pretty bright for use while sleeping, but I just put a bit of tape over it and now it's fine.
 I love this fan! I needed to replace an old tower fan that broke at the base and this fan has been a WONDERFUL replacement. I've now had the fan for a few months and I haven't had any issues with it. I don't know what all the madness is about the light being too bright... it's a tiny dot and it isn't an issue at all. It's pretty quiet and the air-flow is excellent. I LOVE the timer feature. So happy with this purchase!
 Works great and very good for the price on Amazon. Cheaper than I found in stores. We have 3 of this same fan in our apartment and they all work great! Love that it has a remote too so I can turn it off if I'm laying on the couch or in bed.
 Fits nicely in a corner.  Stationary or swivel.
 Works well, I like the tower because you can cool from floor to ceiling at the same time. My dog is very happy about that also.  The remote is a wonderful thing to have, especially for us old folks.  Also it has helped to cut down on our Air Conditioner use.
 Perfect fan for small places!
 It's quiet but pretty weak. Not a lot of air moved even at max. It's a good amount of air considering how quiet it is though. It also looks pretty nice.
 Quiet,greatly cools off a room.Very much appreciate the timer function!
 I absolutely Love this fan. I can never go again without one of these bad boys.
 Provides good air flow
 I really like this Dan. Nice look to it. Love the remote. Nice features
 Assembly was easy. Turned on the power and it roared to life with a bit of a bounce and sounded like lawn mower blades hitting a metal sprinkler head.  Turned it off. Disassembled the stand and put it all back in the box.  So disappointed that I got a lemon.
 very nice fan. It is quiet and powerful, I really like it!
 Keeps my cellar sweet!
 LOVE! I put it in my 3rd floor bedroom, which is very hot in the summer. The constant and easily controllable breeze is god send. I feel like a little kid with the remote! If I want to move it, done. Turn it up or down, done. Put it on a timer, done. Turn on the ionizer, done. Turn it off and on, done....ALL with the remote. If you are a fan of fans, you will LOVE this fan.
 This product is great for a freshman dorm room. It drops the temperature enough to feel like air conditioning. But, if you have trouble sleeping with lights in the room, you’ll need some electrical tape to cover the LED indicator lights.
 Excellent fan. Quiet, blows a large amount of cool air, even on the lowest setting. Good for even large rooms on the high setting. The bright light is a little annoying with the ION breeze on, but a small piece of electrical tape takes care of the issue. It is a little light for its height, so keep kids away from pulling on it, as it can topple over.
 I love it, feels like a breeze blowing on you! It’s convenient, looks good and lightweight to carry. I would recommend to others and purchase another if needed.
 I have a Honeywell Quiet Cool w/ 8 settings that my family loves because it has multiple settings &amp; it's quiet. I needed another tower fan for house. We don't like to sleep in A/C.  I went w/ this Lasko because of the good reviews, we have several Lasko heaters that still work after 5 yrs &amp; the wood look is stylish. I truly REGRET this purchase! It's oscillation range sucks. At first, it worked fine. Now, after 3 weeks, it sounds like a 1980s remote control plane coming in for a landing. It's loud on all 3 settings. My husband, who can sleep thru a tornado, told me to, "get that loud thing out of the bedroom." It has the power, cools just fine, looks great, but LOUD!!! Update: Amazon said today was deadline to return it; I did just that.
 If it weren't for the annoying blue light on the Ionizer feature, I would have given this 5 stars.  The fan part is very quiet, the ionizer is  louder, but I sometimes like to have both on when I am sleeping.  I have to cover up the blue light because it is so bright.  I just keep thinking of a space ship trying to beam me up.  Maybe mute this light when you make more of this fan.
 The box was damaged, actually, it was missing all 4 of the bottom flaps, only secured by clear tape.... It is super weak, barely blows out any air.
 My 3rd one...my favorite fan ever. Cant beat price.
 Only had it for a week, so far so good. Relatively quiet
 Quiet and powerful, this has a smaller footprint than an old-fashioned stand-up fan.  I'ts extremely quiet, perfect to keep me and my computer cooled down.
 One great fan, covers a large area. I use this in our family room about 400 sq ft in size and it makes a difference in cooling it down on warm days. Sometimes when it's really hot we will use the main a/c along with the Lasko tower fan to cool it even faster. Would buy this again for sure.
 Bought my 4th one of these recently. They are great, and we've put them all over the house. And quiet! I am a light sleeper, but I've been able to snooze away with one of these just a few feet from me. The remote and timer are excellent features, too.
 Great fan! Had one I bought maybe 10 years ago, and exact same one - finally conked out on me. This one is better and an improvement.<br/><br/>Pretty quiet while pushing good amount of air. Great fan and blood value. Build is solid and it's powerful enough to cool a bedroom or living roomroom.
 Pros: Fan is well put together and fairly low noise (except on the highest setting).<br/>Cons:<br/>Bright lights on front panel - needs covering-up if using at night<br/>Stopped working almost exactly 12 Months after purchase, so not durable for the money
 Arrived on schedule, and packed safely. Put unit together, and fired it up. I have to say it is louder on all speeds than what I replaced, and rotation seems to be less also. But use it everyday here in Las Vegas, and am pretty content.
 It uses negative icons. Feels cooler than a fan and has sought of white noise helps with sleep.  This is the second one that I bought because you can't beat the quality for the price.  It's the best fan I have ever used
 I love this fan! It's loud enough to provide light background noise, but quiet enough to easily be forgotten about. It also provides a great airflow. Would definitely buy again!
 Not happy with this purchase...  Looks nice but barely blows air...  On high, you barely feel the breeze...
 42 inches is really beeeeeeeg! I should really read more carefully. This fan is huge but still it is quiet. Love the remote. easy to put together. just watch where the cord is feeding when putting the stand on...Thank you Lasko!
 Quiet,powerful fan!I was vacationing at a friends condo in the mountains and personally always have to have a fan to sleep.This model was in the bedroom.After using it a week,I ordered before I even made it home.LOVE it!!The remote is easy,Very powerful and quiet!
 worst purchase ever! A paper hand fan delivers more air than this Lasko towers fan. Bad quality fan and looks pretty cheap. The rotation has a close angle. It is noisy and the air ionizer makes no difference at all. 3 Fan speeds all of them horrible. I hate it. None of the features are true. Even the remote control is not as they show on the video. There is not comparment to save it. Total waste of money.
 Motor is loud.  Three quiet settings only make it less loud but I can still hear the motor three rooms over with the doors open.  Also the box was a mess when I got it.  I don't know if it was shipped that way or if damage was done during but based on the old dried out tape on the box I would guess I got an old one.
 Kept me cool and froze my husband during my last trimester.
 Keeps place cool when I sleep
 Purchased to supplement my old wall-AC unit and this does the trick! It's big - but that was expected due to the specs. This fan is great for cooling down the living room in my 1 bedroom apartment. And for $50 - it's great to keep costs a bit lower during the summer months
 Remote is kinda flakey, but it the tower works as promised.
 This fan is very quiet, attractive, easy to move, and has 3 setting for fan strength. You also can have it oscillate or remain stationary. We're very happy with it.
 I AM IN HEAVEN!!! I use this fan in my bedroom because no matter what I have done to try to keep it cool, it just isn't. I put this fan in my bedroom and now I don't want to leave! I sleep so much more soundly because of the comfort level of coolness. The remote is priceless; no getting out of bed to adjust the speed, power, or oscillation, just push those buttons on the remote and continue sleeping. THANK YOU LASKO!!!!!
 I have a smaller bedroom and this fan keeps it cooled down. As other reviews have mentioned, the blue light that turns on when you enable the ionizer feature is a little bright and some may find it hard to sleep with it on.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a great purchase and I would highly recommend this fan for use in a small room.
 Love this fan, great power and the air actually feels conditioned and not dry!!!
 Great product - just what we needed.
 This is a very weak fan, at full speed (#3) I barely feel any breeze. I wish I could return these. Honestly beware!!!<br/><br/>Bought two of these because they are best sellers and there are lots of positive reviews (last time I go by that).
 Easy assembly. Works great. Quiet. Price was reasonable. Fast shipping.
 Powerful yet takes up little space!
 These are AWESOME! I have them in several rooms in the house and they are FANTASTIC!!
 I was looking for a fan for our 13' x 17' dedicated Home Theater room and this one fit the bill perfectly.  Of paramount importance was finding a fan that would move enough air without disturbing the audio.  While not exactly "whisper quiet", Lasko's low speed provides a lot of air and doesn't interfere with the soundtrack.<br/><br/>The unit looks good tucked away in the corner, has a small fully functional remote, and was reasonably priced at less that $60.
 Works great! I have never had a fan with a remote....and it's pretty awesome :) I bought two and the remotes are interchangeable. The fan isn't as strong as my cheap box fan, but it's more quiet and oscillating...and doesn't stick out like a sore thumb from my decor.
 Quiet...works as expected.
 I should have bought one a long time ago! I have to sleep with covers on, and so my room is best with cool fresh air.  This fan MAKES cold air somehow, doesn't just blow hot air around. I'm also a light sleeper and the fan is nearly silent--just the right amount of soothing white noise.  No rattles or other annoying sounds.<br/>I love the remote control, and the timer has almost infinite settings.  I'm buying another one for my SO and maybe another for my dining room. I'm patting myself on the back for making this purchase.
 The fan is great. It's quiet and effective. But it arrived without the screws to attach the base. I find that this happens more and more with Amazon purchases - just something small that isn't as it should be. Frustrating. I wish I had bought it at Home Depot, instead.<br/><br/>Also, if you want to use the ion feature, it has a really bright blue light that comes on. I didn't think anything of it, but I use the fan in my bedroom. The light is just fine in the daylight, but this silly little blue light has woken me up several times in the middle of the night. And I'm usually a deep sleeper. It's easy enough to fix, just turn the ion feature off. But it's worth noting.
 I purchased the unit for my condo porch (9x9), Not much room and I can't hang one from ceiling.  It works well but for one announce, It's makes more noise than I like. On the lowest setting, it is tolerable, but ever present.
 It feels like I have an extra air conditioner. It's quiet but powerful, and looks nice in the living room.
 These are really great fans especially if you are limited on space. My son gave me one that he no longer needed. I liked it so much that I purchased  two. The one my son gave me is over seven years old and works great hopefully these two will last as long.
 Overall we like the fan very much.  Just wish it were a little more stable.
 quality electrical components, solid and sturdy, easy to assemble,  fan is surprisingly strong while  significantly quieter  than most other fans i have used in my life.  I have a sense this a product that is going to have a long useful life
 We liked this fan so much that we ended up buying a second one! Summers in the PNW with no AC can be miserable. This fan helped quite a bit. I'm knocking it one star because the base seems a little flimsy. Over time, it has become loose and the fan "creaks" when it rotation mode. Other than that, all good.
 Fan is great. Is is not silent, but by no means loud. 3 speeds, good range of oscillation, convienient remote. Would buy again
 Smelled like burning electronics and died within a short time.
 I have finally found the fan that makes all the difference. Not noisy, great air flow, remote control. Aesthetically attractive.  Third tower fan I have purchased, and how many fan cousins of various shapes, sizes....etc, but finally the fan that makes hot days and nights much better. Does not require the tv to be turned up loud in order to hear it over the noise other fans have necessitated.
 This is exactly what I have been looking for.  Surely hope it lasts for a long time.  The set up is easy and it goes right to work.  It is quiet and doesn't blow you over.  The remote is great to have.  I haven't had it very long so I don't know about the "fresh air" feature. The people who received one from me love it too.
 I bought 2 fans. One 8 months ago and another 6 months ago. I would have given them 5 stars until now. Within the last month now one fan will not oscillate at all and the other will not stop oscillating and makes a clicking noise. So in a short time I now have two broken fans.
 I've had this fan since September and it works great. The multiple speed settings are convenient and the remote reception works at a number of distances and angles. Would definitely recommend and buy again if needed. It's slim and quiet. I love the ability to set an amount of time for it to turn off so I can go to sleep in a cool room but not wake up to the fan blowing.
 Really nice fan.  I was surprised at how tall it is even though I read dimensions before buying.  I can easily raise AC thermostat here in Florida at least 2 degrees and still comfortable.  Very quiet with soothing sound and I am picky about that.  I will buy another.  Highly recommend this fan,
 The fan had a few scratches on it from the factory. Also, the intensity in which the air flows out of the fan is different than the fan I purchased earlier in the summer. The air does not flow out as strong as my other fan. I should have sent it back but I didn’t use the fan right away and a month had passed before I used it and that’s when I noticed the difference in air flow intensity.
 This fan blows cool air.
 Looks nice. Moves quite a bit of air. It is noisy, however. As noisy as a desktop fan. I use it in my office.
 I really like this fan! I have tinnitus, so white noise (for whatever reason) helps me sleep. The only thing that works better for me is a good noise-reducing headset (but who wants to fall asleep wearing headphones?). My last fan was also a Lasko, but this one is "way mo better". Works great on low for me, but on High it slings some serious air!<br/>Was (for me) worth every penny.
 Nice look and not space consuming.  It would have received 5 stars, but for the output being not huge and the swivel not widespread.  It covers about 45 degrees of space, or less.  It has 5 star noise reduction compared to other fans.
 This is a good fan in a lot of ways.  It's stable, it's very nice looking, and it moves a lot of air.  I am using it in my bedroom, so I don't need to move a huge amount of air, so I only use it on the lowest setting.  I could see if you're using it in a large room or an office where you would use the higher settings.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's not really quiet.  It says that it has "quiet settings", but even the lowest setting is loud in my opinion.  It's not so loud that I can hear it in the next room, but not quiet enough that I can sleep with the fan running.
 While I use it since a really need a fan or even two. It is noisy.
 I love the design of the fan and it is quiet. The one issue I have is the fan speeds low, med and high basically have no difference between them.
 It arrived and did not work. I tried calling Lasko to see if they knew why. Terrible service. On hold for 15 minutes and no one answered the call. Do not buy this piece of junk.
 I bought this after doing lot of research and I don't regret it. I don't know how, but it blows cooler air. Not as AC, but compared to regular table fan it is cooler. I don't see much difference for ION button. It has self timer for unto 7 1/2 hrs. The remote is real handy. The oscillation does not rotate as much as other table fans. Apart from that I have no complains.
 The fan is great, has a nice output and multiple settings. Biggest downfall is the awful is the HORRIBLE click noise it makes when rotating. When it hits the end of a turn, you hear an annoying thump, which is incredibly distracting. Was great before that though
 Bought this cooling fan for my wife to use in the room where she uses her bike trainer and she really loves the fan. The functionally and quality<br/>are first rate. Will buy this fan again if the need arises.
 Perfect fan, looks stylish, and it doesn’t make any noise.
 Very nice fan. Cools our family room very well. Well worth buying.
 Love it. Great fan!!
 Puts out a decent amount of air and the oscillating feature helps circulate the breeze. Remote is a nice touch. A little wobbly but still does a nice job in a 15x 20' room.
 Great value. Just wish it was more powerful.... but in saying that I find these fans are never powerful enough. I also have a dyson which is 6 times the price of this. The dyson has the same amount of power, but is much louder. So this is actually much more practical to the dyson. The dyson is just obviously much much more attractive.
 I bought this to help cool my room during the brutal summers of Nevada. My roommates complain about the power bill so they try to use the AC as little as possible. This fan has helped me survive the summer.<br/><br/>It's quiet but still noticeable on low. It doesn't bother me. I tone it out and forget it's even<br/><br/>Overall 9.5-10
 It works very well.  I put it at tthe foot of my bed and on low it is very powerful.
 really works great
 Although  we have central AC and a<br/>ceiling fan, our upstairs bedroom gets pretty hot at night.<br/>This fan is great - we don't use the remote but the oscillating feature is nice.<br/>It's not silent but we're fine with the low-key white noise.<br/>It cools the room quickly and looks much nicer than our old box fan.<br/>We recommend it.
 Well, yes, it is super quiet, but it doesn't work well at all.  Speed 3 is a less powerful than a regular fan on speed 1.  Very disappointed.  Sending it back for an exchange for a regular high speed fan.
 I had a basic Lasko tower fan my dad bought me in college. After 8 years (and roughly 5 moves) it finally gave out. Last year I bought the Lakso 40" Hybrid fan, loved it. Tall, quiet, efficient, remote control, timer, good looking and fit perfectly in my bedroom corner. Then, my bored German Shepard ate the cord.<br/><br/> I replaced the Hybrid with this Wind Curve; bought here on Amazon. Chose this fan because of the ionizer, height, remote, timer and it seems to be a top seller on many websites. While the quality is the durable Lasko brand, I don't care for this fan too much. It's bulky. At 42" I would say only 30" are fan blades, the rest is plastic stand. But, with the less fan blade, I find the power behind the "wind" is more, making it blow harder.....but this comes with a con.....noise. My master bedroom is right off the living room, when the door is open, fan on, I can hear the fan and have to turn the tv up. Not a huge deal. I do like some noise when I sleep, but on speed 3, the fan is pretty loud. Also, the fan is putting off a strong plastic chemical odor, I assume after a few weeks of use, this will subside. But I have to have a candle burning, scents on or my oil diffuser to drown out the heavy plastic odor.<br/><br/>A nice feature of this fan is the toggle button to adjust how high or low the blades blow, kind of like car a/c vents, you can adjust it up and down. This is great for me, as I have sinus issues so I can't have an overhead fan on, nor the fan right in my face. I will give this fan a few more days but I may go back to the Lasko Hybrid.
 Great buy.
 I like continuous air flow and white noise at night. This is perfect and having a remote is a nice perk.
 Best fan made! I ordered on line instead of buying at Lowe's,<br/>Home Deport or Wal-Mart as "Lasko" is the best brand.<br/>Very happy with my purchase.
 Really like this fan, just what we needed for the summer! It's really silent so you hardly know it's on expect for that super bright light on top that glares at you in the dark!! Other than that I wish it was a bit more powerful but I guess that's the compromise for the silent motor(?). Good buy!
 This was a great great purchase. It's hotter than a power yoga class in Seattle this summer! This has really made life a lot better Timer works great and it's pretty quiet. My friend has a Lasko tower as well and his is an older version, mine seems to be quieter than his :)
 I was looking for a fan that didn't take up too much space.  This looked perfect.  It looks nice and don't take up much space BUT if you are looking for a fan to stay cool THIS IS NOT THE ONE. It has no power behind it even though it has 3 speeds.  Also it says it oscillates but it barely turns.  I do not recommend this fan.
 Makes my bedroom cooler and cleans the air!
 This was a right choice. Smooth and efficient. I purchased mine in 2016. Now May 2018... 5 stars. No complaints. Summer 2018: still working perfect.  I gave one of this to my girlfriend...she loves me more lol
 We have a loft office and this fan could not circulate the air better up there! Quiet and powerful.
 Life saver in the summer. And yes it's quite. You just have to get used to the bright ION light at night.
 I debated for a while on this fan.  I'm glad I bought it, in fact after I had it for a few day I ordered a second 1 for the living room.  It is quite enough for a bedroom, in fact that's were the 1st 1 is and I love it.  I have read that some people had a problem with the blue light on the top but it does not bother me at all and if it was an issue you can just turn off the ION function and it will no longer be an issue.  The fan is quiter than any other i have ever had and I highly recommend it.
 If you are even thinking of getting one of those round fans from walmart that don't do anything but blow hot air back at you, you have got to try this fan. Instantly feel cooler and the height of the fan while on cools your room down. I order on for a friend and she loved it so much order another one for her bedroom
 great value
 Really it's a nice fan, however why pay extra for a feature such as a remote when you have to get up close to the fan for the remote to work? If you have to walk across the room to the fan to use the remote why not just push the button on the fan? I would have just as happy with a fan without the remote feature and saved a few bucks. The ION or whatever it's called that makes the air cleaner hasn't impressed me either. I guess that another feature I could have saved a few bucks on. Both of those features are why I chose this product. A week later I  bought a tower fan at a garage sale for $6. Just as happy with it.
 Absolutely love having this fan. We use it in the bedroom it’s not too loud to sleep through. Keeps us cool. However sometimes we prop it up on a laundry basket to give it better height for out bed
 Runs smoothly and  quiet.  Love it
 The fan was a lot bigger than I expected. We've had for a few months now and use it every night. Such a great fan and worth the money. If I ever have to get another fan I will definitely get another Lasko
 Bought this for my in law and it was just what they needed. The AC was too cold and they just needed a nice and reliable fan to circulate the air a bit. They're very happy with this by all account. Bought the warranty, but not sure if it was worth it.
 Works great, excellent air flow.
 Replacement for an old Lasko fan that died like 3 years after buying it.  This fan is high quality, looks really nice and is high enough to really keep a breeze going over me in bed.  Highly recommend this product!  It is fairly quiet.  I don't utilize all of the features (the timer), but they are available which is nice!
 it's too loud to use in my bedroom at night on the lowest setting.  Otherwise, it's a good product.
 Love it! Quiet, with multiple options. Love the ionizer-really freshens the air. The timer is a great feature too. And I LOVE the remote!
 This works extremely well &amp; directs air perfectly. Remote control is an added positive bonus.
 I am used to having box fans to help move the air around and always having to find a way to prop it up to hit us while in bed. This has been an awesome solution. And the best part is that it is so quiet, especially compared to a box fan. I really like this fan because it doesn't take up a lot of room, moves a fair amount of air, and does not sound like loud box fan doing it. We even bought a 2nd one for a small room to help cycle the air due to the space it takes up.<br/><br/>Now I am not saying this fan is small, but most of the fan is in its height.
 Works very well, For the power its pretty quiet. It cooled my room very well and my room is about 10x12ft.
 I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THIS TOWER FAN  -  WORKS VERY WELL  -  LOVE THE REMOTE  -  DOESN'T TAKE UP THAT MUCH ROOM AND IT DOES COOL MY TV ROOM IN THIS 90 DEGREE HEAT WE'RE HAVING  -  I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN
 Great product
 Defective fan would not turn off or change speeds.  Returned
 Reviews for this product have been either very strong or quite condemning.  Having just moved to Miami, I wanted a couple of these fans, and I liked the appearance and features of this one.<br/><br/>First, the comments about poor shipping boxes - right on the mark!  This arrived in nothing more than the box in which it would be sold at a retail store.  Mine had no damage, but like I said, I'd like to have two of these, and I do hesitate on whether to chance the odds that a second one might arrive undamaged.<br/><br/>The only construction of this product is to screw on the base, and they have made that process foolproof.  Once assembled, the fan is quite powerful, even in lower settings, and handles this 14x24 room very well.  It does not oscillate as much as others I've had (this is probably my sixth or seventh tower fan), but it is quiet and effective.  I don't have any opinion on the ionizer feature yet.<br/><br/>Having had quite a number of tower fans, I can say that these just won't last as long as the normal floor fans - regardless of brand.  If I get five years from one, I feel I've done well.  But for this one, so far, I'm very pleased.  Just keep your fingers crossed that it arrives to your door intact.
 I bought it for our living room but it's too weak. So my parents just put it in their bedroom. We have the regular Cyclone by Lasko, and it's actually better than this.
 Quietest fan I've ever owned, easy to put together. I'm so glad I found and ordered this fan!!
 Bought this as a replacement for another we had. Our daughter moved to California and it was easier to buy new and have it shipped to her than to box up the old one and ship it.
 great price, works fine
 1 bought 2. Both smells like burnt oil. Too much trouble to repackage and return. I let them run 4 days trying to get rid of the smell. The Wind Curve still smells so I have to throw them away. And, I had only choosen this type because Amazon isn't offering any other kind of tall standing fans.
 We've had this fan for 8 years, it went from four houses, a dorm room and two states. It finally just stopped blowing air so we had to buy a new one. Bonus: it is quiet enough not to wake our newborn and we are so happy they got rid of the beeping feature when you turn it on and off.
 love this fan. blows really cold air and not too loud
 Pros: Sturdy; Good Oscillation; Fans speeds are good for large rooms; Relatively Quiet<br/><br/>Cons: None really, but would have liked a breeze feature.<br/><br/>I don't use the Ion feature so I cannot comment on that.  Otherwise, overall a good purchase.
 We bought this fan as a supplement to our refrigeration that didn't get the bathroom as cool as we would like. What a difference this fan makes! It is so easy to use. Quiet and looks good. Life before the tower fan was a mad rush everyday to get my makeup on before I sweated it all off. Not any more.
 This fan works great to keep you cool! we need a little extra air at night since my both myself and my husband are hot natured. Only down side we have to put tape over teh bright blue light which you wont notice in teh day time but at night it lights up the room. Other then that it is great! and it even has a remote!
 Fan works okay but the remote for it is a total joke. Every time I use it it reminds me just how much I hate this fan. I should not have to hit the button 5 times to get it to work once.  And trying to get it to rotate to a particular place is just a nightmare, hit the button 5 times to get it to start, each time it comes around try to hit it a few times, maybe it works once, maybe it works twice and you have to wait for it to roll back around again to try again.
 The fan works great, and it makes just enough noise to act as white noise for my home office. The remote has something rattling inside of it, and one of the buttons tends to get stuck when I press it. Other than that, it works exactly as expected.
 Great fan especially for the price.
 The tower works well. I like that the base is elevated slightly off the floor. It helps to get the air moving over the bed vs those where the airflow begins at floor level.  Having the oscillating and remote features are nice. I ordered two of these and am happy with both. They were well packaged and simple to put together.
 I had high hopes this fan would be lacking significant sound. At first it seemed pleasantly quiet, but after using for approx. a month at various speeds the ambient noise continues to increase. Additionally, the remote never worked. I would likely return it if I was not lazy. Choose something else.
 Great buy, recommend this fan.
 It is a very well made fan, though it is not as strong as they make it sound.
 Everything works great. My only dislike is I keep it on high and it doesn't blow hard; however, I leave it on all day and my room stays cool. It's a bit loud but not to bad.
 I was hesitant to order this brand because I was familiar with the Ozeri. Wish I would have stuck with what I know but this one had an ionizer. It just doesn't put out the air like the Ozeri. It's ok, just not great.
 Really sleek looking, quiet and works great!
 I've been able to use this fan instead of the central air, and am very thankful! Noise level is great. I like to keep it on 3 so it reaches across the entire living room. With the remote, I can make it oscillate when I want it to from across the room.
 Not a bad fan. I just wish it was a little more powerful than it is. I returned this because I wanted a fan with more power. Ended up getting Lasko's High Velocity model instead. That one is super powerful. However, as for this one, it will definitely get the job done in terns if circulating the air around the room.
 I like the style of this fan. It does the job quietly. So far I'm please with this purchased.
 We are very pleased with this fan.  It is quiet and powerful and cools our kitchen very well.  I bought it for when the oven heats up the kitchen or when we have lots of people in the kitchen.  At least 6 adults have noticed it and its effective cooling. My dentist was using this fan and it almost froze me out of the chair!  That was when I asked for the make and model. It takes up less space than our old fan which had a 3-footed base.
 I am surprised that this tower fan is Amazon's Choice and rated as Best Seller! I received it and it works okay, but the air displaced at slow speed is minimal. I find its oscillation to be the worst feature, as it swings only about 45 degrees, which means it can cool about two people. The pedestal fans I have oscillate almost 180 degrees, and displace a lot more air very quietly. The only reason I opted for this fan is that the tower fans are supposed to be better looking and "trendier," whereas the pedestal fans seem kind of outdated, but I am not sure it serves my purpose, and I might return this and get a better one at Amazon or elsewhere.
 Keenly disappointed with this Lasko product.  It did not come with the four screws that are mentioned in the instructions.  If you don't have the screws in at just the right depth, the fan will not oscillate.  Very important to use short screws. Even on Level 3, it does not blow air as strongly as the previous Lasko model I had for 13 years.  Noise level is fine -- not library quiet, but bearable. You will ignore it after a few minutes. It's easy to pick up and move to another location. The remote control is easy to use and understand. I wish the old Lasko model I had was still available.
 Really like this fan... not hard to put the base together, just make sure you have the right side facing you... and of course I did not...at first... but realized right away before tightening screws!  It is quiet enough for a fan, and slim and out of the way!  The price was very good!
 Love this and the remote is very nice to have
 As opposed to regular round fans, this tower fan blows air across a wide vertical field.  It has good (not great) air volume and ocillates about 90 degrees by moving the entire unit in its base (rather than just the louvers).  Can't tell if the ionizer actually does anything.<br/><br/>Remote control works fine, but our proximity to the unit makes it redundant.<br/><br/>No problems, good value.
 Bought 2 of these before I purchased the Honeywell Breeze models.<br/>This fan has power,is quiet..but a bear to clean.<br/>Will stick with Honeywell from now on.diana b.
 Good air movement, but I had hoped for a bit more.  Well designed.  It's height really helps move the air where you need it moved most.  A little more of an electric hum than I've heard from other fans, but you get used to it.
 The best fan I've ever had. I can't sleep without it. Fits perfect in my small room. It's also got a remote control!
 This fan is very good. It ionizes the air, has 3 speeds and takes up very little space as it is a standup up. I only gave it 4 stars because the included remote doesn't always seem to work well.
 The ionize light is very bright; not the best for a light sleeper but not that bad. What is bad is that after about a month and a half of use, only at night, the fan began making a very loud ticking sound. Like something inside is repeatedly hitting another piece.
 Just what I needed to keep cool and eliminate noise!
 Love this fan, It is not noisy. Convenient to use. Has buttons for the amount of cooolness you want. Succesffuly cools the area in which the fan is pointing. The fan has the ability to rotate and even has an icon to clean the air. I am glad that I chose this fan. I am very satsifed with the price &amp; my purchase.
 We have low ceilings so couldn’t install a ceiling fan in the living room. This fan is so quiet and the air feels really cool!  Love the oscillating feature!  Looks nice in the living room - much better (and quieter) than a typical fan.
 I needed a fan I can use in my room when I sleep. The wife doesn't like having a fan on so I couldn't use the ceiling fan.  I aim this directly at me and we are both happy.  I like the remote that lets me change everything on it without me having to get up too.
 I like all of the features
 So far it works great!
 It is a good fan but does not blow as strong as my Ozeri Ultra 42" Wind Adjustable Oscillating Tower Fan. But it is a decent fan.
 this thing hardly blows air on the highest setting.  It looks pretty but it's basically worthless.
 Am loving this and keeping it running every night this summer.  It takes up little floor space (perfect for an NYC apartment) yet packs an airy punch, and I love the timer, multiple strength, rotating and ionizer options.
 Just ok
 Moves a lot of air and is stylish looking.
 The fan is great. The air output is great for the bedroom or kitchen. It was a little bulkier than i expected. I bought two of these fans and only  one of the remotes work. Kinda disappointed with that but all in all a great fan. Would buy again.
 Great air circulation and very quiet.  Just the right amount of white noise for a perfect sleep.
 Great price, super air flow. Kids love it during the summer.
 Works fine
 Easy to put together. Looks great! Easily moved from room to room if necessary.  A true lifesaver during the dreadful summer we endured in New York City area.  Used it in conjunction with air conditioning and ceiling fans to draw cool air into other areas of the home.  Highly recommend!!
 LOVE IT! Pushes a lot of cool air, I got it for our bedroom and we had to move it across the room it made it almost cold.
 Good for my 1 bedroom apartment.
 This fan is great! It pushes air around the room really forcefully. We usually use it on the lowest setting and still have to turn it off after a few hours.
 This is a good fan. It works quite well, however if you intend to use in a quiet environment, it can get rather bothersome.<br/>The good part is that it has a remote, timer, and the air ionizer, and it's pretty good for the price paid.<br/>On the other hand the noise makes it difficult to use it at night when trying to sleep or even to concentrate at work if you need silence.<br/>Conclusion: 3 stars is fair for this product.
 We’ve had this fan for two months and its dying. At first it was great, but now it sounds like marbles are rolling around inside it. Clearly something isn’t right inside, either from a defect of just a poorly made product.
 We love it. Very quiet and cools the entire living room. Would buy it again.
 Taller than I wanted (I didn't read the description) but I like them anyway. Nice burlwood accent, very QUIET. Push a lot of air.
 My fan broke so I had to shop for a new one. This was listed as "Best-seller" at a decent price and doesn't hurt the eye and it's not bulky. Had issues with UPS delivering it (but that's not why I'm giving it three stars), so Amazon stepped in and shipped it with a different, faster and more effective carrier. It still arrived scratched on top, though. It also wobbles AFTER I put it together, and I've double-checked all the screws and everything (and it does sit steadily on the floor), so I'm wondering if that's normative, or if I got a weird unit. But, so far it's been working, though I have no comparison to know if it works any differently than the rest of its kind.<br/><br/>So, as to the fan:<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Looks good<br/>- Doesn't take too much space horizontally<br/>- has a timer for up to 7.5 hours<br/>- Ionizes the air (purportedly)<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- wobbles (especially every time you press a button)<br/>- can't open it to clean it<br/>- it actually isn't that strong. My previous one was a regular round lasko fan for a 2/3 of the price and it was way stronger also at each of the tree speeds. It also covered more ground when swiveling.
 Kinda loud. Works well though
 i have a Lasko high velocity fan. last september i decided to purchase one for my son and thought i'd try this model. big mistake. i could barely feel the air even when sitting in front of it. returned it and purchased bought two more of the high velocity fans instead.
 Not too loud and has very strong breeze - even on low, I can feel it across the room. I've had other fans squeak when they rotate, but this one is smooth and makes no noise.
 Nice fan and big. Only complaint is that the remote could be more responsive. I sometimes have to push the buttons more than once. Otherwise, nice fan, and really like the timer option.
 Been a couple months... Motor makes mechanical noises.
 The quiet and powerful fan.
 I love the look of this fan and it works. Not loud in my office. Nice remote. Only small complaint is I had to hunt around for the screws. Not sure why they are not taped to the fan instead of at the bottom of the carton in a tiny, clear bag. But the fan is worth the hunt. :)
 Really nice looking fan and many friends have gone and bought one after seeing ours.  Is great inside or on a porch.  Has good force of air, nice remote and options of oscillating, speeds and the timer, plus the Ion option.
 Practically all my fans and room heaters are Lasko brand, They do the job well and are reliable.  This one did make a low rattling noise at first then it went away and now it's just the blowing noise - which you really get used to or don't hear after a while.  I recommend these fans (and heaters) for use in average size rooms.
 I'm in love. We had a traditional floor fan that the Motor went out on. Not only does this fan move the air well, it is very quiet Its footprint is small enough that even when oscillating, it takes up very little room. It is well made and appears that it will be an aesthetic plus for years to come.
 Perfect for a student like myself. This fan is really good and powerful enough for 3 people<br/><br/>It also has an Ionization option
 Small imprint in a room, puts out good fair flow. easy controls on top or use the remote, even has a remote slot so you don't lose the remote.The person who has this one in his room, needs all the help he can get with not losing remotes!
 This fan is amazing. It is very quiet and does a great job at circulating the air. It is very sleek and modern looking, and so much better than the classic pedestal stand fans. My only issue is that the remote is not very responsive. Otherwise, it is awesome.
 My husband says it exceeds the expectations, he uses at the office and it helps a lot!
 Works well
 Love the fan. It's big!
 I don't understand how this product has received so many good reviews when it hardly moves air around.I don't think the ionizer works either because I have another appliance with an ionizer and the room smells cleaner while it is running. It is quieter than many fans but what good is that if it doesn't blow much.
 We're very happy with our new fan so far. Blows air great and it's not too loud, just loud enough for white noise at bedtime.
 Its like a AC! Amazing plus I love the remote, timer, ion option.
 I use this fan every night and I love it.  It's actually more powerful than my old one, so I had to move it further away from my bed.  I like the remote and it's very quiet.  My only complaint is the light for the ionizer is really bright.  I have tape over it and it's still too bright.
 Very good buy
 Exact replacement for my previous purchase of this item.  The previous fan's electrics failed after about three years of use.  I liked the fan, so I simply purchased another.  Looks good, quiet, remote's handy.  I kept the old fan's remote, so now have one for each nightstand.
 fan works great, but lights on the front of the fan are obnoxiously bright. Not really sure if the Ionizer does much
 Cool.. Very cool!
 I love love love this fan! it does not take a lot a space on my tiny bedroom, and it can cool down the whole room. The remote and the timer aspect are an added perk! the only reason I did not gave it a 5 was when I received the package, It was missing the screws to connect the fan to the stand... I did not return the fan because I really really liked it but could you please send the screws!
 My son actually purchased this,the ionizer is amazing, cant even smell his stinky room when its on!<br/><br/>UPDATE: this fan is so great i bought one for myself!  Totally eliminates odors and whisper quiet!<br/>Update, update: two original fans still work awesome! Just bought a third fan for my other sons room.
 Loved it! had to buy a second one! Quite, moves air and I love the ionizer!
 this is a great fan.  just love it.  easy to put together (I still cannot figure out how anyone could put the support on upside down as one reviewer mentioned.... there are arrows, follow them.)  it gives a lovely breeze &amp; I like the optional rotation.  also looks good &amp; takes up little floor room.
 Perfect white noise for sleeping - creates a nice cool environment for a comfortable sleeping temperature. You can tell the differnece with the Ion option on vs off.
 This is by far the best tower fan anywhere!!  It looks esthetically pleasing as well!!
 Nice looking sturdy fan. The higest setting is just strong enough to help cool our living room which is about 15 x 20 feet...
 Great quiet fan- we have 2.
 Quiet but doesn’t move a lot of air. Wish I had returned it.
 As advertised, it is quiet on the lowest setting and provides good airflow in the medium sized den where we use it.  We also have a large 'box' fan which we use when we really want to get a lot of air into the house from outside.  Seems like a very good fan.
 The air comes out so refreshing. Nothing like a regular fan
 Great product; replacement for one I bought 10 years ago. Very good quality.
 very good and relatively quiet fan
 Works great and takes uses little space in our small home. Love the hook on the back to hold the remote control.
 We like the shape and design and all functions and of course, the remote.<br/><br/>The wind curve with its 3- speed and the "ion" option is most effective.<br/><br/>It would be even better to have a 4 or 5- speed control, possibly a<br/>2-step "ion" intensity, and a larger, i.e. wider swivel angle.<br/><br/>Thank you very much.<br/><br/>With best regards,<br/><br/>BC Koch<br/>bc-koch@earthlink.,net
 I received this and it was broken from the start .
 Works great and love the remote.  Also is attractive enough to look great in my living room ... Faux wood panel on front actually matches my furniture.<br/><br/>This is my 2nd Lasko  ... Have a slightly different model in my bedroom that still works great after 3 years.
 We've had this fan for a little over a month now and things are still great. It doesn't have much resting time, because when we're home- it's on. I read another review where someone said it didn't put off enough air for them, but we live in Alabama and it's pretty much always hot and this fan puts off plenty of force. Even now, I'm 7 feet away from it and it feels like I'm right on top of it. It's quiet and the osculate goes around enough to really cover most of the room. We got the silver and brown one and it looks just as pictured. I really appreciate the remote that comes with it so at night I can turn the speed down if I'm getting too cold.<br/>Truly, there's only one thing I wish they would change for future models and that's how light the bottom of the fan is compared to the rest of the fan. It's a very light, cheap plastic and not that the entire unit is very heavy, it's just a little too heavy for the base.<br/><br/>Still, it's a really great unit - especially for the price.
 Only use in bedroom at night.
 Where to start? First when I opened it, the screws that connect the base to the fan were missing. I went to Home Depot and purchased the same exact screws the pamphlet claims it took only to find out they were not the right size. After finally getting all of that situated, I thought things would change. Guess again.<br/><br/>This fan would be a fine fan for a bedroom but it is definitely NOT a fan for a large room like a living room or whatnot. I was skeptical to begin with because I wasn't sure how the tower style would circulate enough air throughout a large room, but after reading the reviews I bought into it... Literally. I cranked this puppy up to high and it does nothing for our living room. My work desk is in the corner of my living room, I've even put the fan blowing directly on me some 8 feet away and if it's actually hot outside the fan is worthless. Total bummer and very unhappy about the lack of air that this product blows.<br/><br/>SO, we went ahead and purchased a better fan for the living room and decided to move this puppy to the bedroom. It circulates fine as it rotates back and forth from a few feet away from the bed except for one thing... IT CREAKS!!!! We didn't have the fan more than 2 or 3 months before it was creaking like it needs an oiling. As it moves back and forth it sounds like a creaky door opening. Can you imagine listening to this noise every 10 seconds all night long?<br/><br/>So it was missing parts, it didn't do what we purchased it for, and then when we moved it to another room it made loud noises as it moved. With the summer of 2013 gone, I put it away in the closet. We pulled it out in 2014 and tried it all over again. Obviously with the same outcome. So back in the closet it went and where it still sits (until I feel like taking it out to the garbage).<br/><br/>Extremely unhappy with this product, and that's coming from someone who has purchased many Lasko fans and been perfectly happy with them. Truthfully it deserves one star, but I gave it two because at least it cools down a bedroom, but beware of the creaks that will imminently happen.
 Was pumping out cold air the minute turned on! I bought for my daughters room which gets a lot of sun and hard to keep cool.
 Enough to cool my whole room, love that it's an ionizer, has a timer, and oscillates. Definitely a great buy and worth the money!
 Bery nice
 Great fan, even lowest setting it's pretty powerful. Wish it were a bit quiter though but overall happy with it.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R2PCNISHER2SQO"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91a7JMAOupS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91lYl0G12wS.png"/> Good fan. It puts out nice airflow, however, the plastic smell is super strong. When I assembled the fan it would only the base on the unit is so it's offset. The fan is still workable but it's killing my OCD.
 So far so good!  Works very nicely.  Wish it put out a bit more air on the high setting, but in all, it works nice.  Looks nice too.  No complaints.
 I bought this fan to give me some air circulation in my new place and I was hesitant to purchase something like this online and was pleasantly surprised with it.<br/>Super easy to put together, easy to navigate the controls (especially the timer function) and I absolutely love the remote so I don't have to leave the comfort of my bed at night to turn the fan on after the timer goes out.<br/>Good purchase. =)
 Got this for my office, and I use it every day. It's been with me through a move and still works great. The walls in my office are seemingly paper thin, so the fact that this fan sounds slightly like a white noise machine actually works in its favor here. Otherwise, it occasionally gets stuck in an annoying clicking pattern at which point I simply lift it off the ground and shake it a bit and it subsides. Good job, fan!
 loud, lights are stupidly bright, and you can't access the inside to clean it without removing 10 or more screws, would not recommend if you want to sleep through the night.
 Package came in original boxing and was heavily damaged. Not sure who to blame for this. Put the fan together, super easy to set up. But it makes a rattling noise. Assuming this is due to the damaged box. Needless to say, I’m disappointed.
 Wife thinks its too cold but I love it. Keeps us nice and cool during this hot ass summer.
 I have two - one for the living room and one for the bedroom. The white noise and movement helps me sleep. I have seen these in th conference rooms at work and decided to get a couple. I also bought two more for Mother's Day gifts. Everyone really likes them.
 I'm cold, husband hot... Here's our solution! We can keep the central air on my preference and he keeps this on his side of the bed. Not too noisy and I've come to enjoy the hum!
 The first one got lost in shipping. Skip forward 1 week: works great.
 I bought the same model couple of years back. Loved it.  So ordered again, for the second room. You can't go wrong with this fan. Has minimum overall footprint in the house but circulates fan at a fairly long distance from its base. Light weight and portability is yet another convenience to make this a better value. I saw it in the local market as well however, Amazon had the best price.
 after getting the bottom installed on the device this fan is awesome. It makes some noise but nothing like what I had in my room before.
 Works great! My husband loves it
 This fan works fine, but the plastic material is a bit cheap looking and the brown plastic wood paneling is odd. If I'd seen it in the store, I would have probably looked for something a bit sturdier.  We are keeping it at least for now. It does what it needs to do.
 This fan is AWESOME! And I'm ordering a 2nd one
 where has this been all my life! Feels like A/C cooled air, very quiet, and blends in nicely with my décor. I've already recommended to a couple family members. Easy to assemble the base as well.
 Very quite, but puts out a lot of air! We’ve raised our thermostat trying to lower our electricity bill &amp; this has been a life saver!
 liked the first one so much we bought a second one!  The fan really isn't that loud at the highest setting and it puts out a good breeze.  would purchase again.
 I have night sweats and this if the first fan that has given me relief so that I can sleep. My bed is really tall from the floor, so I did have to raise it higher off the floor, with a box, and with the solid base, it's just fine…. it's not silent, but a whole lot more quiet then other fans I've had, and quiet enough to act as ambient noise... the only negative thing is the blue light that turns on with the ionizer, it is so small, but it lights up the whole room at night, so I just leave the ionizer off until I can get some electrical tape to cover it up.
 This was such a great purchase. It has lived up to all my expectations. The features of timer, speed of fan, and oscillating aspects give you many options to make for a great nights sleep. The only reason I did not rate this a 5 star is due to like many other have mentioned is the IONIZE feature; the blue indicator light is too bright. However, with a little piece of black electrical tape that problem was remedied. I am now able to utilize the ionize feature all the time without the disturbance of the bright blue light.
 Just what we needed to cool down the room in the middle of the night. Love the remote feature and the oscillating feature. Totally worth every penny.
 It's not really worth the money not really powerful enough wish I could return
 I've using it for about a month now, it works great for me
 This fan works GREAT! Use it on our patio to keep small bugs and bees from flying around while we are sitting outside. It is easy to pick up by the cut out handle on top and carry around. The remote works great for changing settings as desired. I highly recommend this fan.
 Our son loves it.  Puts out a good volume of air and circulates well.
 Super duper
 This is a very nice fan. It's quiet but moves the air to cool our living room. Very glad we decided to order this one.
 Been using it for more than a year. Fan circulates air very well and everything else is as advertised. However, the oscillating mechanism has been a hit or miss for me. Some days, the fan just won't oscillate.
 Great fan!! Nice size (doesn't take up a lot of floor or desk space), nice looking, quiet, three speeds, rotates, remote control. Perfect to cool off a small hot room.
 For a large room, it is powerful, quiet and nice looking. I will order again the same.
 Poor Product Quality, good capability and generally met performance expectations:<br/><br/>Use / application:<br/>• Bedroom fan used only at night<br/><br/>Expectation<br/>• Quite on low speed with sufficient air flow<br/><br/>The Good:<br/>• Product received in good condition, no external damage to the box.<br/>• Unboxing and assembly was easy enough, took maybe 10min from unbox to power on.<br/>• Very Quit with sufficient air flow (minus the Clicking noise detailed below)<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>• When first powered on, the fan blade rotation made a significantly loud clicking noise.<br/>• After two days I came into the bedroom and noticed the fan was on, and it was on speed 2! This was odd in two ways, first I was sure I had turned it off, and second I only use it on speed 1 (Low).  I tried to turn the fan off with its power switch on the unit, and it would not turn off, I tried with the remote, still would not turn off, I cycled through most of the control setting to no avail. The only way to turn it off was by unplugging it. Also of note, during this exercise, in notice a faint electronic burning smell.  Being an engineer, in knew this was not a good sign and that most likely something had failed or shorted out on the control board.  End of story!<br/><br/>Returned product for refund and bought another brand “Seville Classics UltraSlimline Tower Fan” a similar style. Which I am so far still happy with. It is slightly noisier on its lowest setting (ECO), but not by much. It also has a better remote. Too early to judge its reliability as I have only had it about 1 Month.
 So far works great. Wish it was a bit more powerful<br/>In air. Hope it doesn't break down before the year like some of the reviews I heard. So far I'm pleased it does the job. Name brand logo was a bit dented.
 Very quiet compared to the similarly designed Sutter brand from Costco and it moves more air.  Plus no annoying beeps.
 Great
 It looks nice and it's pretty functional. I decided to return it because it was much louder than I expected. Now I'm happily sleeping with Vornado 630. Missing remote tho.
 Works great and with the tall design you can get good airflow even if you have a high bed frame. It does get a little noisy when you change speed to 2 or 3 but it didn't bother me.
 After my divorce I moved in with my best friend, who has the the biggest and warmest heart...but who is always freezing. LOL...!!<br/>I, on the other hand, am always sweating. As a German, I will never get used to the sweltering heat in Florida... At my old house, I'd turn down the A/C to 68F to be able to sleep comfortably. My friend had the A/C set to 85F during the day, and 78F during the night. She felt comfortable; I felt miserable...<br/>The house is quite large; and besides not wanting her to freeze to death after being so kind to her best friend, and not wanting her electricity bill to skyrocket, I started researching other solutions to our "heated" dilemma.<br/>The Lasko Platinum had many very positive customer reviews, so I decided to give it a try.<br/>Even the "whisper setting" (1) is quite noisy, but I've gotten used to it surprisingly quickly; I have the fan running on this setting through the entire night. Sometimes I use the setting 2, especially after a shower (to cool down). The highest setting 3, I only use when I'm not in the room. It is really noisy.<br/>The Lasko is definitely louder than a ceiling fan on highest speed; however, it cools down the room (and me) much quicker and more efficiently. My dog was afraid of it at first but now lays down directly in front of it to get cooled down after a long walk or playtime.<br/>I would highly recommend this product. It is NOT a portable air conditioner; so please keep that in mind. It is; however, a really good fan for the price.<br/>I have set the oscillating function all the time.
 This fan is amazing.  It cools off a room quickly and by far one of my best purchases!
 Love this fan!
 If you're looking for a fan that doesn't take up much space, but still creates a FABULOUS breeze, this is just the thing! I was hesitant to buy one, I was really looking for the kind of fan that sits into the window frame, but I'm very glad I bought this instead! Especially sitting in front of the window on my dresser, this is an awesome fan, moves lots of air, and really isn't all that loud. I think it's quieter than the 'box' fan variety that I've had before. Certainly quieter and more efficient than the round fans that are up off the ground a few feet. Excellent value.
 Highly disappointed!!  Maybe I just got a bad one, but this thing is loud.  Set up in den in a triangle w fan one corner,  then tv and couch at the other corners each prob 15 apart.  Had to turn the t.v. way up to cancel out fan, and even then there's a loud humming.  Already looking for a replacement. Just trying to decide of its worth packing back up and returning.<br/><br/>Ive had other tower fans that cost less, produce more air and are quieter at the same time.  Unfortunately they don't make the model anymore and this seemed to be the best option for the color and features needed. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I am dissatisfied.
 Perfect fan. Doesn't take up much space and saved me a lot of money in the summer. I didn't use to use my central air lol. Plus very elegant. I love it. I use it every day and nite and it gets cold.
 I bought this fan in April of 2016 and it worked great for about 7 months. Now, once the fan is on for about ten minutes, it starts to make a high pitched squealing sound every 30 seconds or so. It is absolutely obnoxious. The fan itself still works well and how it's supposed to, but at this point it should probably come with ear plugs as well.
 Very attractive. Very quiet. Very efficient.
 The fan works well, but does not really cool the room down that much. The fan would have to be on high speed constantly on you to do anything. The remote does not work for me.. so that's annoying. Also, the box I recieved it in was damaged--not sure if it was the handling of shipping or if I got a used one??
 Running the air conditioner in the Texas heat gets expensive. I wanted a fan that could help cool the family room (where we spend most of our non-sleeping time) without running the A/C constantly. My neighbors have a Lasko fan that is very similar to this one, and I was impressed by how well it worked.<br/><br/>First of all, kudos to Amazon for super-fast delivery. I am a Prime member, but got it in one day, not two.<br/><br/>The fan was packed securely, but easy remove from the box. All of the parts arrived in perfect condition. The assembly instructions were simple and I was able to attach the base in just a few minutes, working by myself. (HINT: Put the top of the fan on the floor, using the styrofoam ring from the package to hold it steady.) The base is steady on carpet as well as hard flooring surfaces.<br/><br/>There are three speeds and even the lowest speed cranks out a stream of cool air. Although a fan does not actually cool the air, this one provides enough air movement that you feel a nice cooling breeze. (Crank it up and it feels a little windy!) I always run it in the oscillation mode to really move the air around the room.<br/><br/>Ionizers seem like a gimmick to me, so I don't care one way or the other that this fan has one. If the blue light bothers you, turn off the ionizer. It shouldn't really make any difference.<br/><br/>The one negative is that you need a clear line between the remote and the fan to use the remote. No waving the remote in the general direction of the fan while clicking a button, you need to aim carefully. Of course, you can also use the timer to let the fan turn itself off automatically.<br/><br/>This fan is an excellent value. I plan to buy at least one more for my upstairs office.
 I bought this to cool my room at night, as the A/C is too loud to sleep through. It does the job, and is really remarkably quiet for the amount of air it moves around.<br/><br/>I like the remote control too - I can change the speed and direction without getting out of bed!<br/><br/>Not sure what the ion feature does, but I don't really care....
 I love this fan!  It works very well and keeps me cool in the kitchen while I'm cooking.  It reaches quite far across our great room of our open floor plan.  I bought this because a friend of mine had one and I was impressed how well the fan worked in her living room.  I'm quite happy that I bought one.  It keeps me from having to put the A/C on.
 Works great. Very quiet.
 I've had this fan for over 1 yr, works great except for the slight rattling noise you hear w/in 5 ft of fan. The fan is very powerful
 Very good fan. My room didn't have a fan and my ac doesn't work that well. So I needed a fan or something to cool things down. This fan is perfect for anyone looking to cool down the room or to keep it on you. For the price you get more than expected. I would buy this again and refer to a friend!
 Just as advertised!  It is tall enought to move the air over the bed and quiet enough to not wake you.  On the low setting it is very quiet while still providing a good breeze.  It seems to make the air a couple degrees cooler, which is a plus to me.  Highly recommend!
 Works well enough.  I like all of the settings.  I'm not bothered by the noise level either.
 Yay!  It works.  I'm still not quite sure what the heck ionizing does to dust, but now, the air is clear (but oddly I have to dust a lot of stuff all of the sudden).  Its also much quieter than expected.
 Great FAN, it works great, quiet and smooth cool air. idk how it cleans the air and its a bit difficult to clean it, also the remote needs to be close to the fan, but it works great. I would buy it again
 Nice product
 works great
 Easy to put together however the round base is very wobbly no matter how secure you try to put it on. It does make a sound when it’s on. I thought it would be quieter.
 Received my fan today. Set up was a breeze. Seems to work good. Remote doesn't work. (Yes, I tried batteries). Calling the 1800 number tomorrow. I'll update.<br/>Update: Lasko sent out a remote no problem! Was here in a few days! Great customer service. New Remote works!
 The workloads is not equal to the volume.big body only for small business . Disappointed
 Great
 Best fan ever
 I bought one after needing more air to circulate in the bedroom at night. This has kept me from lowering the A/C at night.  I will have to eventually buy one for my kids room.  Highly recommend.
 Blows sufficient air, but VERY noisy.  You hear the whine of the motor. You actually hear the movement of the fan.  Choose something else!!
 What a fan. Super deluxe air quality. It may not be the most powerful but the quality of air flow is top notch for the price. It is hard to keep away from this fan once it's turned on!
 I love this fan!  It actually cools the air.  The fans I've had before just push the hot air around.  This fan is tall and has a  slim profile so it doesn't take up much room.  I love, love, love having a remote!  I bought 2 additional fans for other family members.  We would be miserable without these fans.  Some reviewers have said its loud.  Well, it's not silent, but seriously, it's just not a problem.  We still sleep just fine, it doesn't keep us awake.  Buy the fan!  Enjoy the cool...
 motor has a whine. on all speed . not acceptable!oi
 The minute we plugged it in, there is a pronounced ticking from the motor, even on the quietest setting. Back in the box it goes and over $12 to return. Yay!
 Nice.
 we have had the box fans, the window fans, the circular on the stand and this fan is better than any of the other ones, and is not the only fan we use regularly.  Its so much quieter and more powerful and adjustable.  The remote sounds like just an "extra" but to be able to adjust it from bed is very helpful, and also the timer is really good to allow it to go off automatically.<br/><br/>Looks great as well, very sturdy.
 Does what was advertised efficiently, quietly and economically. Potential purchasers should be aware that the machine is quite tall. Be sure to check the space allocation where the machine needs to stand.
 surprisingly powerful in moving a lot of air. I used it to distribute cold air from two small windows A/C's throughout a five room house in a summer that ran in the mid 90's. It basically more than doubles the coverage area of the window A/C's.
 Classy looking, works well.<br/>Thought it was bulky at first but now I hardly notice it.
 This fan is awesome, especially for the times at night when the AC kicks off. This fan does a great job at keeping the air circulating and the room cool. I ordered one for my parents too.
 I love this fan.  I read the reviews and wondered about the "blue light" but I did not find this to be a problem in any way.  Maybe they have improved it.  I travel with it to stuffy rooms.  The timer works wonders for me since I have trouble falling asleep right away.
 Powerful and sounds great!
 It doesn't move as much air as a regular propeller fan. Lower your expectations when it comes to air movement. It looks good and probably would work well in a very small room
 So far this seems to be really good. It's relatively quiet, much taller than our other tower fan, which means air actually gets to us when we're sleeping. We haven't used the ionization feature yet, but everything else is great so far.
 most of the time you have have to push the button on the remote a few times while moving your hand around to find the right spot for it to work..would've given 5 stars if the remote worked better.
 The fan seems loud if you are trying to sleep. The noise it makes is pretty unnatural so it's not like white noise and if you are in a small room and bothered by this, it may not be the fan for you. Also the leds are very bright and cannot be turned off. I like it dark, cool and quiet so I put this fan in the kids room. The remote and timer are pretty cool features.
 Fans are nice fans are great. Fans feel good when your sleeping. I like this fan
 This is a great fan that will cool down a small room
 Better than I hope for and functions are easy to use
 This fan lost stars on two fronts: 1) false advertising about country of origin, 2) very wobbly<br/><br/>I chose Lasko simply because they are one of the few fan companies that still makes its products in the US... or at least, they used to. Despite the place of origin being listed on the description as the US, when my product arrived the box was marked "made in China". I could've bought a cheaper, similar fan for that. I'm not totally against buying foreign-made products, but I try to buy US made when I can and I definitely don't like being told a product is something that it isn't. Very disappointed with the false advertising and with Lasko for choosing cheap labor over providing jobs for their community.<br/><br/>That being said, the fan works well &amp; pushes out a good volume of air. Even on medium setting it can be felt from across my large (16'x15') bedroom. It is not very sturdy on its base, however. The base is thin, cheap plastic, not weighted at all, and with the fan being so tall, that causes a high center of gravity that means that the fan wobbles slightly when oscillating. It doesn't seem likely to fall over, though, so I'm keeping it, since I really needed a fan &amp; don't want to wait on returning &amp; shipping a replacement. The remote needs a very direct line of sight, and so is close to useless. It does make a little noise, but not a lot. The noise is not unpleasant either, just a white-noise fan sound that I like for falling asleep to.
 It does okay job. I am not too impress as even on high speed it's not all that great.
 Its either I got a defective unit or everyone else is having an entirely different experience than I am. From day 1 the unit did not blow cold air, but instead was blowing out room air temperature. This made the room even hotter.
 I got this for my son's apartment in Houston and he says it works great.  It is so hot there and he is on the third floor, plus he hates to overuse air conditioning.  This fan cools his place down and looks nice in apartment.
 Fan broke the other day I was in apartment for 2 years and never used this thing and in my new house I go to use it a couple times now its broken.  DO NOT BUY.  NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL.  Lasted maybe being used for a month.
 I bought this fan under the assumption that it would be a quiet fan since my trainer's studio has several of them that are very quiet. The fan suits my cooling needs, but the fan has an annoying rattle that I cannot figure out how to stop. If it had no rattle, this review would be 5 stars, but the rattle ruins the experience for me.
 Very attractive fan and features but the fan is not real powerful. The idea of getting this fan was to help summer cooling by the bed. With a king size bed only ONE person can feel the affects. The remote is really not needed and kind of a gimmick IMO.
 We like the size and features, but overall it is built a bit cheaply and quite noisy when oscillating. Why don't the manufacturers learn that we will pay an extra buck or two for better quality. Somewhat disappointed in WI
 Awesome Fan! Does not make too much noise, but the blue Ion light can light up a whole room.
 This fan still technically works, but after 3 months it has developed various rattles that make it unbearable for the bedroom at night.  It would be fine somewhere with a lot of other background noise, but if you want it quiet, than I would spend a little more money for another brand.  It is imported from China and it comes looking pretty cheap.  I have ordered a Honeywell fan and I hope I have better luck with that one.
 Simply elegant, didn't make a lot of noise. Good wind speed but probably isn't good for very hot weather.
 This was not too big and noisy. I didnt need to use my air conditioner all the time. It had a nice finish that matched the furniture in my house. Very easy to store away in a corner.
 have four of these -- would buy again whenever needed.  Have two that I've used for several years and bought two more in recent years and months.  quiet, efficient, remote control; and ion setting --
 Love this fan. Only complaint is the base seems a little cheap. It puts off nice air and doesn't make a ton of noise.
 Lasted only 2 months
 It's ok but you have to take it apart frequently to remove collected dust.  Yuck.
 Pushes nicely, but it's not a quiet fan. Simple three speeds is great. If noise is not a requirement for your application, then it makes a good vertical fan. The low cost makes it an excellent value.
 I love that this fan has a remote.  Perfect for use from bed!
 Everything was awesome until yesterday. I have barely touched the damn thing and it’s making this ridiculous vibrating sound now and it’s loud as **** and I am over it. Was quiet for 2 months now nothing fixes it.
 This fan is fantastic. Its the perfect height to get all heights of a regular sized room. It doesn't just blow around the air the ionizer actually blows cool air. Helps for the days you don't want to use AC but still need it to cool off a little.
 Bought two of these.  They work well.  I recommend you purchase one if you are in the market.
 Stopped working wishing 2 weeks.
 really nice fan very durable my only complaint is that it does not blow out hard
 I had one of these in my previous apartment but had to leave it behind. It's hands down one of the best fans I've ever owned. It's relatively quiet, even on the fastest speed. It looks really nice and has a good range. Good fit for my small room.
 Bad humming noise, immediate return.  We have the older lasko fan and it’s actually much quieter, no annoying humming.  We tried the fancy $330 Dyson and that was even louder and medium speed!  Truly amazing there isn’t a quiet stand up fan on the market that is somewhat quiet.  Regardless of cost.
 i bought this fan and less than 20 days later it stated making a really loud sound i thought i was bugging but the sound just got louder and louder i had to pay 34 dollars for a box to return this fan so i lost money .. do not recommend
 Thought it would blow out colder air. Still a great price for the item
 Got it to replace our old standard fan that stopped working. Works great, and love how little space it takes up.
 It works very well at first. However, just after the return period it became to a 'bad boy'. It will turn on/off automatically and suddenly.....so creepy
 Good for white noise, cold air and over all airflow. I have to sleep with this fan or the ringing in my ears will keep me up constantly. Shipping takes forever in a day unless you have Prime so be ready to wait....
 Best fan I’ve ever had! I live in California and even when it’s 95 degrees outside this fan keeps my home cool. We have a bearded dragon which requires a heat lamp and it makes my sons room pretty warm so I will definitely be buying another for his room!
 ok
 Moves lots of air, but without a lot of noise.  The fan is still audible, as expected, but the "drone" of the fan is not nerve grating.
 Great fan. Very quiet. Well made. Excellent product. Best fan I have ever bought. Cools room 14 x 16 with no problem.
 Love this fan I bought 2
 I'm very happy with the fan. Everything works as it should but when it got delivered it looked like it's been through he'll. The box was torn and had a huge hole in it and it seemed like the whole thing was held together by a ton of packing tape.
 Works great, highly recommend.
 I purchased this fan for my bathroom and it is great, especially the ionizer and timer.
 The fan speed and rotation feature is good. It looks elegant too. I am not very much comfortable with the AC always and wanted an alternative as I live in a cold place. This fan was a perfect solution for it.
 Arrived as described. Front of fan has nice wood grain style. Nice and quiet. Remote is great feature. Easy to assemble base. Bought 2. Does not come with batteries for remote.
 Works as good as the favorable reviews. Ours, however, makes a sort of grinding noise at the end/beginning of each oscillation. If we jiggle it a bit, it quiets down.
 Bought it on amazon after reading the reviews and I was skeptical about the force of the air. It is true that at max speed, the air is just a breeze which would be fine for a small room. If you have a large room and it is hot, this one is of no use. Fortunately I have Bionaire that has better air force than this. Overall, I would recommend this fan for a smaller room. If you are the type that needs to feel the air, this may not be the one.
 Very quiet and pretty powerful. Love this!<br/><br/>Remote is terrible... you have to press the buttons about 100x before it gets picked up. Batteries get loose really easily which is probably the main issue.
 All of the reviews on here that say this bad boy can move some air ... not joking! I've not yet used it above this lowest setting, and it can quickly cool my living room.
 This fan is fantastic! It is quiet and the choice of settings is great; these along with the Ionizer feature make it a great buy. However, the remote is a piece of junk. Only works about 1/4 of the time which is why I cannot give it a full five stars.
 Keeps my room cool all throughout the night and has an elegant design especially for the price!
 Nice. Might order another one for the convenience of not having to carry it up stairs at night.
 Great product just what i was looking for to replace one i'd had over ten years!!!
 Fast delivery, when summer heat continued into fall.  Works well in a large Living Room. Out of the box, plug it in, ready to go.
 Love it sińce it is so quiet, light so you can bring anywhere.  Thank you.<br/>Teresa Mucha from Ct
 I received this fan much faster than I expected. It required some putting together as the base has to be attached to the tower.  Assembly was a cinch, requiring only a Phillips screwdriver. The fan works even better than expected. I use it in an upstairs bedroom where there is no ceiling fan. The fan makes it possible to open a window on cool nights, as it circulates the air, feeling almost like air conditioning. The remote is an added benefit. It is simple to arrow up or down to change the fan setting. The noise from the fan is almost unnoticeable. I recommend this fan to anyone looking to cool a room, improve air circulation, or supplement air conditioning.
 I bought two of these, because the price was right. There is about a foot at the bottom of the fan (which is obvious if you look at the picture) where it doesn't circulate air, and I wish that it was lower by about a foot so that it didn't look so imposing in my small room, but it's not the end of the world. It's quiet and slim and doesn't have annoying feet to trip over; and that is the main thing we were looking for.
 Bought very sightly used on Amazon Warehouse. The box was a bit worse for wear but the fan inside looks and works fine. It has a little rattling sound when it is on. I can't help but wonder if that sound would be there if I actually bought it new.<br/>Worth the savings all in all.
 Very happy with my purchase. Arrived well packaged and easy to set up. Very quiet when it's running, even on full power. Comes with remote, but not batteries. While I've only had the fan a little over a month, I feel like this one will last.
 Purchased in June of 2016 stopped working today. Guess $35 a year isn't bad. Just thought anyone buying this fan should know the life if the fan fir $70
 This fan does everything a tower fan should do.  Ours has now been running non stop for over a month (on level 2 of 3) and you can barely hear it running.  Lev el three actually moves too much air for the room we have it in (12' x 13').  We will be purchasing another of these when one of our other fans gives up the ghost.
 Can't beat the price, and not too noisy! I'm happy with this purchase :)
 Have used this for approx 1 month now. As advertised and on time. Sharp looks and quiet enough. Moves air fine.
 Love it, My air condition just went out. So this product arrived just in time! =- 5 stars indeed!
 I LOVE THIS FAN!!! I read some of the reviews before I purchased and they didn't steer me wrong. It doesn't take up a lot of space. It's QUIET. It cools our living room. It's perfect!
 I love this fan looks super fancy I thought I didn't need the remote but it definitely comes in handy reasonably priced compared to other fans that are less in quality
 This fan packs a good punch for its size. It does take up alot of room and is about 4ft tall. Similar fans cost more than this one on avg. Would recommend.
 First one didn't have all the screws needed.  Second one rotates less than 1/4th the way.
 I just got my fan yesterday, and I absolutely love it! It's just as quiet as other reviewers have mentioned. It doesn't make a sound! Sometimes I forget it's in the room! It is VERY tall, which is a great feature for me because I need the fan to be able to reach the height of my bed. Then, it has a great look with its wood-grain exterior and gray finish.<br/><br/>As far as the wind power, it is okay. It's not what I expected it to be based on the reviews of it feeling like an "air conditioner on low." Maybe it feels that way in a room that has other cooling systems already. It does blow amazingly cool air without the noise, so it definitely gets the job done!<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's only been two days, so maybe I should give it more time. But, overall, I absolutely love the fan already and do not regret buying it.
 This is an awesome oscillating fan. It's very tall almost 3.5 ft. The air is cooled and very quite. The delivery was on time.<br/>I definitely recommend this product.
 I bought this fan with the intention of cooling my room down, not like an air conditioner, but to keep air moving around so it isn't stagnant. I live in San Diego, and it's never really THAT hot here so a fan is all I really needed. I got that and more with this, up to 7 hours of sleep timer functions, three speed setting, an ionizer and a remote that handles it all wirelessly.<br/><br/>It's much quieter than any box fan I've ever used, sometimes I forget its even on when even the TV is off on its level 1 speed. Level 2 and 3 definitely get the job done while still maintaining a quiet demeanour. It's quiet in its day to day operation, no creaks or weird sounds from it whatsoever. I might buy another one for my parents, it's a hell of a fan.<br/><br/>If there is ANYTHING I could complain about, it would be the remote, it won't pick up anything past 10 feet away and even when I'm as close to 5 feet from it it'll lag on picking up the signal. I know the remote is firing 100% I checked with infrared if the laser is going off.
 as expected
 We use this in our bedroom and it cools us down noticeably during the summer months. Somewhat wobbly base and I wish this has a little more power as my wife keeps in on her side and I don't get the full effect on my side.
 Great fan!  Easy to move where needed in your home.
 Pretty quiet. Great size for larger rooms. Great airflow. No issues on arrival. Product arrived as described.
 If your getting it for the noise to sleep this is not the one. Its very quite. It didnt have a remote but perfect for small places!
 I love this fan  my girlfriend has really bad allergies and is allergic to dust and this has been a life saver. Especially after i vacuum the room and it is dusty. It purifies the air and is very quiet you won't notice it is on especially when you are doing things around the house.
 Avoid buying if you want an actual fan. Does not move much air, even on high. My 15 year old box fan does a better job.
 Best fan I've ever had. Very quiet
 Pretty quiet, moves a lot of air. Good value at this price. Any better performance, quieter operation will cost a lot more than this model
 Love this fan. It's quiet and blows air really well
 Great and powerful fan.
 I use it daily during the summer and have been able to avoid buying an air conditioner thus far
 Very disappointed, breeze from this fan is minimal and does very little  to no cooling at all.
 Doesn't blow much air for it's size. Makes noise at low speed
 Great fan. Circulates air thru the room and the ionizer is a nice touch.
 So far so good. I have been using this fan for a few months and it has served me well. The blue light is VERY bright (the air ionizer) -- I read the reviews before purchasing this and saw that everyone seemed to comment on the intensity of the blue light -- I am going to have to concur. I originally shrugged it off thinking I could handle the light for the sake of cleaner air but now that I'm writing this review months after the fact, I realize I don't think I've EVER actually used the ionize function because I mainly use the fan while sleeping at night. I guess for day use it would be a non-issue, I just haven't used it.<br/><br/>Other than that I would say it's been mostly great. I really like the wide oscillation range and I really like how the remote has its own inconspicuous dock inside the fan. I also like that it doesn't have an obnoxiously loud beep when turning on or changing the settings - my last fan was SUPER loud when pushing the buttons but this one is a lot quieter than that and tolerable.<br/><br/>My complaints:<br/><br/> -- I don't know if it's just that the batteries get drained quickly by the remote or if there is a flaw within the remote itself, but I recently started sleeping with the remote within reach and found that sometimes the fan does not respond to the remote prompts.<br/>-- In my personal opinion, it doesn't have the best (aka sturdiest) base -- I'm chalking it up to it being constructed out of plastic.<br/>-- The blue light - Way too bright for nighttime use if trying to sleep in the same room<br/>I'll update my review when there's more to say. Overall, I am happy with it.
 The three speeds are at the perfect settings and the ionizer makes me feel as though the air is so clean the outdoors should have one. It has a good height so it can stay on the floor instead of being raised up onto a table. The rotation is very smooth and the unit as a whole makes barely any noise at all. I love it!
 I wanted to give this one time before reviewing and let me tell you, works great and has exceeded my expectations. This has remote control and very far distance of signal. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a fan.
 Great product, performs as claims.  The remote control is very useful.  My son uses the fan in his bedroom and the remote is handy to adjust the fan in the middle of the night.
 Not sure if the ionizer is built in, but no switch and can’t tell the difference from a regular fan. Not very powerful, even on high. Got a better response from a Vornado floor fan.
 Really does it’s work! Freshens up the room! Bought this because my central air broke and it became useful!
 Love this fan.
 nice unit
 Definitely recommend
 This fan is a lifesaver in a college dorm. It's pretty strong and can cool down your room fairly quickly. The only downsides are its somewhat short cord and how it doesn't rotate completely. Minimal space used and easy set-up.
 very quiet and good amount of air output...nice looking with the wood grain ...a bit pricey but works well

Arrived while on vacation.  Opened shipment and discovered there were no screws provided for assembly. Unable to contact distributor.
 I love my unit I just received it put it together in five minutes,  have it going in the bedroom, turned off the AC and all the fans.  I live in Nevada and it is mid summer thank you very much and I hope you enjoy yours
 The LASKO 42" WIND CURVE tower fan is Great, much better than the old fashioned fan with the round head and blades that I had for years.<br/>The amount of air it blows, even on the slowest speed, is HUGE. In fact, the slowest speed on this tower fan blows more air than the highst speed on my old fan.<br/>The fan comes assembled, only the base needed to be attached and a Phillips screwdriver is all you need. It took all of 2 minutes.<br/>Operating the fan is very easy and it has a small remote control with all the features of the tower fan on it, not just on and off.  This fan is very quiet which is wonderful. It also looks sleek and trendy. Highly recommended!
 Love this fan! I am almost always hot. This fan actually makes me cold after sitting with it blowing on me for about 10 minutes. It is pretty quiet too. Great fan, a must have!
 Very disappointed it has the worst burning plastic odor!!  Wheew got me sick !!! Don’t buy!!
 Fan is great for small areas. I have it in the corner of my kitchen so it's out of the way. I also bought one for upstairs guest room so the guest won't run the air conditioner so much. It's attactive and isn't noisy. Does the job
 nice circulation and great for white noise as well.
 Easy and quiet - remote works well.
 The fan has worked wonderful and the rotating mechanism is very quiet (bought it 8 months ago). Its pretty big (tall &amp; wide), so make sure you have the space for it.
 Blows air as described. Looks good.
 great product
 I love this fan-even my cousin wishes he had it!
 The fan works great.  The 2nd Lasky fan I've had. My only complaint is the remote is a little finicky.  I liked the old remote style better as ot worked from anywhere in the room.
 Broke after 2 months. Don't buy
 Great fan for a great price. Easy to assemble and the remote control is very convenient so you don't have to get up in the middle of the nighr to turn it off. Plus it does have a timer.
 This fan is a beast,  it is huge,  my wife got it for my birthday and I love it!!!!!!!!  Would have gave it 5 stars but the base seems a bit week for the big ass fan!  (love the remote)
 Good supplemental cooling! Sometimes can use without air-conditioning.  Like the size!
 Quiet. The fan really moves a lot of air. the remote is easy to use. The fan takes up very little space
 This fan is great! I live in the NW where none of us have air conditioning and it's been in the 90's. This fan is quite and does a great job cooling people off. Especially at night when you are trying to sleep.
 It is exactly as I thought it would be. it has good power and works by remote correctly
 Nice fan. Quiet
 Doesn't really blow hard nor cool air don't waste your money .
 Doing the job well... Still haven't turned on my AC in Illinois this summer....
 I love this fan. It is quiet and keeps me cool at night. Thinking of buying another one for my living room.
 This fan has good air flow output. The medium and low settings are quiet enough to leave running in the room to sleep. The remote works well and is very convenient.
 This is a beautiful and quiet tower fan that I keep in my office at work. It provides a wonderful amount of breeze and I really love it. I get lots of compliments from other saying it's the nicest fan they have ever seen.
 Love this fan! It is much quieter than my previous fan. Love that it has a remote. You cannot go wrong with this fan. It puts out more cool air than a noisy oscillating fan.
 This is a great fan. It puts out a ton of air and does it fairly quietly.<br/><br/>Only cons are:<br/><br/>Ion light is super bright at night. Fixed with small peice of electrical tape.<br/><br/>Wood grain is lighter than appears in the pic. Looks cherry,  it's not.<br/><br/>Still 5 stars.
 It is quiet and gives out cool air as advertised. It's a great buy for the summer.
 Great fan. Not a particularly strong airflow,  but the air does feel cooler. It is also quiet and looks nice.
 This fan is very quiet while on and has good air flow.
 Meh... I was expecting more after the glowing reviews.  Doesn't really put out much air.  I keep trying to turn it up, realizing that it is already on high.  I wouldn't purchase again but I already used it so I guess it's more trouble to return than it's worth.  I don't know what to recommend, but this is not very good... wish I had my $50 bucks back.
 Quiet and give you lots of air.
 Love this fan.
 Fan works great, only minor complaint is that if you sit really close to it, it doesn't send air towards to the floor so your legs don't feel the air.
 This is a great fan - has three different settings, oscillates, emits ions, et cetera. Our bedroom gets a bit warm in the summertime so we keep the fan on all night and it cools the room in no time without a lot of noise. The remote control is a plus too. Nice design and colors. Very reasonably priced.
 I put the fan together this week and started using it in my office at work.  It is lovely.  Very quiet and the remote works perfectly.  Very happy with this purchase.
 It feels very "plastically" but it blows good air.  Whether or not this ION thing does anything is difficult to tell.  A tad noisy.  But it does it's job.
 Love the fan. Only complaint is about the giant crack on the top of it where it looks like someone slammed it into something. Works great still.
 I've been through several fans. This is the best by far. Incredible value, works just as good if not better than comparable stand fans. Don't know how this isn't the top rated fan on Amazon.
 I trusted the other reviews when choosing this fan and glad I did.  This room measures 18 x 26 with 16' vaulted ceiling. Ceiling fan helps some but with another decent fan we can keep the thermostat 5 degrees higher and still be comfortable. Was using a 22" box fan which worked but was so loud I had to really crank up the TV or stereo to hear it, plus it was ugly!  This fan looks nice standing in a corner 15' behind our chairs.  It's quiet enough on low that I don't have to turn the TV volume up at all and the low setting works well here, creates a breeze from 15'.  And I didn't realize I'd use a remote for a fan but it's handy and works from 15' if your aim is good!  Assembly time was less than 5 minutes (6 screws). Everything is plastic and it's not rock solid but substantial enough.  If I needed another big fan I'd buy another one of these.
 had to cover the ION light with some electric tape because it was a little bright, but otherwise it's great
 we had been looking for a tower fan and decided to buy this one. we are extremely pleased with our purchase.
 I only buy Lasko. I have 2 mini towers that I have had for 10 years and they still work great. this tall fan is amazing. The features are great for the value.
 The best tower fan in my opinion. Easy to use, stylish, remote controllable, Ion settings to help clean the air, lightweight, and easy to maneuver. One of my favorite Amazon purchases.
 This fan has 3 speeds, and really moves the air in the room. Regardless of which speed you choose, the sound from the fan isn't distracting or loud enough to keep you awake. Honestly buy it........do it..........why are you still reading this.......you should have already purchased this........
 Fan works well, definitely not the quitest fan ever. But reason for the 3 stars is its not very durable! It got bumped into and fell over once, and now the buttons are pushed deep inside of the unit.
 I was surprised how nice the fan is.  I didn't realize it was also an ionizing unit.  It has a quiet hum that can probably be used as background sound for sleeping as well.
 I love this fan, I looked for a while and finally came down to this one. I don't believe that it is too loud I think it is perfect. would definitely  buy again.
 It blows, but not as much as I have experience with similar models
 It is fairly quiet even at higher settings. It can squeak a little as it turns from side to side. The controls are intuitive. It is pretty powerful and can push quiet a lot of air around and is the perfect height for several locations around the house. It's one of the few ways we got through the summer.
 Very nice fan. I give it a 4 star because it is a little bit wobbly if you touch it. I have 4 kids so wish I could find something more sturdy. Overall all I would recommend.
 Works great.
 We purchased 2 of these and one is great, the other the setting can only be on 2 now and this product is not even a yr old.  This is crazy!  And it is beyond Amazon taking it back! 😡
 I ORDERED 2 FOR FAMILY MEMBERS...BUT WHEN THEY ARRIVED THE BOXES WERE TORN UP AND RETAPED...WITHOUT OPENING THE BOX PRODUCT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS NEW FROM WHAT I CAN SEE...IF I FIND OUT PRODUCT IS DEFECTIVE OR NOT NEW I WILL REPOST...
 I have owned this fan for less than a year. Last night it just turned off and died. It won't turn back on. I have tried multiple outlets. It just stopped working. Unacceptable after so short a time period. Very disappointing. Do not buy.
 This lasted 2.5 months and will no longer run at all.<br/>This is a pile of junk. Do not waste money on this garbage
 Still works like a boss. Our apartment is very dusty (not for lack of cleaning, we just live on a very busy street) and this guy hasnt needed much in the way of cleaning. It still works great and we use it most of the year. Its been our favorite fan since it arrived. Remote is super handy!
 It gets the job done. In this heat wave this fan and my black out curtains are getting me to sleep.
 THIS THING IS THE ANSWER.  Gonna get another one as to appear like stereo speakers. It's hard to move air without making some noise but these things do it better than anything else I've come across.
 By far best fan &amp; quality I've owned! Plus has a few perks to make it look a bit classy!
 My daughter uses if at her college dorm, very quiet and efficient
 I like this new fan, is silence and efficient. Although my old Sharper image used to have a wider oscillation and softer remote control buttons, this one is a good replacement for it.
 Purchased this fan for my bedroom.  It is not powerful enough to put away from you so that you can feel the air.  You have to move the fan pretty close up to feel the air coming out.  In addition, when using the oscillation feature the fan makes a clicking noise when it gets to one side.  We have only had the fan a few months and it should not be doing this.  Its very annoying to be woken up by the clicking.  We have to use the oscillation feature in order to feel the air with out it not being right in your face.  I would not purchase this fan again.  I have written the company regarding the issue with the noise and will wait for their reply.
 The previous model lasted for almost 15 years.
 This is a great fan. Not very loud and provides a lot of cooling power. The only drawback in my opinion is that there is no way to take it apart for cleaning. I live in an old building that is VERY dusty and have a dog so no matter how much I try to wipe the outside, I have to replace mine at least once ever year, maybe two if I'm lucky.
 I already had problem when the fan was new. The fan has problem with power button. It’s very hard to turn the fan on. I had to press it many times to turn it on. I bought 2 of these and they both had problem with power buttons.
 Living in a apartment with no central air, I'm no stranger to sweat soup. I'll admit, I was slightly disappointed when I first plugged this thing in because it didn't seem all that great. However, I was right in front of it testing the flow, but it's just as strong 10 feet away and helps keep me in a goldilocks zone of just right! Buy this thing now and save yourself from the heat anguish that is summer.
 The box was damaged when i ordered however that should not mean product damage! The buttons on the fan doesn’t work and will only work w the remote. Their are pieces missing as well. Not satisfied!
 This fan looks great and is very quiet. Air flow is excellent and can be felt across an 18 foot room. The remote is a nice addition for ease of use.
 Bought one.  Tried it.  Liked it.  Ordered two more.  They work just as well as the first one.  Moves plenty of air and is remarkably quiet.  I wish the oscillation went farther than it does, as it is well less than 90 degrees.  Variable would be best and close to 180 degrees would be wonderful.  Otherwise it certainly does the job well.
 The remote is sad; it barely works. The fan is a little noisy, but not too bad in that department.
 Very quiet.
 have had one before, likey.
 Best fan ive ever owned.  Use it to circulate are from window AC and cools the whole floor!
 Use it in my office and I like that it is quiet and put out a lot of cool air.
 Love, love, love this fan.  It is quiet, moves the air great, and is very nice and modern looking. I would recommend this fan to anyone looking for a tower fan.  Great price, packed extremely well, arrived on time (even on Sunday!)  Very happy with this purchase.
 I like it so much that I'm buying another one for the other room.
 Great price. Much quieter than the last tower fan We had. Puts out lots of air. Very pleased
 Quiet, no bright lights which is perfect for the night. Much better than a more expensive Ozeri which I have in another room, it also cost less.
 I was not happy with this product, so I returned it.  Thank you Amazon for making that process pretty seamless.. although I was hoping to receive an Amazon credit, instead of reward points back on old (now defunct) credit card.. have to go sort that mess out separate.  :(<br/><br/>anyhow - the design is nice looking although it's a little dated and it won't fit with all decors - it has that fake wood paneling commonly found in lincoln towncars, plus the circle part on the front that says lasko was dented. Outputwise - in my opinion it's really ineffective.  I used it in a 12x15 living room, and then a 11x13 bedroom, and I honestly expected more for the price.  I bought the Lasko traditional 20" box fan instead, while much louder, it was about 75% more effective.  I could feel that fan immediately and there were honestly many many times I had to check on the other fan to see if it was still working, or try and reposition it because I was hot (did not have this problem at all with the straightforward functional little box fan) I don't think its worth the money or the hype.
 Was a gift and is used every day. Working great
 Had to ship back to Amazon.<br/>The time function kept turning on all by itself, resulting in the unit turning off. Super frustrating. Won't purchase a Lasko again. Going back to honeywell.
 Very disappointed with this. I've had it a month and even on the highest setting I barely get any wind. On the lowest setting it's like it's barely there. This fan had fantastic reviews but I have to say I'm extremely disappointed.
 This is the second fan that I have owned like this. The first I had for about 3 years. It did not wear-out or malfunction. I had to move and had no room to take it with me on my cross country move and gave it to a friend.
 Love it! Have been using this fan for months and it does it's job well. We have used it thru out our home from kitchen to bedroom to great room. Love the remote control.
 Great fan. Only complaint is about the remote. You have to be pretty close to the fan and have the remote pointing directly at it for it to have any chance of working. Does a great job keeping bedroom cool.
 Just doesn't feel very strong.<br/><br/>There's also no memory in this thing. Want it to always rotate? Well, each time you turn it on you have to press the rotate button. Etc.
 Works great
 not enough air-----doesn't rotate far enough
 Have this fan in my office, works great, very quiet. Remote is a nice feature. It is fairly large but stable and attractive.
 I loved this fan  but I put it in a smaller  room, and bought a little larger one  for what I  needed it for.  Its in storage right now just in case  my larger one  gives up on me.  I will never buy another  round  fan again this is the way to go it takes up less room.
 Best fan!
 Nice cooling!
 Good looking product, remote works well, options are good.<br/><br/>Mine had an issue where it began smelling like burning plastic or rubber after a couple hours of use.  It became too much and I had to return it.
 I use this in NYC because my apartment does not have Central AC and I refuse to buy an AC unit for 2 months of so called Summer in NYC. Don't get me wrong here, Summer gets pretty hot up here but being from Miami, I am used to it. I thought a good fan could do the trick and so far It has.
 The fan is great, but the two of the controls on the fan were indented in the top and cannot operate the fan. I was unable to return it. It works perfectly with the remote.
 I have a roughly 8x 10 office with a window that becomes incredibly hot during a Houston summer.  My previous attempts with fans were frustrating because they would drown out the conversation I was having with the person in the office.  With this fan I haven't had to call maintenance to complain about the heat and I can easily hear somebody speaking. My fan is about a foot from my door; it is not uncommon for somebody to stick their head in to ask me a question and then to comment on the fan and how quiet it is.  I couldn't be happier with it
 My son likes it. Kept him cool all summer. Remote control was a plus. Space saver,  slick look, and great price. I would buy this item again if we need one.<br/>😊 Happy customer!😊
 After 2 days fan started clicking every round - not loud, but annoying. In terms of CFM - not so much.
 pretty expensive for a fan but it does look nice. Ionizing whatever doesn't do anything.
 We love this fan! It's quiet but powerful. We use it upstairs to help move the air and assist our window air conditioner. We can use the remote from across the room while relaxing in the recliner.  We highly  recommend this fan.
 Love love love this fan! This is probably the best tower fan I have purchased. The ionizer on this fan is a HUGE plus....I tend to have really bad allergies and I have definitely noticed a difference since having it run in my bedroom. If you like to have white noise at night time, this would be the fan for you...I find that it has the perfect level. If you are light sensitive though, I will say that the blue Ionizer light is bright...it doesn't bother me at all, but if you are light sensitive it might.
 great product and works to keep me cool
 Works perfect for when I am sleeping at night and bought it also for the remote option. I’ve had the fan though for about 2 weeks and the buttons on the top of the fan itself have already stopped working?  Still works with remote so I am still okay with it.
 so about a week of having this fan and I barely use it. It decided to stop working it won't isolate anymore so now Im stuck great. And no way to contact anyone about this issue
 Replaced a box fan with this. It's much quieter ,but it doesn't push as much air, which I expected after reading the reviews. Works well, the remote is great and love the time.  Form factor fits well in tight spots.
 Cooled down a stuffy office wonderfully!
 Works great.
 Love this fan! People think I have an air conditioner in the room I use it in!
 Very, very quiet. Moves lots of air for a fan of this size. We like it very much.
 I purchased the Lasko 2551 fan on December 17/15. It has stopped working today and it's February 15/16, so not quite two months. Apparently I cannot return this item to the Warehouse seller or Amazon. Expensive fan $60.00. $30.00 per month. Considering we have had cool weather here in Florida it had very little use.
 Barely any noise. Fan speed is what I expected. Easy to use. Easy to assemble. Very pleased with my purchase.
 Very very weak fan!  We could not tell much difference at all from the lowest to highness setting.  I am returning
 Great price and functionality! This product uses a remote, turns from side to side, and ionizes the air. There is also a timer, adjustments for speed and direction, and looks sleek. Good job!
 This is my third fan in the last 10 plus years.  I find I use it all seasons.  That is probably why I have had so many of them.  After one burns out I just order another.  They will only last 3 to 4 years of continual use.
 We like its air speed, rotation reach, and options. It works well for cooling the living room when we have a lot of guests. I thought a remote for a fan was really stupid until we started using it, and it's really quite helpful for making quick adjustments for everyone's comfort without having to climb over legs and drinks.
 Love the whisper quiet and the powerful air circulation
 It is much bulkier than it looks on the website, and not very sturdy.  Also we had to return it because of a terrible smell coming from it.  We tried different setting, but still a chemical nasty smell.
 It works as expected.  I assembled it with the help of my 8 year old.  Love the look of it.
 It does what I needed-- circulate air.  I would consider this a 'booster' to your climate control, not a high volume air producer. It blends well in the corner against the leather chair and quietly and smoothly moves air through the room.  Which is what I wanted.... But, if you Are looking for the type of fan the dog lays in front of with his paws in the air to cool down, this isn't it.  Dog still goes to lay in front of the bedroom fan.
 Tower of power. Cools a wide area quickly &amp; efficiently but also adept at spot cooling along a bedside etc. Not silent, but softer sound than typical circular fan. Remote works quite well from varying distance. Timer up to 7.5 hours. Easy assmbly of bade only required.
 Quiet and moves a lot of air. I liked it so much I bought another
 Bought the fan on June 6th 2018 and it just died on October 10th. It just stopped working.
 Great fan.
 Very nice fan.  Looks nice.  Not a high, high wind coming out, but is nice and quiet.
 We bought this to replace an old fan with a large round head and very wide base.  The look of this is really great and it's so much easier to store.  It's a tiny bit louder than I thought it would be, but the sound really isn't bothersome.  It would be cool if Lasko could put wheels on the base so you could tip it back and roll it when you want to move it.
 This is a really good fan. Great to look at also. Works just right.
 Love this fan.  Sturdy, quiet and sharp looking!
 Very easy to set up and to use. Quiet and does the job. The hardest thing to do is to plug unit into the wall.
 This fan is tall with a small footprint. It runs quietly on all speeds and moves a lot of air. I like the ionizer feature. Though it seems a little expensive, I think it's worth the price because of its size and quiet workings. I would buy another one.
 This is exactly what I was looking for. It's tall and thin and quiet.<br/>I seem to always need a fan blowing on me and usually have ceiling fans, but in my current apartment, don't have any. I am able to position this against a wall between two rooms and have fresh air circulating in both. And it's light enough that I can move it easily if I want.<br/><br/>The oscillator only moves about 45 degrees, but that works for me. Because it's so tall, it seems to be moving a lot of air.<br/><br/>It has three speed settings; I've only needed the lowest setting. Will probably crank it up once summer comes along,<br/><br/>I can't tell how well the ionizer works yet, we'll see when it's time to clean the vents.<br/><br/>Since it is so light weight, it's not terribly sturdy ... might not do so well with small children. It could easily be knocked over in the position I have it, but would be more secure in a corner.<br/><br/>The remote is kind of cool, but not necessary for me.
 This is a pretty quote fan but I love it
 I bought this fan to help cool our two upstairs bedrooms (which ROAST during the summer). I added dark panels to the windows to keep out the light. Adding these fans allowed us to set the thermostat higher (as it is always cooler downstairs), which will save on our electricity bill. I was able to set the thermostat 4 degrees warmer without feeling the difference upstairs. Reasonably quiet and not overpowering, so a nice addition to the home office as well.
 Bought it as a gift. Recipient totally appreciated it and loves how it works.
 Ordered this for my mom her old one broke she had it for years hope to get the same from this one.
 I like the way the fan distributes air. I think it's better than a propeller fan. If I had a bigger place I would get 1 more. The blue light does not bother me. The sound is more relaxing for me as well.
 Died pretty soon, power button stopped working :(
 Happy with this purchase! However, the blue light that comes on when you press the "ION" setting is very bright, especially when you're trying to sleep at night.
 doesn't have a flimsy base and worked perfectly out of the box.  No squeaks, grinds, smell, nothing.  Base is only 2 pieces with thumbscrews.  Nothing snaps (no tabs to snap), but rather can be taken down easily if you need to return.  Remote has full functions, but needs to be pointed directly at the black plastic atop the fan.  Doesn't come with 2xAAA.  Can slightly adjust air angle up or down.  Oscillates 45 degrees, so fairly narrow unless further away, but my other one is 90 degrees and seems too wide unless very close to me.  Very solid and quiet.
 Absolutely great product. Ran almost all night and all day in summers. Never a problem. Not much vibration. Sturdy base and build. Everything is just good about it. No problems whatsoever. Nice buy. I love the humming this or any other fan produces. Gets me a good night sleep.
 Love this fan! Works well and the remote is so efficient. The tall shape is very easy to find a place for in a room and seems to work much better than the old round 'stand up' fans. This is our second fan of this type and may be getting a third!
 Needed an extra fan to help the circulation in my apartment as it can get a little stuffy. It arrived on time and well packaged. I use it both in the bedroom and living room. In the bedroom i usually have the AC running and turn it off at night with just the  fan on. it works well. In the living room, depending on how hot it is, the temperature of the air circulating can vary. Over all good fan
 Just opened this today after getting it for Christmas.  It was shipped int he original box and the power and fan buttons were both pushed into the machine so it doesn't work. Missed the return date by 3 days :/
 Was watching a hockey game at a friends house on a Sunday afternoon. They had the curve fan and I thought it was great. So I went on google to check out the price. I found it for less then $63 via amazon market place and ordered it right there from my phone. The fan was delivered and on my porch before I left for work the following Tuesday. How awesome is that! Happy with the fan, extremely happy with the quick delivery and convinience / ease of ordering. The fan was provided by The Nerds, and I will do business with them again and recommend them highly. Thanks guys!
 Louder than I was led to believe. I have to turn up my TV by 5 volume notches to hear it over the fan on its lowest setting. It is still a good fan though. I would give it 5 stars if I wasn't led to believe it was supposed to be quiet.
 This fan broke the first week I got it. They want me to send this big awkward thing back nah uh not happening. It blows cold air and I've somewhat gotten used to the annoying cracking noise it makes at night while I try to sleep.
 Best choice!
 I love this fan! it runs very quiet and cools my small room very well. The remote control feature is very useful from bed. It was very easy to use right out of the packaging and packed well.
 This is a good and attractive fan. We bought it to use in the bedroom, but most of the air is just too low for a modern high mattress bed.  So, we moved this fan to the living room where it does a great job out of the way in a corner.  If you're looking for a fan for the bedroom, I'd recommend this one: <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/FAN-PEDESTAL-52/dp/B001V981E6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">FAN,PEDESTAL,52"</a>
 I am very satisfied with this fan to date.  I did not give it 5 stars only because I have not been using it very long and don't know how well it will stand up!  So far so good!
 This fan was great for about 2 weeks until it started making a loud noise. I love that it has an ionizer, everything else is fine but I don't even use it now due to the noise.
 just what I needed.  when I get hot, I turn it on and my husband can have the A/C higher and not complain!!
 I was worried that it wouldn't move sufficient air, but luckily my worries were unfounded!  Fits into a narrow area and works beautifully!
 Oh My Goodness I love this fan!! I wouldn't say it's whisper quiet but it's better than the fan i had but what i LOVE is, it REALLY REALLY keeps the room cool!! I mean really really!! I love Love Love it!!
 This fan is awesome.  The best thing about it is how quiet it is.  Great velocity too.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this for your home.
 I've had this fan for less than a year and it stopped working.  What's worse is that there are 2 triangular screws that are impossible to unscrew so you cannot take the fan apart to clean or repair.  This was a complete waste of $60.
 Gets the job done
 It’s ok
 Although this fan did not blow a "tornado" it did cover a wide area both horizontally and vertically. In addition, the ionizer did make a noticeable difference to those with breathing difficulties. Good value for the price (and free shipping).
 I purchased this fan for my daughters room and couldn't be happier. She loves it and the remote control is great for her bunk bed. Other posts stated this fan was loud and the power light was like a beacon in the dark. Neither of these are accurate. My daughter sleeps with her door closed and the power light is barely noticeable. I like it so much I will be purchasing another one.
 Love this fan. It is very effective and was larger than I thought it would be.
 High speed isnt really that powerful &amp; it is a bit louder than expected since it's advertised as "quiet".
 Great to have in a room would ceiling fan.
 This is a good cooling fan, not as quiet as someone made out to be, but more quiet than a regular fan.<br/>This fan does a good  job of cooling my room.
 A great fan with a cool ionizing feature. My only complaint is it’s range of motion, it covers maybe a 50-60 degree range compared to my cascade 40” 60-70
 Bought 1 for myself. This fan work really good. Not really noisy. And this guy is tall.<br/> And my roommate wanted it. So i bought another one for him.
 great fan.  quite. works well.  the ionizer doesn't seem to do much.
 Loved it so much after buying the first one, that I bought two more!!! Super quiet, powerful, and I love that it has a remote as well.
 I own a Honeywell but it leaned so I ordered this one. It is sturdier. Both provide cool air and turn and purify air. Looking forward to savings on electricity bill. It came at right time. Temperature has been record breaking this week 99 degrees at end of July. August is usually hotter in Louisiana. I'm so Blessed to have this fan!!! Very attractive!!! It's one of those things I don't know how I lived without it. I have one in bedroom and one in living in addition to ceiling fans. Air purifier a bonus!!!!! Lasso model very sturdy. Easy to put together. For me that's saying a lot. I can feel it so strong right now and it's probably 7 feet from me. The Honeywell in my bedroom is at the base of my bed and I can feel it. It took months before I knew it could turn and purify air. I love it even more. It's one of my favorite things!!!!!
 Still going strong after 3 years. Blows a good amount of air.
 Excellent fan.<br/>Whisper quiet on virtually all settings.  Contains a remote which works but I never use.<br/>Also, quite attractive.<br/><br/>Sits permanently in our kitchen and is on most of the summer.
 Very quiet. Also pretty stable on the floor. Take away one star as I wish it would oscillate wider than 90 degrees.
 Received my Fan yesterday!  Love it and was very easy to assemble base.  Perfect for my room and very quiet. Remote needs 2 x AAA batteries, so be prepared.
 I highly recommend this for anyone and everyone, throw your old fans out! Awesome Air Flow!
 Love it! Great power and quality.
 I'm very disappointed that my fan arrived without any screws to attached the fan to the base! I now have to run to the store to buy the screws separately that I found in the instructions - that say the screws are included.
 Works as intended.
 We've had this for about 2 months. Works great.  I end up getting cold on high setting though. This fan makes a big difference when the temperature is 90+ outside.
 Airflow is not as expected at high speed.
 Works well keeps my living  room cool.
 We received our first fan and ordered a second one.  It gets the job done and works well.  It really cools the room down quickly.  It just feels a little unstable or not sturdy enough.  It wobbles a little.  I wish it were sturdier. Then I would give it 5 stars.  I'm not convinced it will last a real long time.  Time will tell.
 I  got this fan a month ago. The bedroom in our upstairs always gets hotter at night than I prefer, I love to sleep in the cold. This fan is great for sleeping as it is quiet, has a timer, and keeps the air in the room moving. It comes with an "Ionizer" that some people say makes the air colder, but I haven't noticed a difference in the air quality or temperature in the room. I like the height of this fan as it is tall enough to reach me on my bed, some of the other tower fans are not quite tall enough to make it over the mattress. The only reason why I have given this fan 4 stars is that since my purchase, I have found some other tower fans that are equally as quiet and are $20 cheaper. If you are looking for a cheaper fan, you might want to look at Costco if you have one. Otherwise, this fan does what it promises to do, blows air quietly so that's a plus.
 great fan work's well thank's.
 My wife uses this.  She loves it.
 This fan is very powerful and fits great in the corner of a room. it has many settings to help my office stay cool!
 My older Lasko swiveled on a wider arc back and forth and blew more air. But this one looks nicer and does a good job of moving air. Arrived quickly and came in original box, no extra packing. UPS must have been careful with it.
 WE BROUGHT THIS LASKO WIND FAN TO USE WHEN IT GETS TOO HOT.  IT IS QUIET AND VERY EFFICIENT. HAS AN IONIZER AND OSCILLATING FAN.  IT IS STURDY AND TALL. SO FAR HAVE ONLY USED THE FIRST SETTING AND WE ARE COMFORTABLY COOL.<br/>WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
 Wonderful fan!! Sad we didn’t get it earlier in the summer. Works wonders at keeping our entire living room cool, and the design is sleek &amp; versatile enough to fit with any room decor.
 Terrific fan good purchase good price, good looking fan.
 This has been the worst year for HUMIDITY in L. A. This fan has made all the difference. Keeps me cool in one room. Save on A. C. bill but most importantly kills the HUMIDITY.
 After a day of use the fan started making a semi loud rattling noise. First night of use I thought the fan worked perfect. I liked the airflow and appearance of it as well. However, the rattling noise was too disturbing to me when I used it at night while I slept. Decided to return the fan for a full refund.
 Amazing, this is my second one, and I LOVE IT!!!!! It is better than the original one I had for near 6 years.
 I bought this for my office and everyone steals it!  Really like the motion, the foot print and the remote.  Would def buy again.
 It's much taller than I anticipated but I think it's a great product for the price. Works well, looks stylish. Arrived fast.
 Great fan but was supposed to receive in 2 days and didn't happen.  In addition, a piece is broken so it doesn't oscillate properly.  This is the second one I have ordered and had no issues first time around
 Works great and didn't break the bank.
 Not as good as I expected.  Air from it is not cool.  But works.
 Great for every room. I definitely will be purchasing another.
 I simply love this fan ! No spacious size or noise. I don't like open cool air conditioner in summer cause it will make me feel dry next morning. The fan just brings calm and cool breeze for an entire summer in my bedroom last year~
 We just received ours yesterday and my husband loves it. it keeps the room very cold and it is not noisy. The LED light is bright but sticking some black tape of the light does the trick. I am ordering another one.
 Fan makes an incredibly annoying grinding sound as soon as it starts. If you lift the top of the fan the noise goes away, it sounds like a tolerance problem with some plastic parts or a bearing rubbing. I guess this is just the quality control you can expect for the price.
 Gift for a college dorm room.  Works perfect . . . space saving but does a great job of circulating the air.
 Not too much speed.
 Works great. Nice to have remote.
 works like a charm and better than the original models. the buttons are silent, the machine is powerful, and is decent in value.<br/><br/>this is my second time buying this product and i would gladly buy it a third time if need be.
 Very quite fan, I thought it came with batteries, had to get batteries.  Well made, was worried my cats would topple the fan, it has a large base, and I have carpet, does not budge.  Overall, pretty pleased with the fan.
 It's perfect for any PC gamer in their gaming corner. After long hours of gaming your office will get really hot and this has been exactly what I needed.
 I have not used this fan as of yet.  I have the same model that I purchased probably over 10 years ago.  I keep thinking is is going to give out soon but it never does.  This is a great fan for sure.
 Worked great the first day! Only used it for two hours the first night but when I set the timer for 2 hours the next night... It never turned off.  I still use it but have to unplug it every time because I'm afraid if i exchange it for a new one I'll end up with a fan that won't turn on..
 My room gets very hot in the summertime (poor insulation) and I was using a desk fan for the longest time. I finally got tired of waking up and feeling like I was gonna die and bought a tower fan. This one is definitely a winner.
 Great fan for those summer nights (when even the A/C set at 72 degrees doesn't help the upstairs bedroom).
 Great product
 Not happy at all with the fan. It's not powerful at all. Would not recommend for someone who needs to stay cool
 Not as powerful as I would like, does great in our kids room but not in our family room.
 Decent tower fan. Decent price. I was expecting slightly more power. Basic assembly required to put fan on stand/base. Super simple. Overall happy with purchase
 Love this  fan!!! Family fights over it! Cools the whole room
 It looks amazing. The faux wood trim gives it a match to my wood floors that I couldn't find with any other fan. It works as advertised. It's a fan. It blows air out. That's all I expected it to do. Bought it primarily for the looks since my old fan was a regular fan with circular blades that looked horrible.
 We bought this on a Wednesday and it shipped Prime once we saw our camping weekend was going to be 100 degree weekend!<br/><br/>We put the fan in the corner and had it oscillate...it was perfect! It was quiet and it helped us survive the camping weekend!
 Excellent fan -- especially the timer.  We fall asleep much calmer and cooler now.  Silent, clean, efficient fan.  Really loved this.
 Works as described.  I move it from room to room with no problem.
 The fan is heavy and its not that effective for a living room area and is more effective in small room when placed closely. The fan speed at level 3 is also little slow as compared to other fans at the same price level and some times may throw up a warmer air. I would recommend either some thing little cheap or if spending this much money than look for other brands.
 bought 2, one does not oscillate , the other the remote does not work, fairly quiet, good air movement.
 My nephew who lives in NYC, requested this as a wedding gift.  He is thrilled and uses it constantly!  Very pleased.
 First stand up fan I have ever purchased. The remote makes use easier and the strength of the fan is superior to most fans. I can leave this fan on low when I leave for work in the morning and can come to a cool room during the summer days. Good investment for an office!
 This fan works great, it's not too loud but perfect for blocking out some noise and great to fall asleep to. I love the ionizer feature!
 awesome!
 Great value for a high quality fan. Using this instead of a ceiling fan.
 The fan is really easy to assemble. It’s quieter than most, and it nice that it has a timer for those times you just want it on for awhile and get too sleepy to get up and turn it off. The remote is just a bonus!
 The motor is so loud. The fan works correctly except for the fact that the motor sounds like swarming bees. It's almost basically useless because of the noise.
 Powerful but quiet fan that has been a lifesaver during this hot spell.
 Awesome power for my daughters bedroom on West side of house in Arizona. Difficult for her to stay cool in 118 degree weather.. this fan helps emmensely.
 Great fan!  Produces a lot of air, not too noisy, would definitely buy again!
 Such a useless purchase this was. Fan doesn't blow any air. We bought 4 fanns of the sam brand and this is was the only different model we bought and it turned out to be disaster and waste of money. Rest of the 3 Lasko fans are just wonderful but disappointed with this one.
 Nice unit for my bedroom. Quiet and has three speeds and an oscillation setting. Tower fans are better than traditional  oscillating fans because they are not top heavy, so the oscillation feature doesn't suffer from the effects of time and gravity.
 I purchased this item as a gift for my son, he loves it.  He says it is quiet and efficient.  Does a wonderful job of cooling the area.  He likes the sleek lines of the fan and the looks of the fan.  He is very impressed with it.  I would not hesitate to recommend this item to anyone.
 I just purchased 3 of these for my store after my energy bills went through the roof, in an effort to save money. These fans are HUGE, and they put out a TON of Cool air. So far, I'm very happy with my purchase.
 I use a fan every night and this one is perfect. It looks great, not too loud and has lots of options for comfort. I searched Amazon and read reviews on many fans before I choose this one and I am very Happy.
 As expected
 I have 4
 It hardly blows any air!! Extremely disappointed! Will definitely return.
 It's quiet enough that it doesn't disturb anyone, but just loud enough to provide the right amount of white noise for me to sleep soundly.
 Much easier to sleep in my warmer upstairs bedroom now.
 Silent, elegant, and compact, it cools very well and the ion function removed odors so I am very happy with this buy. The only thing I don't like is the base is a bit flimsy for such a tall fan and if you have kids or dogs it could be knocked over quite easily/frequently.
 Easy assembly great height with extender.<br/>Light shines on ceiling I cover to give complete darkness<br/>Sound still you can hear it but much better than what I had<br/>Cooling factor 75% still nothing compared to an air conditioner but who has the money for that so yes this work as an alternative !
 Live in LA with no ac in the house but we get a nice cross breeze. I have a 15 mo old and worried about her with the nanny during the day. So far so good. Fine enlightened quality.<br/><br/>Got this style of fan because my daughter can stick her fingers in it and it's totally child proof.
 Nice fan, works well and easy to put-together.  Parts fit nicely and look good.  Runs quiet, remote works well.  No issues, very happy.
 Really helps keep my living room cooler since it doesn't have a ceiling fan and very quiet. Love it! A lot bigger and taller than I expected though.
 Unit appears sturdy and reliable. Air volume could be higher and noise could be somewhat lower. Noise, even on low setting, is somewhat distracting in bedroom at night. Overall, unit is a good buy for general room cooling.
 Worked fine for a year then a month or two after the year mark, it stop oscillating properly.  Only does it sometimes but still blows good air..powerful and sleek looking
 I love the fan and its nice that it has a built in ionizer. I wish the remote had backlighting but every thing else is great. Nice wood finish
 GREAT product
 Fan has a smell coming from it that is similar to electric motor failure or rubber making contact with a moving part.  Cannot seem to determine location of issue, but this was immediately noticed once assembled and operated.  Have used the fan less then 30 mins.  Opting to return this fan.
 Esthetically pleasing however the blower is weak.
 I ordered two of these!!! Love, love, love them! Great fan with a lot of cooling power!!!!
 Lots of air flow and very quiet. Highly recommended.
 After unboxing and setting it up there is immediately a rattling internal component. This is the issue I was replacing my last fan for. Very displeased and intend to return. Such an inconvenience.
 Works great! Nice and quiet.
 well made
 Excellent room fan
 I bought 2 of these fans and they replaced the bulky round fan that was always in the way. They are compact and easy to place in a corner for full coverage of the rooms they are in. The remote control makes it easy to control what fan speed I want as well as turning it on and off. The ION option allows for cleaner/dust free are flow. They are ideal for both small rooms as well as large rooms. I am enjoying them both emensley.
 Ok,  it works well. However, a remote is useless if you have to stand 2 feet away for it to work. I can press the buttons at that point. I called and they said they would send a replacement as a "one time courtesy"! Really?<br/>Well,  I got the new remote, SAME PROBLEM. 2 STARS<br/>And definitely not for a bedroom, oh well.
 Its OK. The blowing power is pretty weak and if you use it on a hot day, it will actually make it worse.
 This is a best selling product, but I wouldn't have guessed had I just picked it from my top choices.  It doesn't have a high quality feel, it isn't particularly quiet, mine was missing 8 of the screws to attach the baseboard (I bought some at a hardware store - M5 thread, 1/2" long).  The remote works really well, it is the right height for my Wife and I to get fanned by it on our crate-raised bed. Really it just doesn't feel or sound like it's going to last 5 years - it's probably a 3 year fan with regular usage and moving around the house...<br/>Finally I should mention that the ionizing air purifying I believe is supposed to come with a warning label. Do some of your own research and decide if you'll use it or not.  But as I understand it, it produces O-Zone (O3), which is poisonous to us; and ultimately instead of using ionizing air filtration everywhere (like it started back in 2005), we're basically back to HEPA air filtration and purification.  So certainly don't buy the fan for that reason.<br/>I'm pretty sure there's better tower fans out there, I think this is just the fan that's been up here the longest.
 Works well.
 Great fan! but it is BIG! Way larger than I had initially thought but I love how quiet it is and the air-flow it gives out. Mind you, I like a little bit of white noise so the fan is not completely silent. Other oscillating fans I have had (mainly cheaper ones) in addition to the noise of the fan, the oscillating motion made a noise. This Lasko fan does not do that at all. I live in Texas and do not have a ceiling fan in my apartment living room so this is great to move air around. The remote is convenient though the line of sight has to be pretty spot on for it to work.<br/><br/>Seriously, I am a fan fanatic and this is the first one I have been truly happy with. If I move to a larger place I will most certainly be buying another.
 My house is cooled to a temp that suits my family but I get really hot in the summers. It's a terribly hot summer in MD and I'm pregnant so this summer is particularly unbearable for me. Solution: a fan! I decided on this fan because of the reviews and I am pleased with the purchase. This fan looks good and even though I have only had it a few days, it meets all my needs. It sits across the room from where I sit to watch TV and it reaches me. The "hum" does get loader depending on the fan setting but this is to be expected. The remote is the clincher - considering how often I have turned it on/off and changed the fan speed, it would have been a nightmare to stand up each time and walk over to the tower. I have not used the ionizer so no comment. All in all, provided it lasts, it has met my expectations. I can now confidently buy another one for the bedroom.
 I like the fan..works well.!
 My hubby and I live in AZ and this fan is AMAZING! We wanted a powerful fan that we could use when it is cool enough at night to where we do not need to have the AC on and this fan does the trick! The wind power is amazing and it cools the rooms down really well! Great buy! Will be getting more!
 Love this fan! Quiet, but very powerful with a stylish design. I would definitely recommend.
 The power of the fan is not as what I expected, but in return, you get a nice quiet fan that pushes air very well.  The only thing that I'm not confident about is the base- it seems very flimsy and can break at a moments notice.  They could have added a few more screws perhaps to lock it down tightly, but to me, all it would take is for someone to knock it over and it would break right off.<br/><br/>I like the fact that it has an Ionizer and remote control (instructions imply to put the batteries in, but does not indicate in writing that batteries are not included- only stated on outside of box).  It also have a timer for up to 8hrs of use before shutting-down and 180 degree rotation side to side is a plus as well.<br/><br/>This design though is far more better than the ones with a long-neck between the base and the unit.  My older Lasko fan which I bought from Walmart broke after it fell over and ripped apart the screws from the plastic.  The fan still works but the neck needs to be replace- hard to find replacement parts for it as well, unless you want to spend the time gluing the plastic pieces back together.<br/><br/>Just be careful to put it in a place where it won't be disturbed by a lot of foot traffic and you'll be ok.
 Works great.  Easy to assemble.
 Purchased one for me and my mom. Cools in hot summer weather. Feels like a small AC
 This is a great indoor fan. Not too loud and doesn't take up as much space as a window fan. My favorite is the oscillation option, during the summer it provides a nice breeze without blowing all of your papers away! I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is a bit of an eyesore, but I prefer it to be taller, rather than wider.
 Cool!!!!!
 Small footprint, but tall. I like the remote feature. I noticed other reviewers report the air from this fan feels"cooler" than other fans, and it found this to be true, too.  Oscillating feature is a plus. Fairly quiet operation. Glad I purchased this.
 I wasn't sure what to expect - but during a heat wave in the Pacific Northwest, every store ran out of fans.  We looked and looked and finally I decided the best case scenario was to ORDER ONE ONLINE!  I went online to Amazon initially, then just couldn't decide which one to buy.  I went to a competitor's web site and clicked on fans and searched by highest rated and came across this one.  I decided to plug the name into Amazon and search, located it and had it shipped on 1-day shipping.  It arrived before noon (less than 24 hours after purchase) and I opened it immediately, put it together and I have been SO HAPPY ever since!  It's got a stronger based than another stick fan we're currently borrowing - so no shaking when it spins.  Also, there's a super-convenient remote control (batteries NOT included!) that works like a charm.  So far, so AWESOME!  Thanks Lasko!
 This fan provides the airflow to keep me cool in my home office. I find it is relatively quiet.  Great product. I've been using for about a month now and I have no complaints.
 Love this fan. Have had it for over a year and not one issue. Recommend
 Quiet and it looks great.  Powerful enough for my bedroom.
 This one casts a strong breeze. I want to replace all my fans with this type because they're quiet and work very well. But I think I'd get a less-severe one for the bedroom, something a little smaller, this one would probably blow me out of bed.
 The cool air flow is very soothing and refreshing for hot summer days and nights when you are sleeping.
 A little noisier than we would like, and the range of motion (left to right) is oddly limited. We aren't unhappy because it does work and looks good, but we'll likely try another product next time.
 Great fan with lots of power. Can push air either up or down. The swivel works great. Only bad thing I can point out is the display light it too bright.
 great fan
 Good quality, quiet, love remote
 great stream of cool air when turned on. very easy to assemble. great product for the price! very attractive design, yet to find any faults in it.
 Excellent fan.  This will be the one I buy again if another one of my old fans bite the dust.  Reviews were spot on.
 No complains, it’s been so good for now no troubles. I bought used and it has come out great.<br/><br/>But if your looking for something to cool off your room this is not what your looking for.
 I don't know why anyone would complain about this fan!<br/>It was delivered on time, it rotates, and has a remote control and super easy to use. It circulates the air very quickly and is not too big or awkward to place in a room.<br/>I have allergies and asthma and with this in the room i can breathe easier.<br/>The only thing remotely negative i could say is that it is a little top-heavy but it doesn't fall over or anything like that.<br/>It produces sufficient amount of air blowing across  a med-large room and keeps me cool.<br/>It's easy to carry from room to room ( or you could just buy more than one). I usually work out of the same room in my house so I normally don't even need to move it around. I'm not sure why people are exaggerating about the little blue light, It does not light up the whole room, and guess what, you can put tape over it if it's that much of a problem for you.<br/><br/>It is perfect for what i need and i couldn't be happier. :)
 Bought this in the winter and now use it everyday in the summer.  Powerful even on the lowest setting.  Takes care of a rather large area without being too loud.
 Best fan I have ever had!!
 It’s ok. Puts off cold air, not great flow though, even on high. Love that it is quiet though.
 This is not as powerful as I would have liked it to have been. I live in a small apartment in the bay area which doesn't exactly have extreme heat but this thing has trouble keeping my cool on really hot days. Also the base is pretty flimsy and it is prone to falling over.
 Used this to replace and older model same brand. Noticeably louder than the older model so I gave the new fan to my colleague and I kept the older fan.
 This fan doesn't blow as well as other fans.. I was disappointed, but am still using it.. Easy to put together, but there are definatley better fans like this out there.  But price was reasonable.
 The whole unit wobbles a lot, the fan blows ok amount of air. It's an ok fan
 Excellent product  We have a long narrow living room 12' x 32' and it quietly cools this room in no time. I'm very impressed I want 36"' ones  now for 2 of our bedrooms.
 Very unsatisfied, missing remote, missing 2 of the 4 screws that were also suppose to be included in package. But im sure they fell out since someone must have thrown in into a wood chipper before shipment? Im honestly at a lost of words.
 I got this for my bedroom &amp; it’s just a little loud for my liking but it works well
 I leave the ionzer off because the blue light is way to bright to sleep with.  It's quiet, but I wish it were a stronger fan.
 I guess its just that i love the idea it take up so little space, and the fan is sooooo quiet and still blows really really well.
 This fan is really nice! Great for medium to large rooms. It blows a good amount of air, and isn't too loud, but I like to hear my fans especially when I sleep. It has a great remote, and the air ionizer works pretty well too to keep the air fresh, which can be turned on or off. Really nice quality fan.
 Live in Florida....this fan helps keep air conditioner usage at minimum!  Love it.  Ned to know how to replace filter
 After only a few usages it has stopped working. Bad product. I do not recommend it, bad experience.
 The base was easy to assemble. It is quiet and I really like the oscillation &amp; ionization. It moves the air better than my box fan does and it is cooler.
 Works great, quiet
 Kinda loud
 Wonderful! So much better than small fan blowing in my face.
 Works good until now
 Purchased this tower fan for the living room and it does a great job of moving air.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- Not too loud<br/>- Moves a good amount of air<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- Remote has a small sweet spot to connect with<br/>- Could blow a little more air in my opinion
 Best fan ever!  I am so glad I bought this fan.  If you get this fan you will not regret it.  I give it 10 stars!!!!
 ABSOLUTELY the best fan I've ever bought.  It's quiet!!  It takes up little space but puts out lots of air.  Love the ionization feature as well.  Will never go back to a traditional fan.
 Quit working after 2 years, remote quit after a year .nice when it worked.
 I purchased this fan on July 20th, 2017, it has stopped working. I have an older one that continues to work, perhaps this fan is defective. Based on the minimal usage, I don't suggest purchasing this item.
 I bought this item for my granddaughter's room. She loves it &amp; says it works very well. Children are hard to please. When you buy something they are happy with, well you're doing something right. A good product to consider to buy.
 Could use a few more fan speed settings and be a bit quieter but overall a very nice fan. It feel sturdy and the remote is very handy.
 Wish the remote didn’t fall of its roost so easily! I like that it can be picked up easily and taken to another room!<br/>We primarily use it in the living room!
 Met my expectations. I love it
 Large, quiet, moves lots of air, and is a decent looking fan. Blue "ION" light is way too bright to leave on during the evenings if this is in your bedroom, but it's easy enough to turn off via the remote. All-in-all a solid product.
 This fan is very quiet. It is the best tower fan i have ever had.
 Received the product in time. However i see that the product has cracked near the bottom screw that extends to the base plate. I was expecting a better quality product. I will be reaching out for a replacement. I shall update this review once i receive the replacement.
 i have this fan on all of the time, even with the whole house air.  keeps ME cool.  love the remote feature!  i can turn it on and off during the night without getting out of bed.  :O)
 Great product. Air flow is perfect and a well made fan.
 Very sleek and nice looking.  Quite easy to assemble base.  Great air output.  Rather large but easier to store than a pedestal or box fan.
 Love the fan my only complaint is that the on light for the Ionizer it's soooo bright that you can't use it during the night, it iluminates the whole room.
 It's perfect except hard to clean. Be we have a leaf blower. Take it outside and get that dust out. Good buy.
 Beautiful design.  Very efficient and so quiet!
 Nice, light-weight fan. The fan itself is not very loud, which I like. I like the timer feature. It's nice setting it before I go to bed that way I don't have a fan running all night. It required mininal effort to assemble (just the base). Would recommend.
 definitely not as good as some of its  Lasko brothers
 The cool air feature on the fan is very nice on hotter days, and it has a pretty strong current, the only complaint I have is the swivel function did not work for very long before breaking.
 didn't realize it does not contain a heating function
 like it, but I think the base is somehow loose
 Fan works fine, but builds up a rattle that makes it useless after an hour.  Rattling was so bad it woke me up the first night of use.  I plan on purchasing it again to see if it's a defective unit.
 I will never buy Lasko fans again. I had to return a different model because it stopped working after 2 uses. I exchanged it for this model and it too died within a month. I missed the return window by a week so I basically paid $60 to use the fan twice.
 Nice and quiet.  I like the timer feature.
 I bought this fan to help circulate the air this Spring and Summer; this fan is doing the job nicely. It is in my living room and allows circulation from the screen door throughout the room. I love the different speed settings and high doesn't sound too loud.
 So I have had prior experience with this fan and decided it was time to get my own.  I bought two for my home and they came in two independent boxes and were well packaged.  Assembly was extremely easy (screwing the base to the unit) and didn't require directions (but they were included in the shipment). The air flow out of this thing is as expected - Level one creates a nice breeze which works great for my stuffy office but should I need to create a hurricane effect - I can pump it up to level 3.  You can set the unit to oscillate which works as advertised.  Overall - I am very happy with the construction and performance of the fan.<br/><br/>Note: My AC is on the fritz and these fans did a beautiful job of keeping the room comfortable without emitting ridiculous amounts of noise in the process.
 After regular use for about six months, has started making some perturbing noises. This has raised some serious concerns re: long-term functionality for me, which is sad, because it's a pretty amazing fan!
 When this fan first arrived I was thrilled with the purchase.  About a month after, the rattling started especially when the oscillation is turned on and it's a loud rattle.
 Bought this for our daughter at college in her first apartment.  She LOVES it.  She said it was like having air conditioner.  It was also quiet enough to leave on all day and night.
 Runs very quiet. Love the sleek design. I would buy it again.
 Moves air so well that i purchased one for my Daughter that is in college.
 It was all I hoped for, and it does what we'd hoped it would do. Operates quietly all day long. Used primarily to aid A/C ventilation.
 The fan does just what it is advertised to do. Very quite and we only run it on the lowest speed plenty of air flow.  Have no need in it rotating left in fixed position.  Glen Smithfield, Va.
 This is an awesome fan. It feels substantial, has an interesting but not at all annoying sound, and moves air quite well. I love that you can adjust the airflow up and down. It looks nice as far as fans go.
 I bought this item for my daughter in law and as far as I know she is very satisfied with the fan. She is not an easy person to<br/>please, so if she is happy with the fan it must be a good product.
 Great unit, wish it was slightly quieter; yet offered more speeds. Recommend with the fair price tag

 Gets a small room cold. Easy to install and use.
 Item came seem.as if it was used before.  Remote will not work with fan
 This is a good FAN, although is a little too big to be a fan since it mostly just blows air. This fan is not an ideal for replacing an air conditioner and putting it in a small room, what this would do is really just blow the hot air all over the room which doesn't help unless you have your door open. It gets hot here to the point were this fan is useless, i thought that the fan will blow a lot of air on me but it was no match for a temperature of 90 degrees. The ionizer is a bonus but i don't really see myself using it since i am in a small room with this thing. If you don't know, ionizers removes pollutants from the air by freezing them. they don't really get rid of it since after they are frozen they go down and get attached to anything, which is bad again if you are using it on  a small room.<br/><br/>Apart from this the fan has a timer which is really helpful since i always leave without turning it off. Making the vents go up or down a bit more was also a plus! The controller for this things wasn't big and not small, it fit perfect on my hand. Though one bad thing about the controller is that it can also turn on my Heater from Lasko which is annoying at some times. Least i get to use one controller but still my heater and fan are almost close to each other so when turning on the Heater, i can be turning the fan on.
 With severe allergies,  this  Lasko has given me the best nights' sleep since I got it.<br/>DEFINITELY worth the $ or  more.  It runs all the time.  Love it!
 This just looks better somehow, in my living room, than a box or stand fan.  It fits in a perfect spot for us,although the base footprint is bigger than I was expecting.  It's fairly quiet--normally I like a loud fan for white noise in the bedroom, but for a room where there's conversation and TV, quiet is better, and this fits the bill.  I like the remote a lot more than I expected to--it's nice to be able to turn it on/off or change the settings from across the room.  The oscillation feature is much wider than I expected it would be based on the design, so that's great--it can really sweep the room.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it really is bigger than I wanted in terms of height and circumference, but I suppose that's my fault for not checking the measurements against the others I compared it to.  All in all, the function and design are great, and I'm totally happy with the performance.
 I just received this and love it! I ordered this to help augment air conditioning into my living room and I am so happy with it. It blows into the room enough to really do the job, I'd say it helps cool about a 400sf room, not alone but by pushing cool air further into the room and with the ion feature it feels like nice fresh air. And, it is quieter than my big a/c running on high. Last night I actually turned my a/c off and just used the fan in my bedroom. It was nice and cool, dreamt about how much I'll save on my utility bill.
 It is on 24/7
 The remote does not work!! makes noise! WASTE OF MONEY!!!
 Fan works great but I received an used one. Upon opening it I found a females hair on it and serval scratched on the stand. Would of liked to pay the user price rather than pay the new price but get s used fan.
 This fan is ok. It works pretty much like any fan. Moves the air to help cool the room. I like that is fairly quiet while in operation. I like the ION feature. But I have other fans that I like better. First, the remote is not a really a remote. You have to make sure you are pointing the remote right at the exact spot on the fan so if it is oscillating, you have to wait until the fan turns so the "exact spot" is there. There is nothing on the fan that indicates what the exact spot is. And in the middle of the night if you want to change some setting on the fan, you almost have to do a dance to find the "exact spot".<br/><br/>It's oscillating range seems narrower than other fans I have owned.<br/><br/>The timer feature is strange with all the 1/2 hours that have to be set.<br/><br/>Also, every feature beeps. This is good and bad. It is good because after you have done some dance to try to aim at the "exact spot" with the remote, it is nice to know that you finally found the spot. It is bad because you may not want to hear beeping going on while others are trying to sleep or listen to something else.<br/><br/>Overall, the fan is functional but for the price, I would never buy this fan again.<br/>I have been quite disappointed.
 It's a fan, looks nice, works well, and the kids haven't destroyed it yet, so it must be somewhat sturdy.
 This fan is wonderful! You are talking to a girl who used to wake up in sweats every night in an air conditioned home. I actually get cold at night with this fan at the first setting. Would recommend for a smaller room.
 Lasko makes a great tower fan and this one offered no less then great airflow and quiet movement<br/>on occillation. Love this fan covers a big room without using top fan speed--Plus the built in Onizer is<br/>a great bonus!! Great product. A++++++
 This is an amazing fan... I rented out a room that stayed ridiculously hot! Bought a small 3 ft circular fan that just didn't cut it.<br/>The lasko is fantastic, even makes me cold from time to time. Very very good buy and I highly recommend it. I know a lot of y'all are wondering which is the best, I was skeptical as well and I can guarantee you that you'll love this fan. Quiet, higher powered, COLD air, and a absolute great buy.<br/>For the record I'm a 6'3 roughly 300lbs man that stays hot a lot. This is a great buy. I've had it for about a month and half and so far so good. Been knocked over by my dogs (pitbull and German Shepherd) and just keeps on being great. I'll update further down the road... But this is an amazing fan.
 I really like it but if it is even slightly uneven on carpet then you hear a minor ticking noise.
 Very low air flow even on high. Would not buy again.
 It's very quiet and effective so far.  I don't even need to turn it up high to get a good blast of air.
 GREAT PRODUCT, EVEN BETTER SELLER! HONESTLY THE BEST FAN I HAVE EVER BOUGHT. GREAT AIR FLOW AND VERY QUIET!!
 Clattering sound due to cheap installation on the inside. Comes and goes. It's fixable but too much work for me.
 Works perfectly in AZ heat
 Have had it for one year. Use it a lot. Gears are already wearing out (coming loose) and it now makes a lot of noise when running. It has always moved a fair amount of air for the style of fan it is.
 It is a great product. For what you pay, you get a lot. I just wish it were a little stronger.
 Great range and height. Just what I needed to help cool my office. The only thing bad is it smells like burning plastic. Hoping it will go away after awhile.
 It worked great for few months and then stopped oscillating completely. Had bought it based on the great reviews but sadly it did not last long.
 My Honeywell Tower quit on me and I bought this to replace it.  I use a tower fan to blow air into my office at home and I found it a lot nosier than the Honeywell even on low speed.  On the other hand it moves more air too.  I took the old Honeywell Tower to the shop and got it working (sort of) again and use the Lasko elsewhere in our home.<br/><br/>I wrote Kaz company who build the Honeywell and their answer was:  Regretfully, we must inform you that the part you are looking for is not available for your unit and there are no comparable or interchangeable parts. Unfortunately, this product is outside of the 5 year limited warranty.  We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.<br/><br/>My generation call this "planned obsolescence" with the intent of forcing you to buy a new one.  My answer is to avoid buying from them again, consequently I am looking for a non-Kaz quiet tower fan.
 Great! Low noise but effective. I find myself lowering the speed at times because I get cold and I'm one to always run hot.
 Great fan, works perfect and does a great job!
 Love this!<br/>So useful and there's timer for safe sleeping
 It's a pretty good fan and I would say it can prevent from kids' fingers to get into the fan. That's the main reason for me to buy the fan. However, the remote control is made very cheap. My son accidently dropped it once on the day we got the fan and the remote became pieces everywhere. Also, the fan is kinda tall so if your have a crawling infant it might not be a good idea. For toddlers should be ok as I have one 16 months old and one 2.5 years old. They seemed ok with it.
 I love this fan! The air it blows is very cold, and it's pretty powerful. I've been using it for the past month to sleep with (and it's been pretty hot) and I haven't had to put it at max power yet. The remote is super convenient and I really like having the timer, especially because it's so flexible (you can set it at any half hour interval up to 7.5 hours). The only negatives I can think of are:<br/><br/>-The blue Ion light is very bright, as other reviewers have stated. A simple piece of tape solves this.<br/>-I think the oscillation could be a little bit wider, but it works fine for my bed.
 I was so impressed with the performance of the Lasko 2551 Tower fan that I bought THREE... one for a sister, myself and my mom. I am replacing mine after more than two years of almost non-stop use. I plan on ordering another once my budget allows it.  THANK YOU, LASKO!!  Harry Wentz, Vero Beach, Florida
 It also looks great !  I am not going to use the ion button as I read this is actually bad for you.<br/>The smell of "freshness" is actually o-zone toxic crap!  Within 10 minutes of trying the ion button my cat starting coughing.<br/>Research the use of ions in the home-  yet I give it 5 stars as it is a great fan!
 At first this was a quiet fan but over time it developed a very loud rattling noise. I've tried cleaning it out with air but the issue persists.
 doesn't actually do anything for allergies or air purifying but its an oscillating fan so thats cool when it gets hot. i'd probably buy a cheaper one for what it does
 This tower fan provides good air circulation and yet is very quiet. Overall a very good product.
 Not as quiet as the previous model we own. We bought two, and they both have the same humming noise.
 Good product moves air nicely. Hope it lasts!
 Looked at many reviews and this is a great fan! I almost get cold when it's on highest speed! Powerful too!
 Fan worked great, did what it was supposed to do. Unexpectedly died after a month of usage.
 Love it!
 I have had it for a couple of months and it has performed as advertised.  I received it quickly and in great condition.  Thanks!
 Really cools down the whole living room!
 Fan works as expected.  Various speeds, oscillation and remote control are great features.  The fan is hardly noticeable visually and audibly.
 Love this fan! Quite and strong.
 Very stylish model but not enough air blowing to comfortably cool a room 15'x 12' as their older oscillating Lasko (tower) fan that was purchased in 2007.  This model need to be assisted with a second fan.
 Absolutely love this fan. Works and looks great.
 Works fine does the job
 Absolutely love Lasko's products!  I have both Tower Fan (now) and their Tower Heater, They are exceptional, put out good heat and air, look GREAT and work perfect!
 Works great. Not a big difference from medium to high though.
 I can see why so many models of this fans sold.  It's because it works great, and puts out a quiet sufficient flow of air. Fits so well into a small corner of the room, not taking up additional space for oscillating.
 I bought this fan to put in my living room next to my couch. This is a really nice looking fan and performs just as promised. Like other reviewers complained, the movement of air isn't overpowering but IMO this is what keeps the fan really quiet. It is also sufficient for cooling you off at about 10'-12' away. I'd definitely recommend this fan.
 Got it and gave it away. This is the 3 rd one I have given to a family member. Just purchased another one for me and it is staying
 remote works great, the fan cools well
 Fan showed up in a semi beaten-up box. Plus, the clip on the back of the remote showed up broken so the remote cannot attach to the back of the fan. Fan operates just fine so far though.
 Nice and cool.  Sturdy, streamline.  I would like to point it up to the ceiling but it only points straight and down.  Would buy it again.
 I love this fan. It works great! I will have to say that it is a little bigger than I expected BUT I should have paid closer attention to the sizing information. I love the remote and the ion feature. I am very pleased with the purchase. You cannot go wrong with buying this fan!

 We've been buying this fan unit for years.  Just grabbed two more as we live by the beach and don't have AC.  The remote is handy and works well.  I'd say life-span is a couple of years if you remember to clean it out regularly.  Good, worthwhile product.
 I have had this fan for about a month, and I really like it.  My only complaint is that the remote seems kind of weak, but I can live with that; it has made a big difference in the temperature of my bedroom, which is at the end of the house and doesn't get much of the A.C.
 Works fine.
 Keeps my office comfortable. No complaints.
 Works great!
 Works good. the remote is hit or miss but other than that it does what it should.
 I really should have read the description because the fan was taller than I had expected, but it ended up being a good height for where we chose to use it. We liked it so much that we've already recommended it to someone else who subsequently purchased one for their home.
 This fan does not have hardly any power to it. Even on high, unless it is 4-5 feet away from you, any farther and you cannot feel it.
 First I bought a Honeywell - it was so cheaply made the base of the unit was broken when I opened it. Spent a bit more for the Lasko, and it is much more solid, stable and sturdy. Now if the fan was a bit quieter - not that it is noisy - it would get 5 stars.
 The fan itself is very good.  I have had it for a few months now and the motor still runs silent.  It gives a large amount of air when on high which coupled with its oscillation can cool down a room.<br/><br/>I almost gave it three stars however because the remote has only worked intermittently since coming out of the box and it would be nice to be able to use that feature.
 Great fan.  Bought this a couple years ago for my husband as he overheats at night and it still works like a gem (gets used EVERY night).
 Relatively quiet, moves a lot of air, takes up little space, looks nice.  Can't ask for much more in a fan.
 Nice fan. It's quiet and cool.
 Working well ... thanks amazon
 It is quieter and pumps out more air than my 16" conventional fan (which is also a Lasko). Remote works beautifully, although I wish I didn't have to turn on the oscillation every time I turned on the fan. It would be nice if it remembered the last settings and went to them automatically when turned on. At least it remembers fan speed.
 rather silent, does the job, happy with it
 Great
 I love this fan. It is sleek and quiet. I can feel air from it all the way from my living room to my kitchen. It was shipped in nice packaging, and I had all the parts and screws. It is cool that it has a remote too. It makes me feel fancy! :)
 This fan is a good product and a good buy.....assembling the base and affixing it to the tower took all of 5 minutes...fan's 3 speeds gives one options for the amount of air you want to move....timer is nice as is the option to have the fan oscillate (or not)....remote works well...simply a good product and a fair price for the quality.
 The fan works great for a few minutes until it begins this constant annoying rattle making it insufferable to use. This would be a great fan if it didn’t rattle on any setting.
 Easy to put together. Quiet !!!  Appears to be really solidly made.
 i love it so much.. it is so nice one.. i bought it twice because this is good  product ..
 Replaced it, had a Seville, that only lasted 6 months
 TOPS.
 Love the look - like that it rotates - doesn't blow as hard as I'd like but does circulate the air in a room.
 I think it's been about a year since I bought this and I've only used it during the summer when it gets super hot.  It's making a ticking sound when on the lowest setting.  I have to hit it real hard to make the ticking sound go away - but then it comes back.
 LOVE LOVE LOVE this fan.  I bought one about 6 years ago and it ran 24/7 for nearly the entire time we owned it.  I was really upset when it finally died.  I bought a Honeywell brand for around the same price and though it works ok.  The remote control is poorly designed and you have to press the oscillate button many times before it actually catches.  We I decided to buy another tower fan for our upstairs, I hoped to find the same Lasko I had that worked so well.<br/><br/>And THIS is the one!!!!  Super easy assembly.  It's taller which seems to circulate more air.  The price was comparable to the Honeywell.  The remote is small and nicely designed (one push on the appropriate button is all you need).  It has a rather small footprint so it tucks between the furniture and is hardly seen.<br/><br/>This is a great purchase... I'm so happy to have found it on Amazon again!!  Highly recommend this tower fan!
 This is a beautiful non-obtusive fan that throws a LOT of air right where you need it.  Not to mention the ionizer as well.<br/>It is pretty as well. Great value for the price.  Very Large Fan!
 It is a nice tall size with an easy to use remote. It's just what I needed to use in my office.
 This fan is still kicking after 3 years. I do not use it heavily but it is still quiet and has a great breeze for its form-factor. The remote is a great feature, too.
 This is the King of tower fans. It does not get any better than this. The thing is enormous. It works perfectly. Assembly should have been easy, but it was missing hardware.
 This is the best fan I've ever purchased,  I was really impressed with the solid construction, whisper quiet operation s and outstanding performance.  It's very handsome to boot.
 We've had this fan for about a year now and it is still the best fan we've ever owned!!! We move this fan around to every room we are in in the summer time!!! We ended up buying a second one not too long ago!!
 I was given one for a birthday gift a couple of years ago.  When my old fan died this year, I ordered another.  They are the best, they are quiet, and nice to look at.  I am very happy with both and highly recommend this product.  Love the remote too!
 For $80+ this is a 2 star product.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Doesn't even oscillate 45 degrees,<br/>- Not very powerful<br/>- Flimsy construction
 It is very quiet.  When on the highest fan speed, the air still doesn’t blow very hard.
 Great fan
 All reviews pertaining to this fan are false. DOES NOT blow cool or colder air, just a tall plastic fan that does not blow hard. Waist of time unless you just need a tall fan.
 This fan is okay, but not as good as it should be. The remote is nearly unusable from across my small living room and the amount of turn it makes during oscillation is very narrow, so narrow as to make oscillation ineffective. Not worth the price. I had previously purchased similar fans from the Holmes brand and they were half the cost and no more disappointing than this fan. I really do not understand why fan manufacturers cannot seem to get a remote to work with their fans. If you need a remotely controlled fan then pass on this fan.<br/><br/>PROs:<br/>- Runs quietly.<br/>- Nice feature set.<br/><br/>CONs:<br/>- Remote rarely works from farther than 10' away.<br/>- Oscillation only covers about 35° to 45°.
 I'd like to give it a 4.5 but I can't. The features ate really great. And the price is really great and it's quiet but I wish it blew just a little harder.
 Highly recommend. The remote control is quite handy as well. I don't know what the ion does, though, so I don't use it. I've had it for almost a year. Overall, I'm very satisfied.
 I love this thing and it's on my favorite purchase. I like that it has a remote with it and I leave that on my night stand. It's not super quiet but neither is it real loud. It does a great job of cooling down my bed room.
 We use this ALL summer!  Bought a smaller version for kitchen counter.
 Lesson six months after purchase and it will no longer osculate.
 love it. very sturdy, works well, easy to use. relatively quiet and cools a decent amount of space.
 Arrived with a big crack in the side of it.  Seems to work and I don't want to wait for a replacement.
 I have 2 of these- they work well.
 Bought for my son who is very picky.  Doesn't like extra noises in his room.  He unpacked it with all negative thoughts.  In less then a day he decided he loved it and was going to keep it.  With that said, it is very quiet.  He loves the remote so he doesn't have to get up from playing his games on the computer to turn it on or off.  It is a very slender/sleek look.
 Didn't blow air past our nose thought it would ventilate at least our small office but it didn't.
 Powerful fan. Tends to fall out out of the outlet sometimes but it could just be our outlet
 Fan produces good airflow at a reasonable noise level. This product keeps muy living room nice and cool.
 Soooooo helpful and quiet.  I love the remote control, the ion option and the cooling factor.
 I loved the fan but it's a little loud when the air is blowing on high. I had one exactly the same and it wasn't as loud but love the fan!!
 Easy set up. I turned it upside down and put together the base; it took less than 5 minutes.<br/>Very quiet fan and great air flow!
 Got two. Love 'em.
 This fan is loud.  It works great, but the nose is a distraction for me and takes a little time to get used to it.
 Fan was rubbing against frame
 Good fan with small footprint. My husband already used 2 of them in areas where he sits. I don't normally like a fan blowing on me but during a hot and muggy midwestern night i tried one of his and decided to get one for myself. I prefer the summer heat over ac and this helps me stay more comfortable (non-sweaty!). I keep it about 10 feet from my chair and use the low setting, and this keeps me plenty cool!
 Fantastic fan. The highest setting blows much more air than I had anticipated. It worked great to cool down a bedroom in the Boston area during the summer months.
 The fan started rattling loudly within 3 weeks of purchase and woke us up from sleep on multiple occasions. It might be good in another setting, but not in a bedroom.
 it's quiet and pretty strong
 Great product. I like the ionizer and the fact that it occilates. It is tall and thin and in have it in our work out room, so I'm not concerned with aesthetics.
 I am used to the loud box fans so I had to get used to the fact that it's much quieter.  I put it right by my bed at night and it blows on my body and it feels SO COLD like that.  It doesn't fill up my entire room with cold air, however, but for what it does do, I absolutely love it.  Plus it looks nice.  I like that it has a remote.  I love the product.
 Fan has been working for a long time now. No issues
 Love this fan ! Best we ever bought blows cool air !
 Works great love the remote!
 I am a fan person and this is a good fan that doesn't take up a lot of room
 Moves air great, but started rattling within 48 hours. We need a quiet fan for the bedroom. Returning.
 We really like it, it looks good and throws out a lot of air
 Nice fan quite
 Initial impressions of this fan are great.  We run the fan for probably 18 hours a day so its gets a lot of use.  I really wanted something quiet and this fits the bill.  Of the three fans we've owned this is probably the best.  Our previous fans were a Honeywell and a Ozeri Ultra 42 inch Wind Fan - Adjustable Oscillating Tower Fan with Noise Reduction Technology.  The Ozeri was nice, but after a year the oscillation feature broke.  The Lasko 2551 is definitely quieter tun the Ozeri was.<br/><br/>There are two things I don't like about this fan - (1) It only rotates 45 degrees and (2) there is an extremely bright blue light when you turn on the ionization feature.  I can't do anything about how far it rotates, but I was able to place black electrical tape over the blue light.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great fan and I hope it lasts.
 Received promptly works very well to circulate the air in our home.  We also have one in our camper, great when you have limited space.
 This fan sucks. If you are in a 5x5 room is May service it’s purpose. This thing barely moves any air around. I wish I never bought it. For reals. GARBAGE
 Works excellent
 I bought this about 6 months ago and 4 months into using it the buttons on top stopped working.  I still was able to use the remote control to switch settings and now the remote control doesn't even work.  It won't  oscillate anymore.
 It works OK but the front is all scratched up.  It looks like I paid full price for an item that was previously used.
 Very decent space saver fan. very quiet and working for me already for few months.
 This fan kicks a great amount of air out. Small footprint.
 Got this as a gift for my son and daughter (in-law) in another state. Was sent with no problems. Easy to set up and they LOVE it.
 Works very well
 It did indeed meet all my expectations, but then I knew it would. We have an identical one that we've been using for several years, so we knew the product was good.....that's why we chose this one :-)
 I'm giving it four stars, only because the air velocity is not as strong as my old tower fan.  Great functions, works well and very quiet.  If you want a great-looking fan, this is it!
 Easy to install and setup. Got it running in no time. Provided remote works great. Fan is not super quiet, but I won't say its very noisy either. The only downside I find was that the difference of the fan is the 3 speeds was not much noticeable. The lowest fan speed should have been a bit slower as it feels very cold when all you need is a slight breeze.
 This is a very well designed fan.  Our previous one died after 8 years; we were lucky we thought to buy the same model again and hope that we get the same life out of it that we did with our first one.
 Great product, works really well! Box was a little beat up when I received it, could ship a little better.
 Bought this fan for my granddaughter in her dorm room. She loves it.
 works very well. quiet. options for fan strength are nice. didn't think i would care about the remote but i use it frequently to adjust fan.
 My fiance and I are very happy with the purchase of this Lasko fan.  We just bought a new house earlier this year and it is a bungalow built in the 50s, therefore the insulation isnt the greatest (especially upstairs).  I bought this fan so that it would make sleeping a bit more comfortable in the hot summer months.  Its so comforting having the fan on the 2 or 3 setting, on its oscillating mode while you are sleeping.  Contrary to what some others are saying, the noise is NOT annoying/loud at all.  Its common 'white noise' provided by any other fan I've ever had in my life.  To most people this is tranquil and I agree.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1: fan covers are a vast area when oscillating...can cool a whole room<br/>2: NOT loud - provides typical tranquil ambiance<br/>3: ionization setting noticably cleanses the area from extra dust/dander/etc<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1: when ionization setting is on, the blue indicator light is a little bright to have on while sleeping (in my opinion)
 not strong air flow for me, smelled a bit strange and noisy a little bit.<br/>returned it, bought dyson AM tower.  yes, more expensive but worth it
 I would recommend this fan unreservedly. Works like a champ without making a lot of noise and keeps our electric bills down as we live in Phoenix, AZ. Stylish enough that it does not detract from the room décor. We own 3 of these and love them.
 Good fan to move the air in our living room.  Quiet enough not to drown out the TV.
 Very quiet but not as breezy as a Lasko 18" pedestal fan. You can definitely feel even if you sit 8 feet away from it. But if you want to move a lot of air, this may not be the right choice.
 Works great
 It's very quiet, has several settings, including oscillating. It's tall, so it covers lots of space. Having the remote is very handy, too. I've purchased their heaters and fans before, and am always pleased.
 Love this fan!
 like the shape like the performance.
 Wont buy it again - output is medium - I have a lower end fan with better output and quieter.  I think I will skip the Lasko brand from now on.
 This fan sure enough got me through the hot summer months without air conditioning. I don't know what I would've done without it beside my bed at night!
 The fan works great. Louder than expected. The big problem is that there was no remote in the box! That was one of the big draws for me, so very disappointed that it was missing.
 Loved this fan when we first purchased it but it is not making a terrible grinding noise when it moves and we have only had it for about 2 months. Now our return period is up so I can't get a replacement! 👎 Not very happy overall!
 Excellent fan.Well worth the price.<br/>Easy to set up,with good controls available.<br/>Could ot be more pleased.
 I wish I bought this sooner - ended up buying two!
 I bought this fan because I loved it at my sister's house.  I'm so happy I bought it because it works perfectly in my large family room and is inconspicuous.
 I sleep so much better with this thing
 it's quiet . nice fan.
 It's okay, but it smells.  It works well and is quiet, but it smells and I made my husband put it in the garage.
 Received it fast and love my fan. I use it in my bathroom in the morning when I am getting ready for work. It helps to stop me from sweating.
 Great fan when it worked. Fan started to die after a month of moderate use. Disappointing.
 Good fan.  A little tough to clean.
 I'm very happy with this item  and I would re-order item. Item has kept sm.-med. living room area cool and fresh in almost 100 degree weather. Unit does not have an A/C.
 As advertised, works well
 I use this fan in my office where the A/C isn't strong at all and have to admit, even in the hottest of summer days, so far I have not needed to go beyond 2nd speed. The fan is great. The rotation angles covers a good a distance. It just WORKS!
 Fairly quiet on its highest setting and the air is quiet cold.
 We've had this thing running almost non-stop and it still runs amazing. Good buy.
 It not only helps keep us cool, but it fresshens the air as well.
 Great fan, powerful even on the lowest setting
 This fan doesn't cool an area very well. Nice looking however disappointing.
 Great looking fan BUT.... after about two weeks it started making noise. This one is going back. I don't think it's broken, I think it's in the design. In addition I find that the base is a little insecure.
 good
 I love this fan! its quite, though stands tall.  I love the remote I can turn my fan on after getting in bed and forgetting to do so. Works great!
 really strong
 Quiet. Cools well. My second Lasko fan. First lasted five years.
 I purchased for my mom and she loves it. She loves the fact it stands up on the floor and has a remote.
 My husband loves this fan. Arrived quickly, easy to install, works great!
 Man this is a really good fan and works we'll with the remote control.
 Love this Fan!  It's light, quiet and puts out a tremendous amount of air .  Just needed a little something extra at night and this was the perfect choice.
 bought for my mother and she loves it
 Easily fits in corner!  Love the oscillating feature.  Definitely gets the job done.
 This fan has been a lifesaver - I live where it is over 100 most summer days.  Recommend it!
 Great product will order another one!!
 I am not sure why these are even called fans when they cant blow enough air. So many good reviews looks fake or people just want some good looking fan. This is absolute crap, it cant blow enough air even at the max speed. I dont know what these kind of fans are meant for.
 This fan was bigger that I expected it to be (probably should have read the measurement specifications) but it's really great. Love the little remote and best of all its quiet enough to use in the bedroom.
 I bought this fan after reviewing a couple of customer reviews. The one attribute that I was sold on in the reviews was that the fan is not noisy. I had another lasko fan that was so noisy I always had to make a choice between having it on and watching my tv in the bedroom! This fan is elegant and is so quite even a caveman will love it! The ionizer gives it added breeze and the remote control means I don't have to go back and forth to turn it on and off or to increase or decrease the speed. It also has a timer which is great as you can read the weather forecast and set it accordingly such that if the temperature was to drop in the course of the night while you're sleeping, the fan will go off by itself. So far, it's the best fan I have ever bought and I will strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a fan worth the money!!!
 Very nice for the price good buy very cool air I love it
 It works wonderfully, I love it.
 Arrived late but this is a really nice fan. Performs like advertised.
 The tower fan is quiet and efficient. We put it in our hottest room up stair and it is working well.
 I bought this when I moved into a house with two other roommates who liked to keep the temperature up really high. I was always in sweats so I bought this fan. It helped so much! It helped keep our electric bill down and it cooled me down also. It works great.
 Awesome fan. I try to keep my A/C off if it is possible. This fan is great. It puts out a great amount of air, even on low. And the remote makes it nice to change it or turn it on from anywhere in the room.
 This is a dream fan. There's no extra noise just the sound of air. Love the remote control feature. Although this fan is large, it's very lightweight so I can use it between 2 rooms. The fan is very sturdy with a large base.
 We needed a tall, upright fan in a certain room in the house and this one is perfect.  I wish the base platform was a little bigger so when someone bumps it, it doesn't fall over.  It doesn't happen often but it would make it more functional.
 It works well but it was missing the screws. I don't want to send the entire unit back to get screws. Just send me the screws and I'll update my review. The fan works great but isn't bolted the the base!
 I am a fan of Vertical Fans. LOL  These type of fans enable you to more precisely direct the air flow.  I am sold. Also a fan of Lasko products.
 I highly recommend these fans. I've purchased  three of these fans and use them in offices where i have two empoyees.  This fan are prefect for cooling the air and cleaning!.  I haven't had any issue except with the last purchase. I didn't recive the screws to attached the base to the fan nor did I receive my receipt of payment.  Other than that this is a fantastic fan.
 Pretty good air circulation - use it in combo with other fans on hot day.<br/>Mostly like it for it's vertical space profile and it's rotation ability - works well / looks good.
 Does the job well. Great for my Studio
 Remote and oscillating is great
 Although the fan is quieter on high speed than my previous fan, it is louder than my previous fan at lower speeds. Also, the ionizer light is super bright, almost blinding in the middle of the night.
 This fan is terrific!  I bought it with high hopes and I wasn't disappointed.  Exactly as described.  It's quiet, has great multiple functions and best of all there is a remote for it!  Amazon didn't let me down and I will be back for more items from them.
 The fan is nice except it has an odd buzzing sound that is very distracting and makes me unable to run the fan while I'm trying to sleep, and my some purpose in buying the fan was to use it at night.
 Working great.  Thank you.
 wonderful
 My friend liked the one I had because it was quiet so I bought one for her.
 Ive had it for about 2 weeks now, So far so good, I love it.
 I research everything thoroughly before making a purchase and I did just that with tower fans before finally deciding on this product. I was looking for a taller fan because my bed is high and the 42" is just what I needed. However, I read numerous reviews that the fan was extremely powerful and put out a lot of air. I have a $20 fan at home that I bought 3 years ago that puts out more air. The main reason I purchased this fan is because my wife said the old fan was ugly. Tower fans are convenient for living rooms or offices where space is limited. Also, this fan is extremely quiet, which is what most people like in a fan, I however prefer to have noise when I'm trying to sleep at night so that is a negative for me.
 This is a large floor standing fan. Great for smaller rooms
 High speed is lower than low speed on my other Lasko fan.
 Nice and quiet while still putting out a decent airflow.
 Great choice for the price! Only downside is it only oscillates like 25 degrees... Just fyi
 Works better than I expected.
 stellar fan, with Ion on the room gets colder, just have to remember to clean out the fan once in a while so the dust doesn't block up the vents.
 loved it
 The unit has a few things I didn't like.  Not enough air flow,  rotates less than 45 degrees,  remote doesn't work as expected and a bit noisy.<br/>I don't recommend this manufacture to anyone. Tried three of their units and for the price,  I find the unit too expensive.  The plastic is paper thing.
 Great
 Best fan ever!  Includes a remote!
 excellent worked perfectly!!
 The range of motion/sweep could be a little broader.
 Its quiet and powerful, perfect for next to the bed.
 Works great. The ion light is super bright in a dark room. Won't need a nightlight for the kid.
 It was a little larger then I expected but it cools well and is very satisfactory.
 this fan is disappointing. For the price, I would have expected better output. It's not very cold, even on the highest setting.
 Really like the quality and look of this product. It is nice enough to complement your decor.  Very please moves the air well but is not loud
 I just got my fan today.  After reading all the reviews on here, I have this to say to all you people who write about just how much air this thing moves and how you feel like your house is going to turn into a vacuum because this thing suck so much air: what are you smoking?  This thing does a pretty average job at moving air.  I have 1000 sq ft two-story apartment and it does an ok job moving air around the bottom floor.  Wind tunnel?  Not even close.<br/><br/>Do I like it?  Yeah, I guess.  It does an ok job.  I don't need a wind tunnel.  But for what it is, it seems a little pricey.  The rotation is only about 90 degrees too, it should do at least 180!  Or be configurable?  Come on.<br/><br/>Remote seems a little silly but whatever, it's cool.  Ionizer I think is a marketing gimmick.  I was going to order another one of these for my kids' room but I think for the price I will just get a window fan that moves way more air than this thing.<br/><br/>Mixed feelings about this fan.  I guess I'll keep it but it makes me wonder what kind of drugs the 5-star people are on.
 Worth every penny. This fan is strong &amp; quiet. Kept me cool in a very hot Los Angeles summer.
 like it
 works perfect!!!
 The fan is a great height to reach over the bed, and is relatively quiet for the amount of air it puts out (with three settings, you can always just turn it down a little).<br/><br/>We live in San Francisco and don't have air conditioning, so on warmer nights this fan is a life saver.
 Great tower fan not as quiet as I hoped it would be but we are still happy.No bright lights on the controls which is nice too.
 All the features are great for the rotation and fan speeds, to the remote control and the timer. Great versatility.
 We use this often and it's great.
 QUIET.  Number one best feature.
 Love this fan! It is not as bulky or ugly as a box fan, and fits neatly into the corner next to my armoire. The air is always fast enough even on the lowest setting.
 Easy to set up, remote works just like unit, gives nice breeze
 I have had this fan for about three days. And that's about as long as I can take it. The fan makes a very loud rattling sound at every setting. It gets better for awhile, then comes back with a vengeance. All the reviews I read indicated that this fan is supposed to be quiet, and that was a major reason for my initial purchase. I want a quiet bedroom fan... but this fan I can hear rattling from three rooms away!<br/><br/>I will be returning this fan for a replacement. I am convinced I have a defective model. I am pleased with its air-flow and I like the ionization feature, so hopefully the replacement model will be more quiet. I will update my review when I receive the replacement fan. As of now, buyer beware... this thing is obnoxiously loud.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I got a replacement unit and it has performed flawlessly for three years. I just got a dud unit before. Changed my review from 2 star to 5 stars. I'm very happy with the purchase now.
 I was looking for a tower fan and my first choice was Honeywell Fresh Breeze Tower Fan with Remote Control, HY-048BP which I ordered as well. Though it is pretty easier to assemble, it does not look so sturdy. Also the oscillation was not working. So I returned the fan and ordered the Lasko as a second thought. It came out to be a very good decision. This fan is also pretty easier to assemble and looks sturdy.<br/>The design, look and feel is food. it wont look out of of place in a room.
 I had the same fan for a long time it just broke on me,so I bought a new one just like that but the air pressure is much much less than my old one and I am not happy at all. They really need to know that they lower graded the same product.
 A little too noisy, but I hope it lasts a while? The last one broke down after just a few uses!
 Honestly I have zero complaints. Yes, my review is that simple. Love it.
 Bought as a gift, and extremely disappointed in performance. I've bought Lasko fans for ten years and never had a bad one, but apparently this one was a terrible performer. Barely a gentle breeze. Huge hassle to unpack. Not recommended whatsoever again.
 Great airflow and quiet. Feels solid. Hopefully it will last.
 Fast delivery, exellent product. Noise level on the wind curve is not a problem...it's quieter than a regular fan. Not silent though...but it exceeded my expectation based on other reviews about loudness...I remain pleased with purchase.
 Love it
 Good fan but recently developed some noise even though it is still new.  I don't need or use the remote, so I paid for something I didn't need.  The de-ionizer just adds to the expense needlessly.
 Great fan
 Works well on low for me, seldom used higher speeds. Love that it has an ionizer.
 Keeping the air moving.  No problem in putting the base on.
 Best fan we ever had! Quiet and great air flow.
 Quiet great performance
 It's very good and I'm thinking of buying a second one
 had a round lasko and thought this would look better in my den....we are very impressed with how easy it was to assemble and how well it works.  Would be ordering another but it looks like there is a hold on this one.....unhappy
 This fan is nothing short of awesome. It is the perfect height, and has many different settings that are extremely useful (timer, oscillation, etc). I love the fact that it comes with a remote. I use this to cool my room, which the A/C does not do a great job at. I usually set a timer for 4 hours right before I go to bed.<br/>This is great for medium sized living rooms and any bedroom. I love it!
 keeps my cool at night, also quiet
 This fan works awesome. For myself I dont care for it in the bedroom, due to the height of my bed. But in the livingroom or infront of the front door in the morning to draw in cool air. Works great. I would recommend to anyone.
 More money than I would like to pay but it’s a wonderful, high quality fan.
 Great tower fan for bed room good air flow and dosen't make any disturbing noise.
 I love this fan, especially because of the remote. I can turn it on and off from bed, its quiet, and provides three different air strengths.
 Fans makes clicking noises if it is plugged in but not turned on. I can see the rotor inside trying to move. The has already gotten quite very loud when turned on as if it is 500 years old.
 It is inexpensive and easy to put together but the best part is it works. Good for money.
 I LOVE this fan. It blows cold air like your in front of the a.c. I love it so much I bought two and I will be buying two more for my kids.
 Love this fan -it doesn’t just blow warm air around the air is cool.
 Fan worked great for 6 months.  Then the motor burned out this week.  Too expensive of an item to crap out that quickly with minimal use...3-4 nights/week.
 powerful fan that works quietly and puts out lots of air.  I use it in an exercise area and have been very pleased.
 Great product, it was advertised as very quiet, it is not as quiet as I would have wanted, still, it is great how you can program the time and other functions, overall a great product.
 This fan is everything I expected from reading other reviews and the specs on it. This fan is much quiter on its high setting than a pedestal fan. It is not quite by any means but in comparison to pedestal fans it is probably 50% quieter.<br/>This fans remote works really well and it does not cause any beeping noises when switching settings like other fans in the past have done.<br/>The one negative I would say is that its rotation degrees are limited. It probably only rotates 60 degrees so if you are wanting to blow air in a large area it will not span the entire room...to give you an idea of its span, at approx 10 feet away it will rotate approx 16 ft...i dont know the math on that nor is it definite but gives you an idea for if its setup in a living room and you are wanting it to blow on a couch or something.<br/>I would recommend this fan and will probably buy more in the future
 AWESOME! Best fan i ever purchased. It has 3 speed settings, oscillates in a nice curve, very quiet but blows cool air and has a remote control. Great for the price i paid. Delivered on time and very nicely packed. I would buy it again!!! Get the Lasko 42 inch Wind Curve Fan!!!
 Works great, really quite and the remote control is super
 GREAT for those super hot sunny days, or if you have no AC!!!!! 100% would recommend.
 She loves it
 Great and its not loud. I'm not sure about you but I am one that does NOT like loud obnoxious fans.
 In less than a month the fan went from being nearly silent to being so loud it's almost unusable. I only use it a few hours a day too.
 We have one of these in nearly each of the rooms of our house, and are very happy with their performance.
 Works great! We haven't used all of the bells and whistles, but the basic fan keeps us cool on the hot summer nights.
 Great fan, very quiet
 when the fan is on the highest speed it is like it is one speed one.
 Best thing ever! Works amazingly and I’m glad I bought it. Easy to<br/>Assemble
 This thing really helps cool the room down quickly.
 This fan answered our expectations.  It is quiet enough that it doesn't keep our guests awake at night.  The bedroom has no<br/>air conditioning (we live in a retirement facility,) and by turning on the oscillating function, the fan does not constantly blow right on our guests.  I would highly recommend it.  Its size is perfect, it fits into a corner of the room which allows it to cool every inch of the room when it is oscillating.
 I love my Lasko wind tower! It's quiet, has a nice sleek design, and you can set a timer easily to run for 30 minutes, an hour or more. I also love how light and portable it is, so you can easily move it to different areas.
 It’s a very good fan, not noisy at all. I have been using it from last few months and I am very happy with it. Having a remote is very handy and it’s not that expensive.
 Love this fan.  I bought another one for the bedroom as well.  I bought this one to replace another unit that was similar.  That one started to get noisy when oscillating.  That is the only negative to the fan is that after about 3 years the oscillation motor gets noisy.
 Bought this for my wife for bedside; perfect height, not too loud (to meet is white noise and quieter than the old fan) and the rotation is just the right amount and the small footprint is really nice.
 This fan works great. Nice and quiet!!  I recommend.
 So far we love the fan, hope for it's long life so we can continue to love it
 looks nice but does not give much air.
 I love it and need another one before next summer!
 Cool and quiet. Love it!
 Great fan for small room - easy to assemble and works fantastically- would highly recommend
 So happy I got this. We live in Las Vegas and in 112 degree heat it really helps!
 Garbage , this fan so loud, got a defective one
 This is a nice fan.  It has plenty of power but is not too loud.  The remote works well. However i's hard to understand why a fan should cost so much.
 Love it.
 Amazing design, really cools off a room.  Love the remote (that can be safely stored in the unit) and the timer. Shipped fast, no complaints.
 Very good product.  Arrived as described.  We are very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a tower fan.
 Quiet and it works very well!
 Fan is loud and starts to make clicking sound after only having 45 Days!  And of course the return policy states it is past the 30 day return window!
 This fan is nice, and it is quiet as stated.  I like the remote that is included, a nice convenience, as is the timer.  It is very powerful, compared to our Aloha Breeze fan, currently suffering from a slow "noisy" death.  To be honest, I wish I could've found another fan exactly like the Aloha Breeze, but we searched and searched.  It was actually noiseless for years.  The Lasko is taller, and air flow can be adjusted for different needs, but it sticks out like a sore thumb in our bedroom, which is basically "zen" looking.  I realized that it wasn't a fashion match when I ordered it, but it really hit me when we tried to find a good inconspicuous  place in the room.  All that being said, if you want a bold, rich looking fan that does a great job, that offers a lot of features, and less noise than many others on the market..  then this is the fan to consider.  If, on the other hand you have a link or info on how to order the Aloha Breeze please reply to this thread.
 Great fan, but for two issues:<br/>o This is a 3-speed fan, but the difference between speeds is almost indistinguishable.  Sometimes the lowest speed is just way too much.<br/>o The pivot mode is always off when you turn the fan on. This is especially annoying when using the remote control.  Our older fan remembered the last pivot mode setting.
 Would have given 5 stars if fan was a little more powerful.  Overall I like this fan.  One very nice feaure is the ion generator which helps control dust and gives a breath of fresh air.
 Nice fan, very quiet. The only thing that does not make it perfect is the it does not turn as much as my old one. this one only turns about 30 degrees my old one turned about 60 degrees. So far good fan.
 Better than expected.
 We needed a way to cool down the bedroom during hot summer night's, and this did the trick.  It's quiet, has different settings, and a remote, so you don't have to get out of bed to make any changes.  A really nice cool air fan.
 Works quietly and moves alot of air on low.
 Great fan, very powerful but quiet. Has a good rotation radius, nice clean look, and the settings are great (timer etc). Would definitely recommend to a friend.
 I should have listened to the one of the reviews regarding the noise that the fan made before I purchased my two fans.  We've bought Lasko fans for years and it's one of the most used items from our wedding registry (3 yrs ago).  However, this particular fan - not sure why - made an ANNOYING sound when running.  Still did so after running for about 15-20 mins.  Almost as is if "something" was jarred/jilted loose and it was clicky.  Beyond the "normal hum" of a fan.  Not typical of the other Lasko fans we have in the house of the same nature (minus the fake wood look on the front, which is why I bought them to match my new house).  All in all,  yes - it's a great fan for cooling down a room and circulating the air - but NOT worth it to me for the sound it makes while running.
 Great fan, great price. Not a whole lot of noise comes out of this fan compared to other products in the same price range. Remote is nice and convenient. Sleep with this fan every night.
 Great power to this fan. It doesn't oscillate as much as other Lasko Tower Fans, but definitely gets the job done.
 A little tricky attaching the base.  Seems like a good buy, but have used it for only 2 days.
 Keeps my whole room cool... I love that it doesn't make a "beep"sound when I change the speed of the fan, timer, or turning it on or off.  It's nice and quiet and that's a plus, since I have it in my bedroom.
 It's almost a year, I bought this fan. It works great, puts out a lot of air, not noise at all, easy clean. Space saver. Good buy.
 This is a great fan, it oscillates well and really helps with the air movement in a room.  I use it in a large space and it really cools down the place.  The different speeds are great and it is a really great product, highly recommend.
 works fine
 It blows fine but sure noisy....Much more than the reviews indicate...
 Very elegant and narrow, not as strong as older version but still cools a small room.
 very quiet, powerful, looks nice.  I don't know how to evaluate the ionizer effectiveness, but the blue light that other reviewers mention is annoying.  fortunately, it is easily covered.
 The Lasko fan is efficient and noiseless. Its slim shape makes it barely discernable with the furnishings in the bedroom.
 What an awesome fan.  It's very quiet, which is what I was looking for because we run it all night while sleeping.  Much better power than our previous one.  Worth every penny.
 After visiting my son in Arizona he was using a tower Lasko fan and it gave out so much air and was also very quiet compared to any I have used.  He said he ordered it through Amazon, so I of course had to have one. The 42" wind curve is a perfect size for our family room, it has three speeds and oscillates.  Even tho it came with a remote I did not think that was something we would use.  It blends in perfectly with our room, cools us down and runs quietly so we can hear the TV. Oh, and that remote feature--Well, we use it all the time, just like our TV remote. Love our fan, I also have a small Lasko tower fan on the bathroom counter, perfect for small spaces.
 VERY NICE, JUST WISH IT HAS A SLOWER SPEED. OVERALL VERY HAPPY WITH IT
 Love the product, great air flow in my small apartment. Old roommate had one, loved it so much I bought one when I moved out. Highly r commend.
 It was so wonderful we ordered a second Lasko Wind Curve fan. My kids love the options and remote control. It was so easy to put together
 Great product.  Fast shipping just as ordered. Would recommend.
 LOVE this fan!
 Awesome product.  No issues like posted in other reviews.  Use it every day!
 Noise level unacceptable:returned item.
 just what I expected. Quiet!!!!!
 This was a perfect purchase. I love the look of it and all the features are wonderful and it's tall enough to suit my needs.
 I bought this right as summer season started up and couldn't be happier.  This thing is running 24-7 in my house and is terrific.  It is super quiet (some sound, but enough to be soothing at night) and I love the remote.
 Great product! Easy to assemble, light weight and has a remote!
 Should put out more air
 While un-boxing the unit I was almost overcome by the overwhelming "plastic" smell emanating from the carton, to the extent I had to fight back the impulse to retch.  I thought the stench would go away after a while but it has not.  The fan is in my bedroom at the back of my house but I get a whiff of it when I enter the front door.  If it were not for the difficulty of returning the unit with Styrofoam spacers which have been discarded and the need to find a box to fit it, I would definitely be returning it.  Perhaps this was a one of a kind incident but for me this was a terrible experience and I certainly would not recommend this unit to anyone.<br/>  As to the merits of this fan, I was also displeased by the relatively limited range of the controls.  There are 3 speeds to the fan but all are quite slow, in my opinion.  In addition, the oscillate control is either on or off and it moves through a very limited range--there is no variability to increase the number of degrees through which the fan moves.
 It is a good fan. The oscillating feature is smooth and quiet. The remote is not that great because you have to point it directly at the fan for it to work.
 Love this fan.  Quiet and does a great job.  This is my second one.  And attractive.
 This is th e best
 Great product
 Worked for ~ 60 days and then died .. won't turn on at all.  I have 4 of them and otherwise love the fan but I have to seriously question the quality when the product dies so early.  Very disappointed.
 The screws that were suppose to be included were not. They are required to hold the stand onto the fan. Now I have to start searching the local hardware stores for them. GRRR
 Bought this for one of our rooms that doesn't have a ceiling fan and it did not disappoint. Looks great, keeps the room cool and is not noisy at all.
 This fan was not a new fan as I had ordered. The box was retaped and the packaging inside was torn and retaped. Obviously it was either refurbished or just put back in stock as a return. The motor on this fan had a very irritating constant audible hum. I couldn't stand it. I also did not think the fan was powerful enough and didn't make much of a difference in cooling the room. I am returning it for a full refund and definitely not ever ordering a tower fan again. I read the many positive reviews on this product before deciding on ordering it. I am very disappointed that I got a lemon. Hope you don't.
 Works well, is quiet enough.<br/>I throw a towel over the top to cover the lights.
 Strong air movement, and loud enough for good white noise without being too loud.
 Excellent unit at a great price. Very happy and cool now in South Florida.
 Liked it so much we bought a 2nd one.
 It seems as though this fan keeps getting louder the more it's used- not happy about that!
 I wore my first one out. This one has more features.
 I purchased this this as a gift to my mom, and she loves it. especially that she doesn't have to get up to turn on the fan, she just uses the remote.
 I bought for my daughters first apartment because there was no AC in her bedroom! She loves it! Runs quietly and really cools the room...I'm thinking of getting one for my own house!
 This is a great unit that works well and has very useful features.  It optionally swivels, has optional ionizer, and has 3 speeds.  It also has a remote but it quit working after a week.
 This fan is Perfect!
 While this tower fan has performed without any operational issues, the maximum fan speed is just not enough to help keep the cool air moving in my master bedroom suite, especially here in the Southwest.
 Works well in any room, especially bedrooms
 SO quiet! Perfect for a bedroom.
 Great fan
 This fan is attractive and moves the air quite well. I only gave it a 4 star rating as the remote control was very finicky as you had to be quite close and directly pointing at front of unit for it to work. It also seems a little unstable on a carpeted floor.
 looks good, works well.
 I love this fan.  It is really quiet and perfect for the bedroom.  I like the features, including programming the time, speed and oscillation.  I also like that it comes with a remote.  I thought it was such a great purchase that I decided to get another one for my mom for mother's day.  No complaints at all.
 Looks nice in a business office, runs quietly, and has speed and directional settings sufficient to keep papers from blowing around. The remote makes it all the more convenient.
 You can feel that the room is fresher and cooler , love it
 We bought 2 of these. Great Fan! It is quiet and i love that it has the ionizer option. I highly recommend it.
 Great fan! Love the height, and very powerful!
 Good
 This is a tall and powerful fan. I did not realize how big it was when I ordered it. But I do like it a lot
 Its a great fan with lots of features , could not be happier with the purchase . I love the timer feature which automatically shuts the fan according to the time set up . thumbs up
 This fan was perfect for 2 months and then the motor burned out and now it's broken. I don't leave it running all the time, I keep it on the low setting... I can't see any reason why a fan like this would just break right away.<br/><br/>I emailed Amazon and they sent a replacement within a day. Impressive. I don't see any reason why this next one would break like that... probably just got a lemon.
 Great fan, blows air evenly and is fairly quiet. The small footprint is excellent for small spaces and if you're lazy, it even comes with a remote.
 I bought this for my sons dorm room and he loves it!!!  He says that it is quiet and keeps the room very cool.
 This review is going to be based on the reliability of the unit.  I have owned this unit for over 5 years.  It has never showed any signs of wear or malfunction among that time.  A little cleaning each year helps (with vacuum hose only, not dismantling unit).  During the hot spring and fall days and everyday during the summer this unit has been on.  Usually turn it off during the day when I'm at work.  I keep it in my room all year round. During the winter months I just unplug it and leave it the same spot (my reliability might be better due to the fact that I don't package it up during the winter and have to take it back out when the hot weather arrives, less banging the unit from storing it).<br/><br/>Very happy with this fan, so happy that with my family expanding, just ordered another one. Take Care.
 Received the product 2 weeks later than intended. Item was damaged and did not work. Very poorly designed and I'm furious with the way it turned out.
 I use this every night.  I can set the hours  its stays on.
 Worth it
 The fan worked for 2 Days.  After that whenever we turned the oscillatier, it would stop.  After 4 Days it has stopped working completely but I can’t return it because I threw the box away.
 Its awesome, working as expected
 This fan really throws a lot of air.  I have it on the low cycle.  Have not used the timer yet.
 A little bigger than I intended, didn't realize how tall 42" is. The fan was very easy to put together (I'm only a girl and I did it in a few minutes) It is so quiet, I don't even know that it's on. Rarely need the highest setting, cools my bedroom perfectly! I'm very pleased with the fan!
 Husband needs white noise when we're sleeping, its loud enough for him and quiet enough not to disturb me, the oscillating feature on the fan is great so we both get some air.<br/><br/>We've had it about a year and its still going strong =)
 Lover it<br/> Functions well and puts out great air flo.
 Easy to assemble and use. It works well and blows cool air adequately. It can definitely cool an average room in good time.
 really annoying motor whine; I have another Lasko fan that is better, I figured this would be the same quality. Sending it back.
 Nice &amp; cool
 Hardware.....was not in box, had to call manufacturer to order replacement screws!!  To mount base to tower...
 We do not have air conditioning, and this fan helps to keep me cooler, which makes life more enjoyable.
 Love these! Quiet and sturdy!
 It is a good fan and runs very quiet but still puts out a strong breeze.  The remote is handy to use and stores in the top of the fan so it won't get lost.  We own a couple of them and they hold up well.
 Easy to use, remote control, looks good, put in living room and works exactly as I want/need.
 this is an excellent fan it is quiet and powerful<br/>not that it bothers me but the remote is almost useless, ( poor reception IR type ) and the traverse is about 60 deg. which is fine for me they do have a diff model with a wide traverse if you need it.
 Needed a cheap fan to help keep a conference room that often has several people in it cool. The fact that we can control it with a remote control was a nice perk (who wants to get up to turn on a fan?).
 this fan is a good quality fan i have had it over a year now and it work as goodas it did when i first got it i would purchase another one
 Nice!
 I would like if it put out a little more high when in high, but overall pleased.
 Perfectly cools my room.  It's not terribly noise too.
 Great air flow, remote is very convenient, everything works well. As other reviews have mentioned, it is a bit loud, but the great flow makes up for it.
 The best fan I ever had, special my wife with her heating problem.....
 This fan is pretty and works well. We put some black electrical tape over the bright light, and it helps.
 Looks attractive, but has barely any airflow even on high.
 I live in Florida, and it gets hot (obviously). Using this in an already air conditioned room is amazing. Buy it, use it, love it
 + Quiet<br/>+ Cool air<br/>+ I can feel it from a decent distance away<br/>+ Remote works great<br/>+ Looks nice<br/><br/>Nice purchase to help through those few hot days.
 This fan is amazing. I purchased it because it was recommended by my daughter because she has this fan and loves hers. Its really amazing that it circulates the air as well as it does. It is however quite large.
 It's larger than I expected it to be. Great fan, pretty silent and cooling. The remote does not come with the batteries.
 Keep cool with this tower fan.  I've purchased more than one of these, they run pretty quiet.
 Our house gets very hot in the summer, so we got this fan to keep us cool.  It's a great fan, keeps the whole room cool and I also really like that it has the ION air button for clean air.
 I love it. I use it every night.
 We absolutely love our Lasko fan.  It is space efficient very quiet and powerful has a great range of air distribution and the remote is just an added benefit
 Love it!
 I live in the West and the recent heat wave was brutal, I'm so happy I had this fan on those 105 degree days.<br/> It's very quiet so it's perfect for night time.<br/>Overall I can't find anything to complain about, awesome product.
 Bought this for my mother. It's quiet, efficient, and unobtrusive. Only negative I have is that usually batteries for remotes are included. Other than having to run out to get some AAAs, we're very satisfied with this fan.
 I have no complaints with this fan. I set it up in my room about a month ago and it hasn't been shut off since. I suppose the base could be a bit sturdier, but if you're not beating it up and letting it just do its thing it works just fine. I would buy it again. Also, I had read some complaints about the packaging so I was skeptical. Turns out it appeared to be packaged quite well.
 Quiet and works well ! Love the product
 When I asked for a fan at work they ordered this for me. I loved it so much I bought one for my bedroom. I swear some days it feels like an air conditioner.
 Barely turned on the fan for five seconds before the motor gave out and smoke started to come out of the fan. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
 Low noise good work
 Only worked for 3 days. Wouldn't turn on.
 Great fan and price
 I spent so much time looking for a tower fan to replace the one in our bedroom. My husband needs a fan to go to sleep and I hate the sound of it. I searched for fans with reviews of "minimal noise" and I thought this fan delivered that. However, it is no different than the other fans we owned - pretty noisy to a person like me who do NOT want any white noise. My husband uses it with the lowest setting and it's still loud to me. I have to live with this until we're ready to replace... and I'm too thrilled :( As far as the quality goes, I think it's good. We don't use the timer setting, remote control nor the Fresh Air Ionizer function so I'm unable to comment on those. The sleek design is probably the only reason I am giving this product a 3-star. The looks is what I exactly expected it to be and the gun mental color makes it look modern. I'll give a 5-star for the design and 1-star for the noise level but that is coming from me who absolutely does not need a fan to fall asleep.
 Outstanding, must buy.  Keeps me and the Mrs nice and cool.  Great product if you want to cut back on the AC a little.
 Was pleasantly surprised by this fan! It's extremely quiet compared to the 2 Vornado tower fans that we've purchased in the past. We use them in 2 separate rooms that have TVs and it was a noticeable noise difference, since we didn't have to turn the volume way up to hear the TV over the fan. That's with it on the highest setting. Now it doesn't blow as much powerful air flow as the Vornado but still felt cool. I would say that I actually prefer that now as it doesn't dry my eyes out to sit in front of it. It's very sleek looking in the silver, our other fans are black. But it is much larger than I thought it would be, almost a little bulky for the space I wanted it in but I am extremely pleased with my purchase. Shipped fast too.
 I now have two of them and they work great.
 We have had a Lasko wind curve tower fan for eight years now and it just now developed a unpleasant noise so we bought a new one. We are somewhat disappointed as the new one is very noisy however it does put out a good amount of air so we decided to keep it. The company shipped the fan in a prompt manner.
 Haven't hd it long enough to honestly give it a 5 star rating, however it has proven very effective and quiet enough for me to watch tv at a volume low enough that I don't disturb others in the house sleeping.
 Fan works quite well.<br/>Speed is good and generates good flow of air.<br/>Rotation works well.<br/>Timer is good too.<br/>Not sure about the quality of the Ionizer.<br/><br/>The review is based on usage of 5 months.
 The itself blows nice cool air, but the rotating function either doesn't work or if it does start working (randomly) it makes a loud clicking noise.
 I purchased this fan to replace an older tower fan. I was surprised when the fan arrived, as it was much taller than my older fan. I don't mind the added size since it is being used in a bedroom. The fan is quiet and can be run while watching TV or listening to music without being bothered by the added noise. The included remote is a great feature and stores easily inside the fan so it doesn't get lost. This fan also has the ability to direct the air up or down with a little dial on the front of the fan. This is a nice feature, but I rarely use it because the change in air direction isn't too drastic.
 Geat fan, keeps me cool in my bedroom which upstairs and becomes hot uring the day.  Sound is soothing and not very loud.  Remote takes time to operate which is the reason for the 4 star rating.  Would recommend.
 We love this fan and may purchase another.  Even on warm days it circulates the cooler air in the house.  My sister visited recently and asked how it was circulating cool air.
 Looks nice, portable, not loud and does the trick.
 This is the second one I have purchased.  I liked the first one so well that I made this second purchase and next year I will purchase one more, then I should have all that I need.  When the house is hot I open all the windows to blow the hot air out, then I close them and use it to circulate the air remaining, it makes the house much more bearable.  It is light enough to move from room to room and I am pleased with its performance.
 Great product and pricing!
 Very effective. Much bigger than I expected.
 Nice quality, just what I expected :)
 Works just like we hoped! M-J girls love it!
 great to use if you have a small room.
 This is our 2nd of these fans and I am back to purchase a third.  We don't have AC so on the rare hot days a good fan is needed.  It is a nice fan - pretty quiet and puts out a lot of air, especially with the ION feature.  The remote comes in handy too.
 Bought this fan to supplement a ceiling fan.  It has great features, like a timer and remote; the only downside is I think it is rather noisy, even on the lowest speed.  Maybe it is just because I am used to quiet ceiling fans.  It does do a nice job cooling and fits in a small space nicely.
 This fan looks great, runs great and is very quiet.
 Great fan, throws air well and relatively quiet
 works great, i wish it was more powerful. great value
 its doing A fine job
 This fan is very quiet to run and powerful, does cool the area a lot. I love it.
 It's a nice quiet fan. I like the "wood" finish
 Having a remote is awesome. It's just what we needed for our bedroom.
 Blows you out if the room
 It's strong and works well - easy to assemble as well.
 Very satisfied with this purchase. The fan is so right for my bedroom. I was thinking about buying a portable AC because of the summer heat, but now i dont need that anymore. This fan is enough!<br/><br/>Very pleased with Amazon's customer service too. I am a prime user and the fan was only delivered a day later the guaranteed day. Amazon offered compensation and I really appreciated their attitude.
 The fan arrived with out the screws to mount the base plate. This is very annoying and expected better packaging. The styrofoam that was supporting the fan was all broken and split. Fortunately no damage occurred to the fan. The fan works but cant use it as we can not secure it to its base as no screws were supplied. It looks like a fantastic product but what good is it if you can not assemble it to use.
 We bought this for my daughters room and now I want one for mine because it works so well and really helps cool the room down!
 Great fan!  Quiet and powerful.
 Very nice. Quiet and nice quality as our other 3 Lasko models.
 good unit. could have been more powerful.
 weakest fan i have ever owned.  what a waste of money.
 Yup. It works and looks sleek.
 This fan blows just ok, and is very loud.
 Nice design
 It is kind of loud, I expected to sleep with it and even on the lower level it is noisy. However better than mainstream fans, but too pricey for this.
 Works great. The remote is a bonus. Easy assembly!
 The tower fan is good. The fan is quiet, however doesnt have a true 180 degress swivel, more like 120 degress swivel. We have not used the remote yet while the functions are good for on/off/timer/strength/ion
 I bought this fan for my office. I absolutely love it. It is quiet, circulates the air and actually cools the space.
 The fan works as advertised.  Remote control can be kind of picky when it comes to line of sight.  Lowest fan setting is fairly high.  High setting will blow you over.  Overall, happy with purchase.
 Very Good and Elegant Tower Fan, but the breeze is not as i expected nut man is beautiful =].
 perfect
 This unit blows cool air,and does not make a lot of noise. My dogs love sitting by it. I would purchase again.
 I guess I've never owned a "grown up" fan before, because I am just so impressed by this fan! The remote comes in very handy, it's easy to move from room to room and it does the job.
 great
 Nice fan
 Perfect.........I've purchased a couple of these in the past and liked them. This one is holding up to be one of the best upright fans I've ever used.
 This fan is awesome!
 I love this fan . I wish it rotated a little farther around but it is quiet, moves the air, and looks nice.
 Love!
 It is a pretty good fan, although it is noisier that I thought it would be.
 I am very happy with this fan.  We can use it instead of the air conditioner which saves us $$$$.  It works very well and much better than the smaller units.
 Maybe as an ionizer, but the fan is extremely weak. Use it in an office pointed directly at you, but not to move air with the windows open.
 Quiet, cooling, modern fan. Works great if AC is not an option.
 This is my 2nd Lasko Tower &amp; I love it.<br/>Great fan
 It was just as it was described.
 Circulates the air throughout the house.
 This is a powerful fan. It does a great job of circulating the air in the room and creates a cool breeze. My only complaint is that it is a bit heavy and awkward to move (I move it around the house several times a day), but it's worth it to keep the A/C off.
 Ive had it for six months and now its starting make noises as if the bearings are going out.
 I will never use ceiling fans again.  These fans are great.  I can't believe the amount of air they generate.
 Awesome fan. Super quiet. Low power use.
 I own three great deal cold air and great filter.
 I love this fan! The price and quality can not be beat. It is sturdy, quiet, and works great. Highly recommended!!
 This fan is good looking and it works well so I'm glad I got it.  I took one star out because it is being advertised as a silent fan and there is nothing silent about it. Perhaps "relatively silence" would have been more accurate. To be fair, I don't think there is such thing as a silent fan unless it is dead. Another thing I like about this fan is its portability. It is very light and can be moved around effortlessly. The remote control also comes handy: I can increase/decrease the intensity, start/stop rotation, turn on/off Ionization and set a timer. An extra nice touch is how the remote control gets inserted into the fan's head for storage purposes - this prevents it from being misplaced. Overall, I've been using it for a month in hot and cold days and I'm convinced I made a good choice about it.
 The best column fan available.
 Perfect assistant to our a/c during the hot humid days in So Cal.
 I love this. It doesnt take up as much room as the pedestal fan i had previously, it is quieter and i especially love the the sleep timer feature. Would highly recommend.
 The fan works well. Isn’t loud and was super easy to assemble. It’s a great fan, but I was hoping it was more cooling. Maybe it’s my bad for not researching enough, but there’s no way to set a temperature. It just blows the air in the room around. I do like the ion function that makes the air feel fresher and love that it filters dust. The only thing that’s preventing me from giving 5 stars is that it doesn’t actually cool the air.
 Works just fine thus far.  Generates a good amount of wind and stylish for the more formal areas of the home.
 Fanastic with with plenty of air volume. It is very quiet plus the timer feature adds to its functionality!
 smelled a little as it ran the first few days then cleared out and works beautifully
 The fan worked for about a week then it stopped blowing air.  Everything else worked including the oscillation.  Called Lasko Customer Service.  Absolutely no help.  Said to return to Amazon.  How could I recommend this fan?
 Great Fan, I will definitely purchase another fan like it from this seller again....
 keeps my room nice and cold
 I bought this fan hoping for some nice background noise for sleeping. Turns out it has a really annoying hum.
 very good product very efficient and quiet it blends in with the furniture very much worth the money to help with electric bill
 great fan.  Quiet and powerful.
 This fan is strong, stylish, the speeds are quite different, blows in a wide angle (ideal for a room full of people) and a pretty big area.<br/>But the remote doesn't work that good and the height adjustment is not that big (when I sit in my desk I would like a little more air towards my head - it's perfect for bed or couch though)
 I bought two of these, they a quiet, efficient and move a lot of air.
 We have two of these and both were life-saving when our A/C decided to poop out :) I especially like the features to oscilate, set a timer, and have a remote. Simple to put together. No issues.
 Obsessed with this fan. The setting create an awesome experience. Love it!
 Works wonderfully and is easy to set out of the way.
 Excellent Product.
 This fan may be on the higher end of what I normally would spend but I have two cheaper tower fans that have been a disappointment.  Both are shorter so to get air up around my upper body I had to elevate them on stools.  One of them stopped oscillating and they wobbly when they did. So far this one is pretty quiet, seems sturdy (no wobbling), Good height, has the added Ionizer and the BEST part is the remote.  The timer is a nice feature but I haven't used that yet.  Only assembly was the base and that was very easy to do.
 This fan initially worked great - we used it in our bedroom at night during the summer heat wave.  After a month or so of use, it began turning off randomly in the middle of the night.  After 2 months of use, it broke completely and will not turn back on.  There is no reason that it shouldn't work - it was not exposed to any sort of damage and was only run at night.  We read several reviews before deciding to purchase this fan and are very disappointed at the quality.  We would like to return the fan, however it was only eligible for return during the one month window following the date of purchase, which was before it began to malfunction.  I would not recommend purchasing this fan due to the poor quality and very short life span.
 It is perfect and delivery was on time and done well.
 Love it strong wind flow throughout entire room
 A little bigger than I would like but it is not too loud for the wind that it produces.  Pretty good quality, the remote control is nice.
 Wonderful fan,I purchased several of them.
 Excellent fan. Purchased for my father-in-law for use in a large master bedroom. It really moves the air and he loves it.
 great product
 I was disappointed with this product. The fan didn't throw off much cool air. For a room size that was less than 100 square feet it didn't cool it down at all. Also, two buttons broke after the third use. One positive, the company reimbursed my money and they didn't require me to ship it back.
 great fan. really like the ionizer feature!
 This fan really more than met my expectations.  I live in Vegas and it is perfect.  Ckd a lot of fans and so glad I got this one.
 Good fan and certainly for the price!  Nice power and remote control option.
 Works really well and is high enough to be put on the floor and still reach you if your are on your bed. Isn't that loud. Just to clarify it doesn't cool the air like an air conditioner it is simply a really nice rotating fan.
 Am returning this recent purchase because the fan wobbles on the base.<br/>Being a tower fan, it's just too unstable, as even pushing the buttons to turn it on causes a wobble.<br/>Not a good product.<br/>Will shop retail for a new fan, so I can examine thoroughly before buying.
 Average and not very powerful. Doesn't move enough air
 So I bought one of these back in 2004. It was perfect for me, and it lasted 13 years until it finally broke. I liked it so much that I bought a replacement instead of looking for a new one. It was durable, and treated me well. Works better to blow cool air than the traditional round fan. I'm satisfied with my re-purchase, but there is some differences between my old one and the one I just received that I don't care for though.<br/><br/>1; There is a wirring sound that seems kind of mechanic, not just air flow. I don't remember if my old one emitted a sound when I first got it, but it definitely hasn't in a long time. I've not got use to it, and I imagine it will annoy me for a while.<br/>2; The settings between low, med and high don't feel that much different. While the fan works better than before, the low setting is too 'high'. I live in California where even in the cool seasons it's hot, so it was nice to have a small breeze next to me at all times, but with this new fan, it actually gets too cold and I find myself having to turn it off and on every 15 minutes even when it's on it's lowest setting.
 Extremely quiet and has gear airflow. I bought a Dyson a while back and this fan out performs it without a doubt.
 Quiet, good remote features, powerful enough for a regular sized room.
 QUIET FAN that cools an entire room. Love the remote control feature. Love the air cleaner feature. Love the fan.Buying another one for kitchen.
 This is a great fan.  It arrived over a moth ago and no issues to date.
 Awesome even on low its cold
 Excellent in all aspects. Should of purchased sooner
 BEST FAN EVER
 Quiet, powerful, remote control. Two thumbs up! Easy base assembly.
 It did not cool down our 8x10 bedroom. Just blew around the air.
 Great purchase.
 This fan is exactly what we wanted. A space saver and puts off a fresh air feeling. Helps cut down on the dust buildup as well. The remote is an added bonus!
 Excellent fan, very quiet, lots of airflow.
 Wow! Really great machine.  Hope it last!
 Awesome fan, bery flexible and cool. With amazing settings.
 Great fan as far as keeping the room cool but is a bit louder than I expected and the blue ionizer light is a bit on the bright side. The noise and light just took a bit getting used to.
 I purchased this fan because my old Lasko fan got a little bit melted by the Lasko heater (accidentally too close); the other one ceased to rotate, but it still worked.  This one is excellent. I love the wood-look finish and all of the settings.
 the BEST! i have it right beside my bed for nighttime.
 I would buy from seller again this are very nice and quiet and rotate very good will have to wait until summer real hit. they look like they are going to get the job done
 I would buy from seller again this are very nice and quiet and rotate very good will have to wathey look like they are going to get the job done it until summer real hit.
 Was gifted to someone &amp; they liked it very much.<br/>Stated it was very powerful &amp; liked the design..
 Was advertised as a very quiet fan.  It is no quieter that any other fan I've owned in my 50+ years.
 I purchased 2 of these fans and I'm sorry I did!!  This fan blow out air like a 5yr old child( no wind). Don't buy this fan, instead buy a 20in" box fan you will get more air.
 I'm giving this a 5 because I really have nothing negative to say about this fan.<br/>It looks beautiful in my living room... like a nice piece of furniture.  Great air flow. and super quiet.<br/>You did a good job LASKO!  I'm happy I found it.
 We bought two of these fans as we have a two bedroom apartment with a single a/c unit. The profile of the fan is slim enough that it's easy to have in the doorway to direct air to the rest of the apartment without blocking it. The base is a bit wide and I wish the cord was longer(it's an average length, my plugs are just super far away). Both units are very quiet. The ionizer has been great for allergies but the blue light is kind of bright.  Follow the other reviews and just put a piece of electrical tape over it.
 Started making noises first time I used it out of box :-( too much of a hassle to repackage and send back without box so left with a noisy fan.
 Great fan. Very quite.
 I am disappointed that it isn't more powerful.
 Not the best fan.  I bought  2.  Thought they would move the air.  the highest setting is like med on a regular fan.  ION works bight blue light put electrical tape over fixed issue.  Just an ok fan.
 not as loud as you want it to be! for those folks who have to sleep with a fan!
 This fan is everything we hoped for and it works great!
 I love the fan and the wood grain, and don't forget the remote!!!
 This is my second fan and it is great.  Easy to put together and it is good looking.<br/>Recommend to anyone.
 I wish it could go a little lower in intensity.
 pERFECT IN EVERYWAY
 Not as powerful as I was desiring but it is a great fan though, especially for the price.  seems durable and is not too loud while running.  glad i made the purchase excellent value for dollar
 Not very powerful. Nice functions.
 We're very happy with this fan. Has three speed settings and on max is still very quiet. Cools a large room quickly and looks good too. Only took about 5 minutes to install the stand and have it operational.
 Love it- great fan- good looking , not super powerful but does the job .
 Its tall, its easily moveable, its durable, and it gives out fresh air plus a remote! You can't ask for anything more, guys. Great purchase.
 I absolutely love this fan! I ordered and received this fan in the same day. I’m impressed on how well his fan works. It is a bit loud but it’s not a huge bother.
 This fan delivers everything I was looking for.  It looks good, fits in a small space, provides a nice breeze and is acceptably quiet during operation.  Being able to set an automatic turn-off is also a feature I find useful.
 Love this fan.  So nice to have the remote to change it.  It is not noisy at all.  We run it in the living room while watching TV
 I love it! Our a/c went out in the middle of a hot summer and this fan kept me cool every night.
 this is good
 The best fan ever for the price and it looks nice!
 Great fan. Does the trick!
 Love this can. Makes the air cooler and a bit fresher too.
 Very quiet fan. It keeps us cool at night while we're sleeping. The fiancee loves it. No complaints here!
 Love this tower fan! It is perfect for me as I do not like to be too cold but like a good comfort level of breeze and this is spot on! Easy to assemble and the fan is not noisy.  I am a light sleeper and this does not disturb me at all. If you are looking for a nicely designed fan for your space that is economical but does the job, definitely get the Lasko 2551 tower fan!
 Pretty easy to set up and works perfectly! Very happy with my purchase.
 Works great. Arrived on time. No damage. Was a Christmas present and my daughter loves it.
 works amazing<br/>ionizer light is very bright<br/>fan is quiet and powerful.
 Bought this fan for my husband, who is always hot!  Good design, and great air flow!!  Would highly recommend this unit!
 Not so easy to put the bottom part on. But this is a perfect fan! Perfect size for my high bed. It's super cool and I love that it has a remote. I recommend!
 love this fan, the remote is very nice, and its pretty quiet
 This an awesome fan - works really well - easy to move around and is pretty so it can be in a room and still look good
 It's just not strong enough. Looks decent
 Love the fan, it's not super loud &amp; it cools the bedroom off nicely!!
 Works great for our large, open living space. Taller than expected.  I didn't read carefully.m
 Love this works well .looks much nicer than in the picture even! I am however not sure how to clean it 4 stars
 works great. easy to assemble. ordered it at 1:20pm and it arrived SAME DAY at 7pm! amazing!
 Thank you amazon warehouse best price QUALITY PRODUCT!!!
 Excellent
 Tall and slim, with multiple fan options.  Works great, looks great.
 Good fans, the blue light for the ionizer is unusually bright but that can be fixed.
 five star product for sure
 Bad product and horrible customer service. I tried to reach them because it never worked and they never contacted me back.
 I love this fan!  It's quiet, the remote is a nice feature, and it does a good job moving air.
 Got this for my bf and he said it's runs great and quite ( coming from a very picky person ) I say it's a good product .
 This fan is really quiet and circulates the air great!  Will probably buy a couple more!
 Got three of these and love them all.
 I have two of these fans and I was able to save money this summer without having to turn on my AC.
 This fan takes up a small space but does the job of a larger bulkier one.  I use it in the summer to help spread the coolness of a window air conditioner to other areas.
 best fan ever. feels like an airconditioner . very satisfied.
 Love this fan! It is tall enough that we can still feel the air in our raised bed. I also love the air ion function, but like others have mentioned the blue light it pretty bright!
 This is a California Man's best friend if he aint got much space in studio, honestly it's my favorite fan yet ever
 My wife LOVES IT ! WORKS 1000% BETTER THAN OUR OLD ONE / IONIZER A BIG PLUS TOO !
 good fan real quiet and saves alot of space compared to others i live in weather over 100 degrees almost all summer so at night you pretty much have to have a fan,a/c is real expensive 24/7 and makes your bones hurt if you have arthritis all the time so a real good choice
 No issues, pretty quiet and base doesn't annoyingly come off when you pick it up like other earlier models I've tried.
 Christmas gift, but my daughter said she likes it.
 This fan is very quiet. You pretty much just hear a little bit of air movement noise. It almost makes it feel like it is cooling the air, even though you know it is not.
 Lasted 1 year and 1 week after purchased. It was used sparingly. I do not recommend.
 It's great but it's pretty loud. Everything else is great though!
 They work great!
 Haven't tried it yet, s it's still cool here, but it appears well made, easy to assemble the stand, and I like the remote.
 Works great!
 Works great and is quiet enough not to bother sleep.
 Live this fan circulates the air so good and best of all is so quite. I recommend this fan to everyone.
 Best fan ever. Cools an entire room quickly, operates quietly, remote control works well.<br/><br/>Also helps quickly reduce cooking / cat litter smells.
 Great product at a great price!
 Makes more noise than described.  If you are even the least bit of swooshing noise intolerant look at Vornado.
 Looks sleek in the corner and works well. Good purchase!
 Good fan it does what I need it to do. No real complaints. it is a good fan.
 I can feel it from 10' away and the noise is not overpowering the sound from TV. The oscillating setting is perfect for a big living room. And who knew I would love using the remote control?!!! Will buy again when my little bedroom fan dies.
 Great fan. Could've had a little more cooling capabilities though. It gets the job done however.
 Works well and air distribution is very effective.
 This fan is nice! Every feature works well and the auto-off has many settings. Was worth the money.
 perfect
 I have had a lot of tower fans and this is the best one I have ever had. Super powerful and super quiet...on low power you can't even hear it running. Not for someone who wants a gentle breeze. Even on low the airflow is as strong as a desk fan set on high.
 I used this for a very short period of time but it works quite well and is quiet enough.
 I've had it for 7 years now.  Still runs great with frequent use.  Enough said.
 it seems unstable to stand when it rotates......but it does work.
 Great fan!  Quiet, and works in the entire room  We ended up buying another for the bedroom.  We bought these in lieu of having an electrician come out and wire for ceiling fans.  They work great!
 love this fan, I use it all the time
 Beautiful with our home decor and is very effective!
 tower fan looks and works great. very pleased with this
 Love this fan. It is very quite, plenty of air flow and really nice looking. The remote is nice and small but controls all the functions. Would recommend. Only surprise was it was a little taller than I expected.
 Nice fan with no sound, using it for a while and i  satisfied with my buy
 Great fan !!
 The fan is wonderful, keeps my room nice and cool which js especially great since my room tends to be the hottest. The one major downside however is that shortly after purchasing the fan the room became infested with tiny white spiders. My spouse was the first to notice while I was at work, at first it was only a couple spiders and we just passed it off. A couple hours later we noticed that these spiders were all over our room. At first we didn't think it was the fan, but after turning it off for a little bit we saw as the spiders came out in hordes. We now have to bug bomb our room while we sleep in the guests, and my wife is terribly afraid of spiders so finding this out was not very exhilarating for her.
 Great fan, wish it was just a little more powerful.
 Works Really Well  I might have to buy another.
 quiet
 very nice...quiet, love the remote, a subtle design
 Had a burning smell each time it was turned on. Appears there is a design flaw based on other 1 star comments but with the great ratings, it can't happen twice, can it?  Requested replacement after 4 attempted uses. Update to come!
 6 months later its stilll working beautifully. the cold air ion feature is subtle, but still valid.
 I love everything about this fan and will probably buy another one. 👍
 Quiet and powerful. Would buy again.
 Blows out really cold air. I would definitely recommend this fan. It is a tall fan that distributes air evenly. It will keep you very cool.
 quiet and strong, love the look and small amount of space it takes up
 Would like high power to be a higher so can still have high breeze at a longer distance from the fan.  I have to have it about 3-4 feet from where I want the breeze to feel the high power.
 It's a very stylish fan and it cools really good. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is a bit noisy and rattles at times.
 Fan does not oscillate.  I bought the fan one month ago and it won’t oscillate anymore.
 Great for these hot days<br/>relatively quiet
 This fan is not for cooling but it does have a nice breeze for a small room. Its 4 functions are quite useful and it has relativity low power usage. But if you need to have any legitimate cooling (below 5 degrees C ambient temp) then defiantly get a more expensive ac system, for this fan will not cut it.
 It is ok.
 I love how quiet this fan is and how well it moves the air in our family room.
 It arrived quickly and on time, but within hours of it being on a loud clicking sound started to happen whenever it was on oscillate. It made it impossible to have it on oscillate during night, so I returned it and got a different one. It looks nice and is powerful, but the clicking was unbearable.
 Not very strong, not good for a large room.  You must have the fan within 3-4 feet to feel the breeze.
 This is a very nice unit, with remote.  I like the timed feature, and the ionizer.  I really should wait to review it until I've had to clean it a few times, and learn just how long it's going to last.
 The fan motor hums so loud that I have to turn up the volume up on tv when it is turned on.
 I tried two of these, both had buzzing. Returned.
 Pros:<br/>  Very quiet, even on high<br/>  Moves a lot of air<br/>  Has a remote control<br/>  Looks great<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>  You have to point the remote right at the fan for it to work.
 It's Awesome definitely gets the job done, light weight, looks great, plenty of features. They all work lol. Remember this is a fan not an AC, so it blows the air around it. So when u have the AC on and this fan on it's even better. But that's OD. As a fan it really is relaxing.
 This is a replacement of one I had for several years.  The new one is so quiet and very efficient.  Love it.  And the tower doesn't take up so much room.  Highly recommend it.
 Excellent, top of the line.  Does everything that you can ask of a fan.
 My front room gets the afternoon and evening sun and gets very warm even with thermal curtains. I'm getting a custom solar blind put in, meanwhile this fan makes the heat tolerable
 Received item as described. Works perfectly! Thank you!
 The force of air is poor. It doesn't turn easily. I like the remote and it was easy to put together. That's about it!
 Just what I was looking for. Easy to set up too!
 Awesome fan, covers a big area, mostly quiet and ventilates very well.
 Does exactly what it's supposed to.  It's a bigger fan and moves a lot of air.  I personally find the ionizer to work very well.  I put my new hats on top of this to break them in as well, another thing it does amazingly.  I just put batteries in the remote the other day because, let's be honest, I'm not going to be that guy that needs a remote for his fan.  The remote works amazing as well, If you really need it.
 So simple to use!!!! I love this new addition to my room :) Comes with an ionizer setting also which helps keep the room smelling nice and pulls the bacteria rightr out of the air :) Thank you.
 I really like this fan as it is quiet<br/>Not a lot of cool air though but enough for my small living room
 BIG! Like a small tree trunk. 3rd gear (which is the highest) is not as high as my last Lasko tower fan which was 8 years old.<br/><br/>Again, did I say big? BIG!<br/><br/>But it works so I guess its all good.
 bought 5.  they all stopped working at the same time in less than 4 months!
 This is the best fan I've ever had. It actually blows cool air, so I don't need to us my air conditioner as much.
 This thing is great for the living room pushed plenty of air multiple settings and options. The only thing is I'm unsure if the ionizer really works though.
 Love this so much I'm buying another for myself and one for my mother.
 Lasko 2551 definitely has lived up to the good reviews that I had read prior to ordering it.  I found it easy to assemble the fan base.  It does indeed feel almost as if it is generating cool air.  This is my first tower fan and I could not be more pleased
 Awesome fan that has keep me well cooled during the summer. Assembly was quick and controls are simple.
 Excellent fan.  I love it!
 Very nice and stylish looking. Takes up very little space. Nice airflow although a little noisy.
 Love the fan, but the remote isn't working. Have tried different batteries so that is not the issue. Bought this fan because of the remote. So disappointed
 It is a really good fan, was happy to purchase it 20 dollars cheaper then a retail store with free shipping, but when i opened it, none of the screws were included in the box!!!! o well, went to the hardware store, purchased screws for 1.50 :)
 Works well! Our family is happy with its movement, and air distribution!
 I've been using this daily for about two months. It's quiet and pushes a big amount of air. If I set this about 10 feet away and have it pointed directly at me I can set the A/C to 82 and work comfortably all day. Saves me a bunch of money on A/C costs!
 Besides the fact that it looks like it was dropped due to the pig hole in the bottom of the box and the chip broken off the side, it works pretty well. Was in such desperate need of a fan I didn't want to return it.
 I have it on the whole time at home. It keeps the air flow, isn't loud, and good for sleeping. I don't use the ION.
 Expensive, but very quiet. Happy with purchase.
 Would've been great if it came with the screws for the stand
 We use this fan behind our pellet stove to move the heat out.  It works great, it is fairly quiet.
 there's not much wrong with this fan. actually its pretty much perfect - looks good, does the job well and has a remote!
 My cat was afraid of it at first idk why it's not too loud and blows cool air compared to a window this is way better.
 Quiet and moves air very well
 Not as strong as I hoped, but quiet.
 Gets the job done of circulating the air in a closed room .<br/>Air blown out is the same temperature as the weather .<br/>Cool air on cool days and hot air on hot days!
 I have been very happy with it. Thinking of actually order another one. I use it every single night by my bed.
 Great quiet fan. Use it on days when it's not super hot and it's good enough to feel chilly. Got an extra one for my mom and one for my brother.
 This fan stopped working after only 4 days of minimal usage. The fan still occilates but there is no air blowing out. Will be returning.
 Great for keeping you cool.
 Well designed and a high quality product. Very silent and performs good. Highly recommend.
 Received the fan and after two uses we started to notice a burning smell. Not sure if it is a belt inside the fan that is creating the smell. I have contacted the company several times and have not had a response as to what to do.
 Excellent product.
 excellent fan. We were very satisfied with it. We ordered another one this year for another room.
 Pure beast mode fan and fits the color scheme.  Nice wave of air while not taking up space.
 Fan works great. I bought this one to replace one that finally died after 4 years(my fault i never cleaned it). As long as you clean them once a year this fan should keep you cool for years to come.
 Wow this fan is awesome! Quiet, compact and really moves the air around.
 Works and looks great
 I highly recommend this fan. It has 3 speed, a timer, remote and the ION air purifing mode. It fits nicely into the living area space and provides plenty of air when I choose not to turn the air conditioning on yet.
 Just what I needed for upstairs. Have one in the office and another in the master. Not very audible in either room unless it's the only thing on, and even then, I find it to be pretty quiet. I leave it on when going to bed and my wife and I have no issues falling asleep.
 Great for cooling off the room and not too loud.
 My roommate already has this fan so I knew I would be very pleased with it.  It arrived in one piece and it works great.  A+++++
 The fan arrived well. looks nice. Blows little air. Not satisfactory.<br/><br/>Regret this model.
 good fan - works well, quite, takes up little space, light and all around good product
 So far so good
 good product, bad control
 It worked fine for about 25-30 days and then the buttons stopped working and now it won’t turn it on .
 like it
 Perfect for the bedroom
 The fan resistor makes a humming noise on all settings.  Instant deal breaker for me.  This is not a vibration and is most certainly component noise.  A very slight chafing noise can be heard at times, often vanishing on it's own.  I would imagine that with age and dust accumulation on the fins, it will only get worse.<br/><br/>Others have complained of the same humming issue and I wish I followed my gut.  I fell for the mantra of "It has thousands of four and five star reviews and is a #1 best seller, so the negatives are probably unusual, isolated incidents."<br/><br/>Be warned that low is still sort of a moderately loud "Medium", at least in my opinion.  Settings are more like 1. Medium 2. High 3. MAX.<br/><br/>Luckily, Amazon makes it easy to return items.
 quiet excellent breeze even feels cooler than room air, ion  feature, tall enough to give good air flow even when in high bed. sleek and light weight<br/>Only problem fan arrived with no screws to assemble. Was able to purchase four but other eight<br/><br/> size not available.  Trying to contact manufacturer.
 Loving this fan.
 Works great
 Quality fan for the price.  I love that it does not take up the space like other standing fans.  The remote feature is very handy.
 UPDATE: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, ITS HAS KNOWN CARCINOGENS<br/><br/>Why did I not see this in the User Manual?<br/><br/>CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ONLY:<br/>WARNING: This product can expose you to a chemical  or chemicals] known to the State of California to cause cancer.<br/>WARNING: This product can expose you to a chemical  or chemicals] known to the State of California to cause<br/>reproductive toxicity.<br/><br/>I purchased this fan about 5 months ago and it has been working just fine. However, I'm not able to clean the inside of the fan. I referred to the instruction manual for a guide and they suggest using a vacuum to pick up dust particles. This does NOT work! There are still dust particles floating around and essentially I've been blowing dust around my apartment for the past few months. Dust collects in the tiny, hard to get to places like the small vents in the front and back. I've spent hours with a cloth and pencil trying to dig in those small areas. Ridiculous! My biggest pet peeve is an inferior product that is not made last. If you like a clean home, do not purchase this product.
 this thing is awesome.  the best feature by far is the lack of loud beep when you press the buttons.  i also like the long pause as it swings.  it feels very sturdy and is not too loud.
 great tower fan!!, I bought it used from the Amazon Warehouse &amp; it was pretty much brand new like!!. It works great now that it's summer time.
 If you sleep with a fan for the sound, it's too quiet.  Nice style and good output of airflow.
 Awesome fan!
 Excellent fan!! It works perfectly for my bedroom. Go and buy it!! Reasonable price at Amazon...
 The fan oscillating the fan does not cover a large enough area. Otherwise it is good
 Quiet.  Works well.  I live in humid Florida, and this keeps the bathroom cooler after my shower.
 My whole family just loves this fan! It's a powerful wind machine even on the lowest setting. It's relatively quiet compared to regular fans. A big bonus is that it looks quite elegant. The only downside is that it feels a bit unsteady which I think is not a good thing if you have pets or little kids running around. But if that is not a problem, I think this fan will do it's job superbly.
 Giving 4 out of 5 stars simply because the remote clip was broken off when I went open the package to assemble the fan.  Other than that, it's working perfectly as expected.
 Works as advertised - what else can I say :-))
 I wish I had purchased a similar style but taller on a pedestal.  Unfortunately even on the highest setting it's not enough air for me.
 Good fan, when you operate the unit, but the remote broke about two weeks in.  Lasso - that really sucks.  What's the point in selling a remote operated product if the remote doesn't work?
 Love this fan - keeps the bedroom just right even with air conditioning set at higher temp.
 While it has a lot of great features this fan doesn't move enough air to be considered truly functional. I have another fan by Lasko "Lasko 4924 High Velocity Blower Fan With Handle" that has way more air pressure, but is quite a bit louder.
 Very happy with this product!
 runs 6 to 8 hrs. a day still working great after year or 2.
 looks good works great
 Worked fine for 6 weeks or so but then started to have an irritating squeak as it oscillated. Wouldn’t buy it again
 I have had another brand  of fan that was very noisy and not sturdy on carpet. This fan is perfect and has ionization also. I will be buying another for our RV. Thank you Lasko and Amazon!
 This is exactly what I wanted as it is helping me save on energy by not turning on the air conditioning.  Fits in a small space and is just perfect in the bedroom.
 I purchased 6 fans. This is best fan ever!!!
 my work had one of these last summer and it was a pure blessing.  we have a swamp cooler here, and i'm thinking that coupled with this thing we'll be more comfy
 came quickly, works well. looks pretty.
 lots of airflow from a small footprint tower.
 It is quiet and looks great.
 Needed a discrete corner fan for a bedroom that did not come equipped with a ceiling fan and purchased this based on several referrals and reviews. It pushes a substantial amount of air even on the lowest setting and works wonderfully. For me the fan has the perfect amount of "white noise" but my wife thinks its a bit too noisy. The fan operates great and the remote works surprisingly well.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with the fan is the Ionizer indicator light (which is blue) lights up the room at night. Thank you for letting me know that my air is getting purified but I would appreciate sleeping in the dark again.
 I own two of these fans, one at home and one for the office.  I love these fans, they are quiet and cover a big area.
 It is a little wobbly and was taller than I expected but it does push a good amount of air and is fairly quiet. There isn't any threat of it falling over unless you have kids or animals hanging off it.
 Best office fan I have ever purchased.  Keeps my upstairs home office nice and cool.
 super quiet and perfect for the computer room/guest room. Great find and great buy
 Excellent supplier. Just as promised and timely. Thank you, kindly.
 Excellent Product
 Very stylish and quiet!  Works Perfect. Takes up very little room.
 Works great and actually pumps out cool air when it is hot! Great buy for the price! We are thinking of purchasing more throughout the house since we don't have AC and it is a sleek profile.
 Love the fan and would recommend it.  It is 3 speed and remote operated being easy to use.
 The fan is great, but the remote is not responding properly. Have to click it a few times or just operate the fan manually. Has new batteries installed.
 This thing is amazing! Great breeze, low noise, great coverage.
 Awesome Fan, I knew this as I had purchased one about 7 years ago and it still runs well.
 I had my doubts that a tower style fan would work but this one blew me away! The oscillation and remote are great features. It's also seems pretty quiet for as much air as it moves.
 I had paid a little more for this fan because I wanted higher quality.<br/>This product worked as advertised for 16 months.<br/>A few weeks back it would ONLY rotate, whether using the remote or the button directly on the unit.  I thought I might just have to live with that, turned the fan off and went to bed.  When I got up in the morning, the FAN WAS ROTATING, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS OFF! The fan was not blowing, but even trying different rooms and plugs, it always rotates, even when off.<br/>I don't know much about electrical circuits in appliances, but this seems like a potentially dangerous product, unless one is willing to unplug it after each use!   The only "help" Lasko customer service gave me was to tell me to make sure to cut the cord before putting out in the trash.]
 These fans are stylish, unobtrusive because of their design and circulate cool air very well.  We keep one on each side of our great room all summer.
 It was super easy to assemble and it works great. I love the ion feature to freshen the air.
 Loud and loose
 Great fan , easy setup , has remote
 Everything worked as expected initially. However, the oscillation function stopped working after 5 months.
 Love it, works perfectly
 Powerful but quiet fan
 This is my third oneNd we love it!
 Not too loud
 I'm such a fan of this, it really blew me away!
 Great deal- good quality and near silent
 Looks good, works well.  The only downside is even when it's on the lowest setting It's still a bit noisy, but you can try to tune it out as white noise and eventually fall asleep.  It keeps the room cool and looks good.  Rated four stars only because of the noise, other than that, it's a good product.
 I've only had my fan for two months and it is making all sorts of noise. Almost like the motor is going out. Not a happy customer
 This is a very nice fan with good features.  Creates good breeze on warm days.
 This fan arrived with missing screws. I ended up purchasing my own because I needed to use the fan right away. It works great, however the only downfall is that its missing them. After reading some of the reviews... it's pretty common that this fan is being delivered without the screws.
 We recently moved into an apartment that has floor to ceiling windows in the bedrooms. My husband &amp; my bedroom gets more shade than our son's. His room gets a ton of sun and even with central air was getting hot &amp; humid. We wanted to install a ceiling fan for him but there was no support beam we could use. We came on Amazon to find a fan for him room. We found this incredible fan &amp; he is quite happy with it! It has adjustable speeds and a remote so that if he's in bed he can turn it off or on without having to get up. It is powerful and cools his room fantastically! We honestly could not be happier!
 I just wish it had a stronger setting
 Delivers good air flow and circulation with relatively quiet fan
 Very quiet perfect amount of air for the bedroom
 got this for my wife and she couldn't be happier
 Makes my house liveable in this awful summer heat!
 Exactly what you expect when you put in an order -- on time and great product!
 I love this! thank you!
 Excellent,light weight,low sound
 Great fan for the price, works great in our second floor where it is generally hotter like in most homes. The noise does not bother me as it hums me to sleep.
 Doesn't have the powerful fan I was hoping for. It's ok and I'll use it. But was hoping for more.
 Quiet and works great!
 Use it all the time. Works perfectly
 works very well
 Puts out a good breeze of air, I run it with my Air Conditioner. Real Happy
 The product works but it didn’t come with the required screws or batteries so I had to use my own.
 Used it all last summer. Remote is so convenient.
 This fan is incredible!  Very quite and attractive.  The remote is fantastic too.
 This particular fan works very well, and has exceeded my expectations. Has plenty of power
 Great quality just what I need
 product works just fine.. , but had huge trouble in assembling it , As they didn't send the needed screws for assembly.<br/>And none of the Lowe's or Home depot has the screws needed to assemble this fan . it needs two 8 * 3/8  and 4 , 1/2 inch M5 screws
 Great fan, amazing quality and works great.
 Relatively quiet, cools down my office very nicely.  Looks pretty sleek too - would buy again if I need another fan!
 Quiet and functional. With the remote control, it is extra convenient to adjust the speed. Like it.
 Liked the product...have been using it for over a year...have ordered one more as well. Powerful wind power across the sweep.
 I live in Miami - enough said.  This huge &amp; powerful fan moves a lot of air.  It is a wonderful fan, but be warned it is NOT small.  I love it.
 would buy again
 Great on very hot days.
 Replacement for another lasko fan which lasted me 10 years. Strongly recommend this brand
 It's being used in a bedroom for about a month now. It's not as quiet as I hoped but it does its job. The remote was a little scratched when I got it.
 This ionic fan is great love it,it really cleans the air, and there is no more musty smelling.  Has 3 speeds for the fan.
 This fan is excellent all-around.  The only negative feedback I have is the wood paneling seems a little cheesy to me (might paint it) and at first it made a kind of loud clicking-type noise when we had it on rotate, but since the first week or so it has stopped.  Overall, the remote works great and it provides the air-flow we were looking for while we sleep!
 Did  they discontinue the adjustable fans? My old fan is adjustable. I miss that.  I am going to recommend this fan nonetheless.
 This item is useless, my 12inch table fan works better. Now I have to figure out how to return item. It does not cool room the size small bedroom. I disgusted!
 Love it
 VERY SENSITIVE REMOTE . MUST BE EXACT ON LINE FOR IT TO WORK
 Love this fan! Easy to put together and it still is working to keep me nice and cool now that the weather is warmer. The base of it is a little loose but, other then that no problems. Does what is advertised.
 Nice fan!
 Great fan, quiet even on high and takes up very little space.  I have only had this for one season, so far it is the best fan I have ever owned!!!
 The tower fan works well, however it seems a bit wobbly at the base. While it's much more quite than other fans, it also doesn't create as much airflow as I had hoped for. Overall the fan is OK.
 is not that strong not sure how I feel about it yet
 Reasonable construction, vibrates more thank expected.
 Does what it says - moves the air around the room very nicely.
 Excellent, powerful fan with ion setting. It is almost too big for my small condo.
 I bought 3 and just now one has started to not osculate with out a push. As far as air movement they are very good.
 As described.
 Love this fan
 Great fan. use this fan in the lower level of my home where the a/c isnt as good as the upper part. Its sleek, quiet and it blows. Nice cooling breeze. Plus it has a remote !!!
 Very quiet, you do need to be more very close for the remote to work.
 Pretty impressed with this fan.  Great air flow
 Excellent and convenient.  Quiet and provides nice circulation.  Purchased several
 best fan ever
 Greatest fan ever!
 It was easy to assemble and keeps my FROG very cool.  Thanks.
 Love this. Works great.
 ty
 It serves it's purpose and blows a decent amount of air.  It is a little noisy in the ossilating mode which makes sleep somewhat difficult.
 This fan is so COOL!
 I love my fan so much i bought a second one for a christmas gift!
 Not a good buy the air coming from this fan can’t even move a paper.
 This fan is awesome!
 Good quality, would recommended!
 It is very strong, even on the lightest setting; not ideal for sleeping fan.
 Easy assembly. Good size and weight for easy moving around. Does its job to cool rooms nicely. That being said, right out of the box the fan makes a small whine/rattle sound, something like a computer fan whirling. And it is a bit overpriced for what's it worth, but overall a decent buy.
 This fan is SO loud!  Very unhappy with this purchase and will try to return.
 Love this fan. It will keep you cool.
 This fan is SPOT on with the reviews. It is quiet and really moves wind. It's bigger than I thought it was going to be but it's perfect to tuck into a corner of your room. That blue light though is on another level and it is the brightest thing in the room at night-- a piece of tape or a post-it note totally fixes that though!
 Works well.
 Love it!
 3 of 5<br/>Because the timer bottom stuck
 Great fan, I’ve never once regretted buying this. In fact every day I’m glad I got this.
 this fan is great! And the ION feature really clans the air.  It even made such a positive difference that my husband noticed!
 I like the 3 speed option, the fan rotate option.  Just a heads up, this is a tall fan.
 Was a lot larger than expected but it is sturdy with a solid base.  The base had to be assembled but was easy to do.  The only thing i don't like is that the oscillating range is only 90° and should be at least 180°.  Just received it today so we will see how it does.
 Gives a nice air movement.  Oscillating motion range is narrow (i'd guess about a 30 degree arc).  Works well at all three speeds.  A good value for the price since it appears well built and attractive.
 Excellent fan! Was hoping it was a tad bit more powerful but it still is a very High Velocity fan. No complaints.
 Great for summer. The timer feature is perfect for when I want to sleep cool, but wake up as the day gets warmer.
 It is so quietly efficient that I have to feel the air to see if it is turned on when I come to the room.
 Good fan. I have a tall bed and it is tall enough to give me a good breeze at night. I use all the features the timer, the ion filter the osculating fan.
 Worked great, but it's freaking HUGE!!  Look carefully at the measurements before you buy. A behemoth.
 A little noisy than I thought but great air flow
 quiet even at high speed, moves air very well. remote works from anywhere in the house.
 Decent air pressure and good sound as we like to sleep with it
 Had this model for 4 years so I bought it again. It works great. Little loud but you get used to it.
 the air from this fan is very cool and nice no noise.
 Circulates air very well, keeps A/C from running very efficiently. Bought a second now A/C runs almost half as much in summer as with regular oscilating fans.
 Great quality, and looks beautiful.
 Use it in the bathroom area as there are no vents. Works better in space than box fan and circulates air flow 100x better
 I like the low profile and my husband loves the remote.
 This fan is awful.. it barley blows any air  ... it really makes no difference.. don’t waste your money.
 Good doing business with you. Good product.
 wonderful product.  With our Ohio hot weather, I am grateful to have it.  My AC will not travel from the living room around the corner to the bedroom but my Lasko Wind Curve rotates and cools bedroom off completely.<br/>Great product.
 This fan works great. I didn’t think I’d use the remote but it’s a great add on that is very useful.
 Love this fan. Great construction for the price.
 Bought it in June, died by August. Minimal use. Fan won’t turn on just hums and makes a burning smell.
 Lasko #2554 42-Inch Wind Curve Fan with Remote great product works super gets room cooled in seconds. worth every dollar for those hot summer days.
 Decent fan, it won't be enough when you're in the afternoon heat.
 Nice fan for the price and features. The remote needs to pointed directly however. Anything off will not work.
 So far I like it...esp. the timed feature.  It is rather unsteady on carpeted floors...needs a flat surface.  Not as noisey as my other fan.  crd
 The low setting is a little too high and it makes more noise than my previous tower Lasko fan.
 Wish I bought this years back. Excellent fan. Very quiet.
 The fan is great! Well-built and have a modern look to it! It produces quiet noise and keeps the room breezy!
 Fan required little assembly, done easily.  Runs super quiet.  Don't use remote often, so I can't comment on its usability.  Use in our bedroom, and runs all night and doesn't bother us.
 It's great to have. It's nice and quiet and cools nicely.  Powerful fan. I have a Lasko heater and I love the brand.
 Broke after 12 months.
 Love it!
 purchased for work - employees like it
 Very good
 Looks Good. Quiet. Good Value.
 Nice fan meets all my needs but price a bit high I could have bought one at Costcofor about 1/2 the price.
 Easy to assemble and works well.  Good air velocity on high.  Probably will be another one.
 Nice fan, works well, keeps me cool in this hot weather we're having.
 Overall I like this fan, but one of the reasons I purchased it was that I anticipated it would be quiet.  A linear (squirrel-cage) type fan like this uses is normally quieter than an axial (conventional) fan of the same capacity.  However it sounds like there might be some resonance in the case as it is thin and there is no damping material applied to the inside.  The consequence is that the type of sound has a bit of a hollow quality to it which I, as a professional acoustical and noise control engineer, find slightly irritating even though it is not very loud.  I'm not sure how it compares to other consumer grade  tower fans - I imagine that many of them suffer from the same issue to a greater or lesser degree.
 This fan didn't come with the screws to attach the base. I would be willing to edit my review later if I could have the screws sent to me.
 Love, love, love it.  I've never been happy with a fan purchase until now.  Light weight to move when  I need to, 3 fan adjustments are perfect, it's quiet and I love having the timer on there.  And the price through Amazon allowed me to make this purchase.  Thank you.
 My only complaint would be that the Blue ION light is so bright! I had to put a piece of black tape over it in order to get to sleep at night. Other than that, it is great!
 Nice fan but not as strong as we had hoped. Quiet, but could circulate more air. Shipping was horrendous-holes in box but luckily nothing was damaged.
 Bought 2 of them!  Extremely quiet, and keeps the whole living room cool!
 I love this fan.  It is quiet.  It produces a lot of air.  The remote is great.  It looks good with the decor.  I did not notice a smell when the Ion function was used, as previously stated by others.  I plan to purchase another one for the upstairs.  The price was a good value also.
 I've had less expensive fans that cool a lot better
 this is the second one i've bought, they work great and quietly.
 East to use
 This fan has a lot of power and works very well for the price.
 Great fan! Several speeds and love the remote. It's nice as it is taller than most fans.
 So far so good, great airflow
 This is an attractive fan, but doesn't do a very good job of cooling the room. It simply isn't powerful enough. It LOOKS great, but I had to buy another fan to do the job.
 delivers cool air from circulation
 Good for your money. Quite. Good for a corner.
 Wonderful fan for bedroom on hot nights as direction can be adjusted with remote and can turn it off from bed in the night when not needed, or increase/decrease breeze.  Added benefits from neg ions are appreciated.
 This fan is amazing! I love that it has a remote control too! Works great!
 Had a Honeywell tower that wore out but on lowest setting was quiet as a whisper.  The Lasko does the job but a low setting isn't that low.
 Have it on 24/7. Works  great.
 the only complaint i have is that i wish it blew a little harder. it does a decent job of keeping my room cool even in this hot texas summer heat.
 Great fan! It does has a big footprint, but it throws a lot of air too. For the price, it was a bargain.
 Fan works fine . Remote is nice but does not push much air at all ! Easier to keep it then send it back.
 Great fan
 I can't say enough good things about this fan. I bought it because my friend had one and I liked it. My other friend bought one because I had one and he liked it. A++
 Looks good blows really good air. Only thing is that the fan itself is very flimsy and not sturdy. 2 days after plugging it in it started to become very nosy and loud. It seems to be due to it being very flimsy.
 I loved this so much I bought a 2nd one!
 It blows air.  Slow, medium and fast.
 not a very strong fan... high is just a slight flow,,,
 Love this fan!
 Very nice fan
 cools the entire room
 It has been working great for a year used most days no problems.  Nice to have timer built in.
 My husband ordered this to replace an identical one he has had for years. He loves it. He uses it every night. Great purchase.
 It is good! The fan is quiet that will not disturb me sleeping.I never try the remote control,do not know how it works but the fan is good, the wind is soft.
 Likes it for looks and works good.
 Really like this product, it actually distributes a good amount of air...
 This device produced a horrible smell when running that persisted even after letting it run.
 We just really enjoy this fan. It is quiet and works very well and doesn't take up a lot of room. Also, it looks better in the room than the regular old oscillating fan.
 Works great Easy Too build
 Great fan. Quiet and effective. However, the remote is now faulty after 1 year of minimal use...
 I have had this fan since April 2014. It worked well for the 1st year but over the past few months the fan has become very loud. There is a loud mechanical noise which makes it impossible to use at nigh while trying to sleep. While the fan worked well for a while, it broke down fairly quickly. I would not recommend for that reason.
 It is OK. Big and bulky.
 These two fans work out so well<br/>Thank you
 In family room so I would use less AC and lower my electric bills.
 This works really great but I agree with all the people who say it's impossible to clean which at some point means it will be a disposable item.  Hey diligently vacuum the entire thing every week to delay as long as possible.  It is definitely a floor model as it's way too big for any table.  Still using it this winter to move air from the gas stove into the rest of the house.<br/> Lost one star because it can't be cleaned and filters changed
 Like product.
 garbage. fan is not working.<br/>used  just one month.
 It could blow a little harder, the blue ion light is bright though.
 To bad made in china.... 100% plastic
 I love this fan it has helped me all summer to have my air conditioner a little higher. It is quiet and it has 3 speeds!
 2 years and still working great , I just use it half of the year though
 Abit pricey but a good product.
 Great product! Quiet, powerful, and cost effective. Its spring right now in Texas, so we'll see how it does in the unforgiving summer. I give it money well worth it!
 Fan works, but screws required to complete assembly were not included. I am disappointed with the product.
 It is a lifesaver in the desert!!!
 I works great just like expected.  This is my second fan of this type.
 nice fan.
 Quick shipping and works very well. Very cooling and I love the slim design. For a tower fan, it works very well to circulate the air across the room. Love how quiet it is.
 Mine is years old and still running like new.
 It is a quiet fan. The wind is gentle. The turning angle is about 90 degrees - so if you put the fan 3 ft away from the bed, the wind can cover you from head to toe.<br/>The remote control works only in a narrow angle.<br/>The wind is weaker than the Lasko floor fan I had.  In a heat wave, I have to use air-conditioning instead of the fan.
 This is our second purchase of the same fan, with the same satisfactory results. Quiet, powerful and effective.
 Easy installation and quick shipping! It blows the cool air out. It makes the room cooler. I have 2 of them. Very good fan!
 The fan isn't noisy at all but keeps my bedroom cool!
 It's been about a month and it's working like a charm! Keeping my unit cool and I love how quiet it is.
 It was just OK ...I expected more power and more angle of oscillating tower.<br/>It's a quiet fan and worth the money I paid
 I love lasko fans. Super quiet and powerful.
 I have 2 other Lasko fans that I have used for several years.  This fan is not as efficient as the older models.
 works great
 Great fan, better than a 20 dollar oscillator fan, pretty sure all the ion button does is turn on a bright blue light
 Love it worth the money
 Only complaint is that the range of oscillation could be more.
 It was a wedding gift and the recipients swear it works splendidly.
 very quite fan and it matches the decor of my office!
 Great fan. Good air flow and decent noise level. The remote works, but sometimes takes a few tries to find a good angle.
 Broke after having it only a few months
 This fan is worth the money.  It looks sleek, comes with a remote and blows a significant amount of air.  I really like all the features and it was easy to assemble the base of the unit.
 Great fan for the price!!
 My wife needs a fan at night, this one is very quite and takes care of her needs.
 nothing to dislike.
 Reasonably quiet even on high speed, powerful fan, works well.
 For the price of it, I think it is a really good product. Since I probably use it mostly at night, the fan work pretty well. Don't know about the hot summer afternoon yet. The ionize function works really good. I can see dirt in the air condense and fall on the carpet whenever I use press the ion button. Timer works really good. Did not try the remote yet. I am pretty conservative and don't rate things much, but this has met my expectation very well.
 Great fan, highly recommend.
 GREAT PRODUCT and service.
 The speed is not too great for living room of big dimension. (15X22)
 Love this fan!
 Nice fan works great.  Would give it 5 stars just a little too big.
 Nice and attractive fan with low noise just bought it to early to judge
 good
 i am satisfied with my purchase. it makes a humming noise while its on but i find it soothing. no complaints here !!
 I am thrilled with my Lasko fans.  Delivery was quick and easy and I use them every day.  These tower fans can get anywhere and are nice and quiet .
 We received it in good condition and in a timely manner.  The fan is very nice - quiet with a very nice breeze.  I am very happy with this purchase.
 Had a really weird smell when I first started using it.  Smell went away after a couple of weeks.
 This is soooooo much better than the old fashioned fans, more cooling and much quieter.  I plan on buying 2 more for this summer.
 this fan sounds cheap...it has a loud hum from the plaistic base. when i tilt it on way or another, i can make the hum quieter. if i had kept the box, i would send it back. And when I use the ion, there is a smell of something hot. For the money I spent...I am completely disappointed. Will never buy this name brand again!!!
 Very nice fan. Not too noisy but does a good amount of airflow at the highest setting.
 did not come with base screws : We are looking for the screws that should have been included in the packaging. Diagram shows the base should have 2 #8 3/8 screws and 4 M5 x 1/2 all missing. Did these not show up with any other orders people have placed?<br/> Disappointed in packaging. Unclear whether these are included in packaging,
 Product showed up at my door and the top had a major crack in it. Even the box has received a fair amount of damage.
 Love the fan. Works perfectly and is strong
 Works grt, love it!
 Excellent addition to my bedroom. Works well at all speeds.
 it's a fan
 Awesome fan, really quiet. Subs for an AC for me this summer
 Excellent fan!!!!
 love it
 great for cooling down a small room.  i mean, it is an area fan.  it works well at all speeds and it's not loud at all.
 it’s great, it blows.
 Great looking fan. Nice wood grain finish. Goes nicely with my new flooring.
 Strong and sturdy. Not too loud.
 It's quiet and doesn;t take up too much space.
 My husband and I were looking for a tower fan to put in our living room. We are trying to preserve our air conditioning to keep it from going out any day now, and this fan is great. It's powerful but quiet, and has lots of settings. We really like the remote control so we can adjust the settings right where we are.
 really pushes the air around, on high the sound is barely noticeable
 This is the first tower style fan I've tried and I'm impressed with how much wind it produces.  A standing fan taking up more space than this produces a fraction of the airflow.  Description measurements (13' x 13' x 42') are accurate.  It did have a plastic odor but that cleared up within the first day of use.  Remote works well.  Only minor gripe is the volume, but it is no louder than any other fan I've had and is certainly quieter than an air conditioner.  I got a shipping error alert by email, but it arrived exactly when predicted and in fine condition, so I figure it must have been a postal glitch.  Very satisfied.
 Unit arrived broken.
 I use it in my bedroom it keeps me cool and comfortable.
 Shipment came on time. Works great exactly what I expected.
 Great fan
 Box was damaged quite a bit but fan was undamaged and works great. Ionizer is a cool feature.
 Amazing just like amazon
 Loud Electronic Hum.  When I read the reviews of this fan, some people reported that it was loud. I decided to take a chance on it because I like its footprint on the floor. The loudness is an electronic hum that is so annoying, I had to return it. It's not a very powerful fan, but it would have been OK if the hum hadn't killed my interest in it.<br/><br/>I put back my round fan that has no hum, just a whoosh of moving air. I don't think I'll buy another fan that I can't test first.
 broken after one month of use. would not buy again.
 Quiet and perfectly good! Easy to use. Light to move.
 LOVE THIS FAN, REALLY GOOD POWER IN LARGE OPEN PLAN LIVING, DINING, KITCHEN
 This item has made our home a lot cooler without lowering the thermostat.  It is quiet and easy to operate.  Lasko 2554 42 Wind Curve Fan with Remote.<br/>Ordered from Amazon and it arrived sooner than estimated.<br/>bmw5901
 Needed a replacement fan and this one has definitely done a good job.
 Everytihing about it is great except it is too noisy. It's loud. Too loud. The fan blade is slightly rubbing on something.
 1) Takes up very little space &amp; 2) it is very quiet!  I have a small office so it was nice to find a fan that didn't take up alot of space.
 Have no complaints..easy to assemble, works great..am thinking of purchasing another.
 This fan works great. Had it for 5 months and still going strong.
 I use this fan year round. This is a replacement item. Same brand lasted over 10 years.
 Perfectly cools my living room. Love this  fan
 Fairly quiet, and cooled the room quickly
 DO NOT BUY THIS FAN. I bought two of them in May, but only used one initially until today when I pulled out the second one. When I was pulling the stuff out of the box, I noticed that the remote control looked like it was in a different bag unlike all the packaging. In addition, it didn't include batteries and the first one did. This wasn't a problem but when I turned on the fan, it made a crazy noise like the fans were banging against the plastic, i turned it off and turned it on again and is started oscillating but without any air. Since the 30 days had passed I'm out $64. I trusted the stuff amazon sells to the point that I wouldn't even try it for months but I'm done doing that plus I won't buy anything from Lasko because the fact that the packaging was different from one device to the other tells me they have no problem sending out junk, even if it's only every now and then.
 product is quiet and has a small footprint.  I use in my bedroom when temperatures are high and I need to supplement window air conditioner in main area of home.  I am able to sleep comfortably and the noise level does not cause sleep issues.
 Really nicely made, love it!
 wouldn't you know, 2 years to the date of ownership, it dies. Blows barely any air. Not worth it
 So compact and sleek with cool air and very quite too..I just love it and I am going to order more.
 No problems. Lots of options.
 Excellent fan - very quiet and keeps the entire first floor tolerable in this summer humidity and heat.
 makes noises after several uses
 I love this fan!!!!
 This fan is quiet and powerful.  A great improvement over the last fan I had.  Very pleased.
 Good unit and very nice looking.
 It blow the cool wind,no big noise .
 The product arrived just fine and was easy to assemble.  Everything worked on it, but the fan didn't deliver a lot of air.  Additionally, the fan seemed flimsy liked it was broke when you moved it back and forth.  This particular fan had a bit of a rattle to it as well.  Would be great for some spaces, but didn't like it for mine.
 Good average fan.
 No power what so ever plz don't buy u will stay sweaty all night
 QUIET AND VERY NICE.
 Horrible, horrible fan.  Ridiculously low output.
 Powerful!
 After reading the reviews I decided to buy this fan! I don't agree with what other reviewers wrote. The air quality is very poor! If you are standing very close to fan then you feel the cold air! If you stands a few feet away you can barely feel the air! Noise is not so much issue. I'm thinking returning it!
 very happy with the purchase.. really nice.
 A lot bigger than I imagined. Works well, I do really like it.
 Very very quiet. Light weight. Using it for a year and it still works great.
 Works as expected, provides great coverage.
 Remote doesn't work very well and distance is small(back and forth).
 love the fan! the remote is a little iffy!
 This fan is great! So great I purchased on for home and one for work. Quiet, simple to put together and good looking. Puts out just the right amount of air. The bonus is the remote.
 Looks so cool. Keeps me so cool. Love.
 its ok for a cheap item.  noisy and ineffective in a larger room
 This is a great fan to complement central air. I currently have the fan in my living room, and I purchased one as a gift for my parents.
 I switched from the room fan that sits up high and looks like a ferris wheel. I bought this for my Grandson, as he needs lots of circulation in his bedroom. He loves this fan and also that it has a remote control. It's also very attractive to look at and does not take up a lot of space.
 Very simple to use.  Moves plenty of air.  Very quite and looks really great!  Very responsive to the remote.  No complaints! =)<br/><br/>I used to have a regular fan that I would often forget to turn off.  The timer feature is perfect (especially since the feature is also on the remote).  I set it for 1/2 hour to an hour while i'm in the room, and if I leave it turns off for me.  Technology is great!
 This is  GREAT fan.  I keep this in the doorway of the room in which I have a big air conditioner and it pushes the cold air from the living room to the rest of the downstairs.  Works quietly and really does a great job.  Very happy with this purchase!
 Nice fan. Great design and worked great throughout the summer.
 A little unstable on the carpet when pushing the buttons.  Blows a lot of air and turning radius is spot on.
 I love this fan. I am a fan of the Lasko (pun intended). I have one of these at work and so I knew it was good, but I didn't realize how much I needed it until I got one for my bedroom. It sounds nice, it looks great, it works like a beast. It's not too strong or loud, but it does a great job of moving the air around and keeping things cool.
 awesome, great breeze feeling
 If I could give less then one star I would. It lasted TWO NIGHTS! And that wasn't even using it the whole night. I would not recommend this product to anyone!
 Great addition to filter the room
 I live in a basement apartment in DC and this fan is so good that I don't have to use air conditioning in the summer! Seriously amazing!
 Solid fan, best I've owned. Easy to assemble with no tools and I love the remote. Truly saved me from a hot summer
 Love the fan. We purchased this to replace a smaller fan that just wasn't doing the job. This summer has been especially hot and our screened-in Florida room was getting way too stuffy to enjoy. This fan makes the whole seating area comfortable to enjoy even during the warmest days, is quiet so as not to distract from watching the TV or carry on a conversation, and it doesn't hurt that it has the filter on it to make the air fresh. You won't be disappointed.
 Wish the width of the panning could be adjusted.
 Love this fan. Has remote..stationary for moves. We have one in bedroom and one in den! Highly recommend.
 Great Fan, High Air Volume. Excellent
 It's really an underwhelming fan. Not enough power. Not bad looking but it needs more oomph.
 Is very good...!!!
 Love my Lasko!  It's quiet and most importantly, it's safe around my toddler grandson.  Although it has helped cool down whatever room we have it in, it doesn't cool as much as I had hoped.  I still consider it a good purchase and am considering buying another one.  I would recommend it to anyone.
 Excellent fan; great airflow, and hasn't given me any issues in the past 18 months that I have been using it. Would recommend and buy again!
 This fan is a bit noisy. I'm not sure if mine is defective but it has a loud buzz to it that is a little annoying. When the ionizer is on at night, I could use the damn thing as a reading lamp or consider landing airplanes in my room (it's needlessly bright).
 This was a replacement for a 8 year old Lasko 2551 Tower Fan. - Very quite
 Love this fan. Works great and has a remote with timer
 I got this fan to help circulate some of the air around the house and also to help clean some of the pet smells from my two dogs. It's been a great little fan. The low setting is extremely quiet. I rarely use it on anything higher but the noise does increase, but is tolerable. I have this fan right beside the TV and it's never loud enough to require an increase in volume.
 Not only does it help cool off my third floor bedroom but the white noise helps me sleep like a baby!
 Just plain awesome. Moves the air nicely and is very attractive.
 This is a great fan. Quiet, nice looking, covers the area of a whole room. I have left running all day and night and it keeps going strong.
 Second one of these..they are a great product.
 The lasko fan is wonderful. It's quiet and it works perfectly.
 More quiet and light compared to my last 48" Lasko fan.  Like it so much, I bought another for downstairs.
 Bought 2 of these for an art studio... worked out great...
 I had to spray silicone down at the base where it rotates on the oscilate setting to get rid of noise.  Otherwise a good fan.
 simple and good air
 Not worthy for that price. I don’t like this from the day 1
 Extremely happy with my purchase.
 Great product.
 Works so well that I have two of them! Timer, Ion for air "cleaning" and oscillation are real nice "extras" for a room fan.
 Packaging was old rugged torn plastered. Broken and fan string were peeking out the vent.
 Works great, remotes a little finicky but I like it over all
 Well made, nice remote, and does a great job at cooling down the room.
 Great fan.  Ordering another one for another room. Very sleek design and very quiet.  Feels like a mini ac unit.
 Fan works great!
 Love it.
 Very , very quiet &amp; does a great job of cooling.
 Picked thus from many like it randomly from Amazon and have been very happy with it. I definitely recommend it.
 The fan got "possessed" about 2 weeks after we purchased it. Turns on and off at random. Sometimes you try to turn it off, and it keeps going. Only way is to unplug it from the wall. Sometimes it just turns on by itself. I'm sure its a defective unit, but be aware, wiring quality is not good.
 I bought it for its rated quiet.  It really isn't quiet at all and when rotating, the fans make a warble.
 Works great! Dropped a star because it's a bit louder than I hoped, and the turn radius isn't all that great.
 Loud rattling right out of the box. Not worth the effort.
 My husband and I love this Laszlo fan. We bought this fan to replace a tower fan we had for t years. Love the rich wood trim.matches our furniture.
 it works well and does the job…little cumbersome
 Awesome fan! We live in Hawaii and this fan is all we need for our living room.
 Love it! Works great! Arrived quickly.
 This is the best fan we've ever had. We had one a few years ago (this same one) and used it for years constantly and loved it. Then we moved to a place downtown that was small with forced air and we didn't really need it so we gave it away. We moved since then and wanted a fan again. We repurchased it and it works just as great as our old one. We are major Lasko fans now (pun intended)! This model in particular works better than others. We got a lasko tower fan from Home Depot and it does not have the same windpower or quality that this one has. I also love the burled walnut look!
 Great price. Purchase from my bathroom when I blow dry my hair. Works perfect.
 Got two for a family visit and they performed wonderfully.  Glad I got'em.
 bought one then bought another!
 Very weak. Barely blows air.
 Love the fan and I love the remote control feature on it.
 works
 I've had this fan for about 7 months now and it's still running great.
 Stylish and great air
 Really good we love it now and my fiance wants a another one now
 Works good
 I purchased this unit on June 3rd and as of today (July 7th) it makes the most terrible sounds. It cools, but the noise started up a few nights ago, just after the 30-day return time expired. As the unit runs, the noise gets worse and I cannot sleep with the unit on most of the time given the noise. Now I am stuck with a fan that I am sure is going to either burn my house down or break completely. When I turn it off, it makes the most terrible sound, almost like it's not aligned or put together correctly inside.
 Package was damaged and there's a big scratch on the fan body. The fan seems to be working though.
 I was recommended to buy this fan by a neighbor. Works well, the oscillation and and fresh air ionizer plus a remote control works exactly as described.
 Works very well.  We have purchased 3 for our two homes over the last 18 months and have been very pleased with all of them.
 The fan doesn't blow as hard as I had hoped and stand wasn't easy to install. The overall quality is good
 I've owned this for years, and use it both as a fan and just at night to have a little noise so I can sleep. It works without issue, 8 hours a night, every night. Takes up very little floor space, simple assembly. Definitely recommended if you want a fan you can buy and not have to think about.
 I just waste my money. Air speed is too low.
 Great fan!
 This is the perfect solution to cool my small porch. I like the rotating feature and fan settings. It arrived promptly.
 Best fan ever, should have bought it sooner.
 ok
 quiet and air feels great circulating
 Nice fan, expected to be a little less noisy but it works great
 Good
 This is cheaper on Amazon than buying at Walmart or Lowes.  This is a well made fan that does the job.  Super quiet.  A good buy.
 Nice, solid and large fan. I expected the wind it generates to be a bit stronger than it is and actually would prefer that. Otherwise it is a well priced fan for its class.
 Goiod! I thought the high speed wasn't that high! It cools
 worked as expected, great!
 Would not recommend, the fan makes a lot of noises when on and literally shakes and wobbles. Wish I could have returned it in time but missed out.
 amazing product and works amazing for me
 Great fan!! Little noise, more like white noise. I love the timer &amp; the remote.
 Just exactly what we needed and wanted. My boss loves the remote control feature!
 Fan puts out a ton of air.
 My best fan. I need this.
 Works almost a little too well. The lowest setting is actually pretty high. I wish there was a bit more variability in the power output settings.
 Works great, love the size. Pretty quiet for a fan. No problems 6 months later.
 Thumb screws are missing for base assembly! ☹
 It hardly blows any air out
 Super quite. Just what we needed.
 Made very nice, I love the remote control, three settings are great. Is perfect for what I wanted it for.
 I love this fan.  It comes with a remote control so you can turn it on without getting out of bed or if you get cold you can turn it off without getting out of bed and standing in front of it while you turn it off.
 Excellent fan. Gives Dyson a real run for your money.
 I love this fan! It is the quietest fan I have used in a long time! I am a teacher and my classroom is SO HOT and the one fan I had in there just wasn't cutting it. This fan will definitely help circulate the air around the room and help cool it down!
 Nice fan. Not to powerful, but very versatile
 Horrible fan, very very weak!!!! Did not like this fan at all, blows very soft would not recommend to anyone
 Buying a second one
 Loved this product so much, I bought 2 of them!
 this fan has been great to move air in a an office environment with stagnant, mildewy air.<br/>it has helped a lot.<br/>It runs quietly enough to not be disruptive.
 This fan working very good
 what i saw was what igot. good. Works fine till now.
 Good airflow, quiet operation.
 Works well, relatively quiet as well.
 great fan. works well and is well made.  This is the second one that I bought.
 Wish it had more speeds. Great fan other wise
 works relatively quiet
 First day or 2 were ok but now it just makes it smell like there's and electrical fire going in my house every time I turn it on. The smell is unbearable.
 This fan is a lot taller than expected.  It moves a lot of air and we are happy with our purchase.
 Fantastic!
 Awesome powerful fan.  Can move air 20 feet away.
 fast shipping,love the 3 speeds, and best is the timer. thanks
 the fan works fine but not the remote. it works but sometimes (most of the time) i have to click it 4/5 times for it to activate. once it does activate it seems to be okay for further changes. anyhow i bought it for the fan operation and it works fine. so gave it a 4
 Great fan.  Would buy again.
 wonderful, I don't know how I lived without it, really cut down by use of AC this summer
 It worked for just under an hour. The fan was on the lowest setting and I know for a fact that timer was not on. Fan just stopped working light turned off and would not turn back on. Was really hopeful especially after read all the great reviews and how sleek the fan looks.
 as advertised, timely delivery
 No complaints this fan works very well and functions as described.
 Worked well while I had it, but just stopped working and won’t turn back on
 Works great!
 Very nice fan.
 Liked it so much that I bought another one even though it cost more.
 Purchased two for my house. They really do keep my living room nice and breezy. I highly recommend for cooling a room.
 The fan is very easy to assemble on its base and the remote control comes in handy. No complaints, happy so far with it. Delivery was on time.
 I love it!!! Works perfect for me
 I have had this fan for a week, it already has an annoying clicking sound whenever it is running...do better Lasko.
 The fan arrived quickly, and putting it together was very simple, just a few screws here and there. I really like it, it looks nice in my living room, much better than a regular fan. They only problem I have is that it is slightly louder than other tower fans I have owned in the past, but not significantly so. The slot in the back of the fan to store the remote is handy.
 It does what  it needs to do and doesn't take up as much  room as the old style fan.
 A quiet, strong fan, which was exactly what I needed, Delivery was extremely quick, too. I would recommend it without reservation.
 Top heavy and not stable but cools the small room just fine.
 Works great, only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is bc it's a little bulkier than my last fan... Would have liked a slimmer design. The noise level is fine, blue light that shines is a little bright though... Overall satisfied.
 Great fan, though quite large (I neglected to look at the description). I love all it's features and it cools off a large room.
 Good fan, but not quiet. Easy to put together. Cools the room off.
 We used it all summer and it worked flawlessly.
 Works very well for small room and remote feature is handy.
 Great product.  Looks great, works great, wonderfully quiet.  Totally recommend it.
 Cools a room but it's very large. Bigger than expected.
 It is a great fan!
 Cools of my entire living room!
 I am a fan of this fan.
 Air coming is very slow speed, useless.
 Does not oscillate far enough around
 Awsome! Quiet, has all the bells and whistles you would need.
 Bought one previously and was very happy with it, ordered this one and it will only turn on/off using the remote
 Great fan, very pleased with transaction.
 I love this fan! It circulated the air very well!! Definitely would recommend it!
 A little over a month after I purchased this fan, the oscillation broke. Unfortunately, it was after the 30-day return policy.
 Great fan. It cools a room quickly. Sitting here on a 90 degree day in Central Oregon with no a/c yet feeling great.
 Bought this for the upstairs in our large foyer to help with the poor circulation in that area.  Quieter than I thought at the highest speed and really moves the air. Works great and blue light acts as a night light. My only complaint would be the turning radius is limited. Not even 90 degrees.
 Great fan makes the room much cooler with it in the corner. I like the icon feature
 Great
 Slightly noisier than reviews suggested
 Works okay, connection to base is kind of flimsy, worst part is that it puts off funky/burning smell after only a couple minutes of use. The smell started after only a month or two of lite use.  I should have used it more right after buying, too late to return.
 Very good product
 Works great!! I mainly bought it for white noise when I sleep but it puts out great air flow as well. Hopefully it will last longer than my other fan.
 very good fan just a little over priced
 It was exacctly what i ordered very light and the base at first was i thought rocky but after re putting it back together since yep it is a little confusing it fits perfectly
 Amazing. Does everything I wanted it to do with no issues.
 Worked great for almost 6 months then stopped being able to oscillate.
 A great fan for the price. Its quiet, the air is cool, and I love the remote!
 remote did not work with 3 sets of batteries
 Luv it!
 Variable speeds, timer, This is a great buy.
 Tis quiet and so far it keeps on going. good for circulating the air and it has the ION. I have had good luck with the Lasko fans.
 Does the work. A bit noisier than I expected thought. It's stylish. The remote does not work from a few feet far.
 This is a nice fan, its sturdy, works well and I'm happy with it.
 During a heat wave and my window a/c is working over time, this little unit helped me sleep. It's very quiet and blows cool air. Doesn't take up any room at all.
 Super cool breeze and works very well.
 I suppose this fan performs as intended however it puts off a terrible stench that smells like a hot car engine. It really smells like something is burning. I suppose this is a defect. Also the remote only works about 50% of the time. You must hit buttons multiple times to get them to function. The fan gives a nice breeze and is very sleek, however I will probably only use it in an outdoor capacity. The burning smell is to much for a small bedroom, which it was intended for.
 we love it!! only thing is it was delivered to my next door neighbour, lucky for me i have an awesome neighbour. Do recommend this product.
 perfect fan to have, works well
 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000RL3UJA/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0<br/><br/>. Controls did not work after 6 months.
 We love it!! its a great fan to have in the office. the air in here feels cooler and fresh. It works great, we can set it to turn off automatically, which is useful, since sometimes we may walk out of the office forgetting to shut it off. Our office has no windows and we needed a fan/filter to clean our air and take away the stuffiness, and that's exactly what it did. Feels great to breath in here. :)
 Pretty effective, but Very noisy. It's got a pretty good radius of cooling, but is insanely noisy and doesn't oscillate much.
 Works great, bigger then I expected which is nice. Not too loud at all. Yes, the blue light is annoying at night but it can easily be turned off if you want
 Live this fan! On my third one!
 The fan is vey nice. Attractive and quiet. With any fan like this,  you will get a little noise.This is to be expected, but this fan is very quiet. It was delivered by the post office. The box had obviously been dropped of thrown or both. It was re-taped on one end and when I opened it, the styrofoam on the top end of the fan was cracked in half.<br/>In spite of that, the fan seems to be working well, But again, I must tell Amazon, not to ship me anything by the USPS as the lose, destroy,damage or ruin almost everything. They may be low in price, but we are the ones paying for it in lost time when having to return something they damaged. And it has happened more than once.
 The Lasko tower fan works well for my studio. It cools the area sufficiently even in the lowest setting. I hardly use the remote, and it is tucked away in the back, so I hardly miss it. For the price, I think it is a great value and helps to reduce my energy bill.
 Had it for a while now and use it every night. Baby's still running strong.
 as good as an air conditioner
 I just received this fan and while it looks nice, I can't comment right now on how it functions, since all the screws to put it together are missing from the package.  I called Lasko customer support and they are sending me more (to arrive in approximately 5-7 business days, sigh).  When I get them, and can assemble and use the fan, I'll update this to a more functional review, but I want to warn others that this is a possibility.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  the replacement bits arrived as promised, and the fan works exactly as described.  I'll bump up the stars to reflect this.
 This is my second Lasko fan that has rattled. It doesn't matter if it is oscillating or standing still. It's loud enough to keep you awake.
 I am not a fan of this fan. I will be returning it. I had previously bought the Honeywell and thought those were terrific however the reviews for this last go persuaded me to buy one.  I am very disappointed is it doesn't seem to move the air as well as the Honeywell brand. I'm not sure if I have a defective one or it's just this bad but it will be going back I am not sure how it has so many stars and positive reviews.  In the meantime I already purchased another Honeywell it has arrived and it is just as good as the last one I bought. The Honeywells truly move the air and almost feels like an air conditioner rather then a fan and this Lasko is not even a fan in my opinion.
 love it...... it's very quiet
 Great fan. It's quite and sufficiently cools my bedroom. I love the remote.
 Nice fan.
 I thought it would be way colder.
 as expected
 perfect
 Blows a lot of air. Very cool.
 Works very well. Does have a slight hum but it's barely noticeable. Works great for my small bedroom. Would buy again.
 Works well, quiet for my office when I am on the phone.
 Good fan.
 We put this in our bedroom, and it works so well! Nice quite, rotating fan with ION air purifier. A must for a bedroom!
 Great fan. Love the oscillation. And it's quiet.
 Amazing.  Keeps my room cool.
 After only 4 months this fan stopped working when we needed it most, post hurricane Irma with no A/C, very disappointed.
 The speed is not high enough.
 good fan.  have had it for more than a year now.
 The fan is taller than I expected which is good. It sits next to my desk and I used it every day.
 This product worked well and then died after almost 2 years. Very unfortunate since it worked well for that time. All of my other fans have worked for 5+ years with no problem, this is the only one with the issue.
 Very powerful yet quiet.
 Great fan!  It has many of the features you would expect to find on a fan that cost much more.  I like that it's very quiet! We use it in our master bedroom so it is very convenient. We set the electronic timer so it will shut down at night and the  remote control will operate all the fans functions!
 Loved this so much we bought a second one for the bedroom.
 Awful... fan speed too low. Maximum output is zero.
 Pushes a good amount of air.  The mounting screws to attach the base didn't come in the box.  The Ion breeze function is a gimmick.
 Works great
 Runs good, and throws out a lot of air. Rather quiet.
 plenty of wind verrrry quiet
 Bought for my bedroom. Perfect air distribution thus I bought 1 more for my living room.
 Just what we were looking for.
 I NEED to fall asleep to the sound of the fan. It's not too quiet, not too loud. Great buy!
 Works well.  Does what it's supposed to do.
 I bought this fan when my ac was broken. It has a strong breeze and it's pretty quiet even at high speed. My biggest problem with it was that batteries weren't included with the remote. Nowhere did I read that the batteries weren't included, so that was irritating.
 I can sleep again.  Cool and quiet.
 This fan is nice. Blows you away....I mean I was surprised by the blowing velocity. Also I felt the cool air out of it. This may be psycological but atleast I didnt feel the warm air re-circulating. Wish it swiveled a bit further.
 Best fan I've bought. Highly recommend.
 Great fan!!  I use this in my office it is very quiet and professional looking!  Love it!
 Oh my, has been a lifesaver this hot summer. It helps a lot. Not too noises.
 Great fan cools oif room quiet
 My experience with the Lasko #2554 has been good. It has been a work horse with continuous use for 3 weeks now. I just bought a third #2554 yesterday. The quiet soothing sound moves air efficiently reducing the stress of my main HVAC system. The size shape and blending appearance make you feel you have added a major furniture purchase to the room.
 good fan
 Amazing fan.  Sleek and powerful.  Perfect for apartments.
 quiet and cooling.........
 I purchased this fan from amazon. It is the best fan i have ever used. At home we call it mini AC its so effective.
 Excellent.
 The fan is sturdy enough and creates enough cool air to cool a small room. But like the other reviews, the remote DOES NOT WORK. At all.<br/><br/>I've tried several batteries, getting right up in it, trying every angle. It doesn't work. So if you're ok with going up to change the setting, I recommend this fan. But the remote is a waste of plastic.
 Worst fan, no powerful air of any sorts.  Poor selection.
 It’s quiet and looks nice
 Minimal assembly required with 6 bolts to setup the base.  Don't do what I did and attach it backwards the first time.  Read the instructions and you will be fine.<br/><br/>Quiet fan with great airflow.  I agree with the reviewers that mention the narrow oscillation range, however it is more than adequate for  our family room.<br/><br/>Remote is nice, especially that it stores within the fan housing.  Overall we are very satisfied with the purchase.
 I purchased particularly for my kid and she loving it, In the hot summer days so much needed the fan.<br/>Highly recommend to any new buyer no installment hassles. In the past purchased Honeywell and installation of the base is horrible and some small plastic piece is broke and not able fix anything.<br/>Loving this Lasko Product!!!
 Fan makes a loud rumbling noise that makes it hard to sleep or focus while working. Disappointed in my purchase.
 Love these fans. Great cooling and not too loud. We have one for every room.
 Does the job, but we hear a little clicking sound as it moves back and forth.
 Just what I needed.
 So much better than the old style fans...this works GREAT.
 Runs very quiet and easy to put together. Blows a lot of air.
 Excellent
 Quality product and decent price
 The remote is wonderful.  I have it in my bedroom and it is tall enough to go over the top of the bed to cool me off when it gets warm.  I have only had it about a month but it is great.  It is quiet but not whisper quiet.  One more lower speed would probably do the trick but the way it is, it is like white noise.  It is still not as noisy as the air conditioner coming thru the vent.
 Love it and want to buy another one.
 Makes a lot of noise. Especially when turning around
 a great fan and well made
 Didn't put out as much air as I thought it would so am rating it in the middle.
 Amazingly quiet and beautiful.
 I have been using this fan to push heat from my pellet stove to the rest of the house, and it has done a great job so far.  It moves a lot of air,and it is very quiet. I have noticed it start to make that "clicking" sound every once in a while but since its not in the room I sleep in, it doesn't bother me.  The other thing I would mention is that it arrived here really fast, I think I had it here in 2 days.
 I don't write reviews. I read them, but I never write them. But this fan is great, so I'm writing one. The fan is powerful but quiet, which is exactly what I was looking for.  I really appreciated others' reviews that said the same. The fan easily cools down a single room and helps with circulation. I can still easily listen to the TV or music while it's running.
 Great fan.  Takes up so little space.  Cools the entire living room.
 Excellent!!
 Fan is great. Small and quite.
 Same base parts were sent instead of 2
 Nice design... Compact and looks good... Blends nicely with the décor. Works Great! The multi-function remote control is very convenient.
 I like these fans, ordered 2 of them
 Works great. Quiet. love the ION and remote features!
 I like it so far.
 Really like this fan, it's not powerful but does the job.
 it has all the bells and whistle that one of these fans can have but it has a funny smell and I am hoping it goes away with use. So far that has not happened
 Works perfectly. Looks cool too. Solid build.
 It's a great fan
 Sometimes it doesn't turn on and when it does it cuts off within 10 minutes
 What joker is in charge of quality control? I got the fan sans screws required to mount it onto the base. "No problem", I thought; the manual says to screw in #8 x 3/8" screws, so I purchased those. Did they fit into the screw holes? Of course not.<br/><br/> Additionally, something would rattle inside the fan whenever I moved it. After 10 minutes of shaking, I managed to shake out a screw. Unfortunately, this was also of the wrong size to screw in the base.<br/><br/>The fan itself is actually pretty nice; it's audible but more than quiet enough for my needs and blows enough air even at the lowest setting to keep me cool in a warm room here in sunny SoCal. At the highest setting it actually dries my eyes out if I sit within a 6 foot radius. Unfortunately, we rate for the overall experience and the care given to QC is very sub-par, as judged by many other reviews which report a similar issue.
 Just a little bit
 Not much else to say, really.  It works well for what it does, isn't overly loud, and it has a remote so you don't need to get up during those hot summer days.  Also has a timer so you can set it for anywhere from 30 minutes to 7 hours and 30 minutes, which is pretty cool if you don't want to have it running all night when you sleep.
 It's quiet, takes up little space, powerful breeze, and I just have it on the #2 setting. It serves it's purpose perfectly for helping cool down my 10'x14' room
 Exceeds Expectations
 It works well  if you are in close proximity to it.
 This fan is the best I have purchased since my other went out. Nothing like quiet blowing air while listening to your TV.
 I love it.  Has a lot of air flow and it's not too loud.  The light is pretty bright but it doesn't bother me.
 So far so good! Been running it 24/7.
 Great fan
 Very large, wobbly and very loud. I sent it back.
 Works as advertised and is very quiet.
 Takes up little space and really cools off the place.
 Great product and it cools my room quickly. Thanks for all previous reviews which help me to select this item.
 Very happy with the fan. Easy to assemble, cools well, easy to operate, and quiet. Would recommend.
 Slow speed is way to fast
 Bought two fans.  One of the fans worked for only 8 months.
 Powerful.
 It was a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be, which was great! Circulates air really well. You can feel it from all the way across the room, probably a 12-15 foot distance away. Also has an air purifier button.
 The fan looks nice and is good value. There are others out that that cost a little more that put out more air, but this works well moving the air around in my 500 sq ft basement living room.
 DID'T DISLIKE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS FAN.
 Even though fan has 3 speed levels, it is not giving good amount of air. I disappointed very much about this.
 Arrived yesterday, was great for 3 hours-- super silent, but then, out of no where started to rattle. Keeps making rattling noise.
 Very nice.  Moves a lot of air.  Low setting quiet enough to sleep with while still moving enough air to keep you cool.  Remote works great as well.
 The fan is quiet and gives out a lot of cool air.  The timer is wonderful at night so it shuts off after a few hours and then the cool night takes over.  It does not take up a lot of room and looks nice.  I am very pleased with this product.
 Works ok
 I use my fan all year long and this fan is great. I like that it has a remote control and it is very quiet. I would buy this fan again!!!!!
 Was as shown A++
 nice fan, works great, nice features
 wouldn't want to live without it
 Works well and my son can’t get his fingers in it which is a huge plus!
 What a great fan!<br/>I live in Texas, I spend a great deal of time in the garage so even if the room is HOT, all the air flowing out of the fan feels cool, it is so refreshing even with the ionizer.<br/>Definitely, recommend this fan to anyone, the remote control is a big plus.
 works great, nice and quite
 Great fan. It moves lots of air.
 great
 Broke in 4 days
 I love it!
 Its okay.
 Bought it for the main living area - fairly stylish but more importantly it's quiet, and efficient. Easy to assemble and the remote gives you speed, timer and rotation. Good value.
 As promised.
 Cool air with almost no sound. With remote you can control oscillation
 I am a 47-year-old woman suffering from hot flashes.  I almost always have a large blue ice block with me wherever I go.  When I watch TV, I have one behind my back, I'm so hot.  Even with a ceiling fan, I can't seem to get relief.  I did an extensive search on Amazon to find the perfect fan and THIS IS IT!!!!  I love the slim-line design, I love that it comes with a remote, I love that you can move it easily, but most of all I love it because I'M NOT HOT anymore!  I would have gladly paid twice as much for this fan, but it was very reasonably priced.  The air that comes out of this fan almost feels like air conditioning!  Sometimes I get cooled down enough that I can turn it off for about an hour and then turn it back on for a few minutes to get cooled off again.  Don't hesitate to buy this fan--you'll be glad you did!!
 Product is everything and more! I love having the remote so that I don't have to get up  since I'm lazy.
 I love it! It is very quiet and does exactly what I thought it would do. I went through all the reviews before buying this and am extremely satisfied with it. I will definitely be getting another one to cover more area.
 Oscillation range is short however on high power this fan is extremely quiet.
 Tall, quiet fan that circulates well. The remote and timer add to the convenience of its use. It is not an air conditioner!!!
 The fan arrived as described, though the box was in very poor shape, very badly beaten up. Also, the screws needed to fix the base to the fan was missing, so I will have to purchase them separately. Other than that, it is a very good fan, cools the air as described.
 Amazing great range quiet and cools the whole room!
 it's okay.  It pushes enough air around to get a nice breeze, but the fan only rotates about 45 degrees, I wish it oscillated in a wider area.
 It works really good
 Good fan for the price. Fits perfectly in my small bedroom. Only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is that it's a bit louder than I anticipated, but nonetheless a very good product.
 DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO, GOOD AMOUNT OF AIR MOVEMENT ON LOW AND EXTREMELY QUIET
 Excellent product, better than expected.  We use them in our church and look great and are very quiet
 Very disappointed that I was not able to replace this fan. The speed setting button was broke, and they said I would have to get a refund which I did not want, I simply wanted to replace it.
 Wish the remote came with batteries but is otherwise great.
 Wish the fan speed was higher
 I loooooove this fan!! Its really quite and it does really blow cold air when i have no idea how it finds it! Now i can finally use a blanket again so i would definitely recommend this fan to anybody. It may be a little pricey but its so worth it!
 This never worked at all.
 Better than expected and my expectations were high.
 Quiet and easy to place is small spaces. Great air rotation. It now has a permanent spot in our kitchen! Thanks!
 Beautiful design, works perfectly and easy to assemble (base only).  I would definitely buy this again!
 Love it love it. So quiet sleep with comfort
 Worked great for 2 months but suddenly stopped working.
 Clicks when it turns.  My first Lasko fan did not do that.
 All my Lasko brand fans stop working and my hubby has to rewire the cords to get them to work.
 I got this fan in September and it's December and it's already not working. 3 months and the motor just gave out.
 Works well. Not as quite as mentioned.
 It is a good fan and runs well. It is a little weak though
 On time good quality
 Stopped working after 4 months of using it. Not impressed or happy with this product
 It's very silent and eficient
 everything fine
 Great fan. Works well, very quiet. Good value!
 Fan works like a charm. It's slim, quiet and effective.
 Performs as advertised. Its not very quiet which may bother some people, but for me that sound is very soothing. It looks very nice. Only complaint is that the maximum speed is not as high. Still very much recommended.
 Very nice fan.  Very nice price!
 I bought this fan and I am completely satisfied with the performance so far.  Nice amount of air flow with minimal amount of corresponding noise.<br/><br/>The timer is also a nice feature.  I set it to turn off the fan an hour after I put my head on the pillow.
 Great fan
 I use this in my home office and it does a great job of keeping the air flowing on hot days. While no substitute for an air conditioner, I've been able to endure some of this aggressive heat from New York's earlier and crueler than usual summer.<br/><br/>It's quiet even while oscillating, has multiple modes, a sleep timer, has a built in ionizer (though I can't tell you how well it works since I have no need for one), and it's big enough to flow air in a small room. I definitely recommend it!
 This fan really cools a room.  I can leave the A/C on a high setting and feel comfortable running the fan.
 I loved the last two that I bought two more.
 Very well made and cools the room down on hot days!
 Great
 A little louder than other lasko models but works well.
 I use it very often and love it, silence and neat
 Good value
 This fan is terrible! The fan is buzzing and humming as the fan turns after 2 months of purchase!! Not worth the money.
 It is a little bit lound fan noise at the maximum #3  fan speed .
 Fan works great. Air is cold, and it is very quiet.
 Purchased in May 2016 and today it has stopped working.  It is under limited warranty,  so we'll try that route.
 Fan was ok at first. Stopped rotating after about 3 weeks. Completely stopped working, 2 months after receiving it.
 kinda bulky but works great
 Low speed a bit strong.
 Love that it comes with a remote control. It keeps me pretty cool in the summer.
 My bedroom would stay so hot I would have to put the AC to 68 to be able to sleep, then the rest of the house would be ice cold!. Now I keep the thermostat on 72, and sleep like a baby. Great product, Great price!
 Silent. Great quality.
 Excellent
 FRESH AIR, CLEAN AIR
 Puts out nice air flow but it's a little unstable.
 A bit noisy when first turned on otherwise excellent fan.  My second one.
 great fan, have has it for a couple years and still works great.
 This fan works very well and moves a decent volume of air.  The ionizing feature is nice, I guess, but I can't really tell the difference between regular air and "ionized" air.  It is fairly quiet and does not make any rattling or grinding noises.  It's been running nearly non-stop in my house for about 2 months without a hiccup.  I do wish the base of the fan was a bit heavier.  I've knocked it over several times with a light bump because it is top-heavy.  To be fair the fan itself is not very heavy - maybe 5 lbs total.  The remote works well, when I can find it.  .
 Excellent product. This fan takes up very little space. It moves a lot of air, and when using the ion feature, freshens the air.
 Witthin just a couple uses it developed a rattle.  Very irritating.
 It doesn't blow much wind. Unsatisfied with this product. Costs way too much for what it does.
 My apartment sadly doesn't have cooling and with the hot summer going on, I decided to buy this to help keep me cool. It's overall been a great product that I've been using daily with no issues so far.<br/><br/>I actually found a surprising amount of convenience with the remote it comes with. I use the remote for when I have guests and have to place the fan in a more centralized location to cool everyone down. You can control every feature on the fan with this remote, so it's been surprisingly handy for times when my fan is across the room from my desk and I want to turn it on, change fan speed, oscillate, and etc.<br/><br/>The three fan speeds are adequate. My apartment has a 500 square foot main room and I can feel a nice wind from the fan on setting 3 when seated in the opposite corner of the room. Setting 2 can still push air across the room, I only use it for the miraculous days that don't break 85+ degrees. And setting 1 is perfect for having the fan near you and is the speed I usually always have it set to.<br/><br/>I have no idea if the Ionizer really does anything. I don't have pets, don't smoke, and I don't live in a busy city so I haven't noticed any difference in the quality of air. But I leave it on all the time when the fan is running anyway because I actually like the little blue light that comes on haha.<br/><br/>It also has timer settings from 0.5hr to 7.5hrs, in half hour increments, but I keep the fan running at all times when I'm home so I never used this feature. Cycling through the timers is kind of annoying because there are 15 possible combinations when setting the timer which you cycle through by pressing one button. So if you miss the time you want or accidentally turn the timer on when you didn't mean to, you have to cycle through every combination until you get back to the one you wanted. Kind of annoying, but I don't use the timer so it doesn't bother me personally.<br/><br/>Overall build quality of the fan is decent. It's all plastic and does require a little bit of construction out of the box. The only construction is just a few screws which secure the base to the fan - super easy. The plastic and construction does feel a bit on the cheaper side. Even with the screws tightened down, the tower does still have some wobble if I bump into the fan or am operating the buttons on the fan itself. But it does not wobble, creak, or anything when oscillating so again, I don't mind. The only time I even touch the fan is when I'm relocating it for guests.<br/><br/>Lastly, like I said earlier, I leave this fan on constantly when I'm home - in setting 1 when I'm alone and setting 3 when guests are over. Despite this, its "power consumption footprint" is so small that I do not notice it when paying my power bill. Of course, it is just a fan so I wouldn't expect it to raise my power bill more than a couple of dollars, but whatever the added running cost is - it is so small that I consider it negligible. Also fan noise isn't bad at all. When I'm alone, setting 1 provides a good amount of white noise in the background. Music, videos, or any other sound I make isn't overwhelmed by this fan running less than 3 feet away from me. When I have company, a normal conversation is enough to drown out the noise this fan makes even on setting 3.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm really enjoying this fan and it's helped keep me cool on these hot summer days.
 Works great. One thing could be improved needs to be more stable at base, fear of knocking over, cools great.
 Very nice fan, keeps air moving well.
 Wish it was a little bit more powerful.  It seems like high should be more of a low.  I live in arizona though, where it is 110 degrees.
 Excellent coverage for an expensive item. Appreciate that it was offered. Very reasonable.
 Works well. Very quiet even on higher settings.
 Quiet and it does a good job of circulating the air. Bought two fans so obviously I would recommend these.
 Great deal, and works really well. Have had it for about 8 months now, and no issues.
 The features are good. However, the fan works intermittently. Right now I have to tap on the top of it so the fan will start and then it runs for a short time and shuts itself off.
 Exactly what I was looking for to keep the house cool
 I bought this as a gift for my mother as she does not like to run the air conditioner.  She loves it and it keeps her duplex cool.
 It broke in 2 days
 This is a great fan. Easy to put together and fairly quiet on the highest setting.
 Quiet and powerful enough to keep the air moving in the hottest room in our house.  Helps keep the AC off.
 Omits a great breeze and love the ionizer. The timer works great and the fan is not too loud. Good purchase for the summer!
 If you're a light sleeper like me, this is probably not the fan for you.  It doesn't not make an even, monotonous white noise.  Not that it makes a particularly annoying noise; it's just not totally even, which drives me batty as I try to sleep.  But, i am a light sleeper.  We bought a Honeywell tower fan at the same time, and it purrs like a fan should - perfectly consistent and never changing.  Now I realize that it doesn't matter so much how much noise a fan makes but rather how even a sound it produces.  Buy the Honeywell - it's cheaper,too.
 Quiet, versatile, trendy
 It's super quiet but also not as powerful as I was expecting.
 Great fan.has several features that is worth the extra few dollars. Much better than other fans used to date. Have purchased two to date. Recommend highly
 Fan worked great at cooling down room before it broke down.  The fan broke after 5 weeks of light use. I have contacted customer service a couple of weeks ago and have not heard back anything at all! Very disappointing experience overall.
 Easy to use
 An inexpensive tower fan from Lasko! It actually cools the air down and ionizes it, creating a constant airflow throughout your apartment/condo. I do not smell any metallic notes up in the air, like others have mentioned. Stylish and pretty quiet, although it can make some clicking sound, while in oscillation mode (it's made of plastic, what do you expect?) Remote controller comes in very handy! I love it!
 It is a great fan, but 5 years in it just died on me for no reason as it sat in my room. Ive been using it several times a week through the summer and partly even through the winter, but I just tried to start it up again and it wont turn on. The fan has great air movement and I love the controller. It tended to squeak while rotating from time to time, but lubricating the base helped keep that minimal. Really wish it wasn't a sign of modern manufacturing not lasting. Its not a super cheap fan. I feel like it shouldnt die after 5 years.
 This product damages easily in shipping due to cheap plastic. When I first turned it on I heard a grinding sound and slender pieces of black plastic fell out. I had to pay to return and only received credit for 25% of my shipping costs.  Do not buy via shipping.
 Love this fan and it's a space saver as well
 Quiet motor and great air movement.
 Love it great fan !
 Works great. got it the next day.I would like tohave one more for the other bedroom.I would buy again, nice remote.
 Great fan. I really like it. It is similar to having an A.C. Quiet too.
 Great!
 Good product.  Works as expected.
 This is the first time I decided to go for a non conventional fan like Tower Fan. I am using the same for over a month,I am highly impressed by it's performance. it's silent working is the greatest pleasure and helping us to dare the summer days.
 Awesome and quiet, we were able to lower our living room temp 2 degrees and can't tell the difference.
 Works great
 Keeps the room very cool and fresh!
 I love my fan!
 EXCELLENT PRODUCT
 This fan just quite working after 2 months of normal use.
 Only wish you would rotate more
 I have had this fan less than a year and it already has issues....I can't leave the fan on over an hour without it smoking and causing my room to smell like smoke. Maybe I just got a defective one.
 Does what I got it to do. Ions? What a concept!
 I just moved to the beach where I need a fan to cool the living room on some warm days. This fan does the job, it's quiet and the size is a good fit for my room.
 Works well
 Great product.
 So far so good
 Was rated as one best that's why I purchased but it's awful worst investment I've purchased this year.
 the fan needs a better base. Seems wobbly
 Awesome product!!
 I had to send it back with a broken fan.
 Great fan. I replaced an older version that I had for years. This one works better than the original. It's perfect for the space we have it in.
 This is a great fan. It was easy to assemble. It's a good value as well. I like the fact that it is not loud on the high speed.
 Working perfectly for my needs!  Love it!
 This one works great...but remote is not that user friendly and rotation is not full 180..which bothers me some time.
 Doesn't balance well on thick carpets, but otherwise it works as intended.
 Muy buen abanico
 Good heater; good price.
 I bought this in August and now (3 monta latter) it’s no working
 Stopped working after 3 years. I'm okay with that.
 Fast shipping... Great price.
 Very happy with this purchase. Using it and small room.
 Great product and cooled very good.
 Great circulation but very loud
 As good as described
 It is wonderful
 It works well for a fan; however, when I received mines a couple buttons had been mashed in. Thankfully it comes with a remote otherwise I wouldn't have been able to turn it on.
 It doesn't blow as hard as my last lasko, but still good!
 I purchased this to help keep my Florida air conditioning bill down. So far it is helping. I have the air set at 82 and it feels comfortable with this fan going in the room. I also have ordered the Vornado 660. I'll see which is better for sleeping.
 Very pleased with this fan.  Did a lot of research before deciding on this one.  Not as attractive as some others but I really like the sturdy base rather than the pedestal design.  I would recommend this fan.
 Great product
 Great features and very quiet, highly recommend
 I never used to like using a fan but this one is so awesome that I bought two!
 Really pumps the air!  Quiet and easy to assemble.
 This is the third fan I purchased in search of a truly quiet fan for my bedroom. I guess the third time's the charm. This fan is wonderful! It is very quiet, even on the highest setting, yet puts out plenty of air even at the lowest speed. It makes a real difference, even in  large room with a cathedral ceiling, so I can rely much less on the air conditioning. I am truly pleased with this item and highly recommend it.
 Did not even work when plugged in the first time.  Do not purchase!
 I needed an oscillating fan with a remote control and enough force to cool me off on a hot day. Mission accomplished! Once I put it together it worked well.  It is being used almost every day in front of the treadmill since July 2012.
 It runs well and is not noisy. Stand seems to be pretty stable on carpet floors. One higher setting would be nice.
 We got this fan last summer and were very impressed. It does its job well, doesn't take up much space and is super quiet - you won't even notice its running. We bought another one for the guest bedroom and my dad/mom wanted to buy one to take with them back to India. Overall, a nice product and highly recommended for anyone looking for a good looking, quiet fan for a reasonable price.
 It's not summer yet, so I've only experimented.  I appreciated all the reviews that made this selection easy.  The thing I'm most happy to concur with is the very quiet operation of this unit. Icons on buttons make sense; remote has both icons and labels..  4 stars?  Be prepared: It's pretty big at nearly 43".  Only 8" diameter, stand just over 12".  It's no bigger than they said it was...  and this height does allow for many vertical levels of coverage.  But it's not unobtrusive in the room.  Who cares when it's 90 degrees though, right?  and it is nice-looking quality.
 Very nice
 I have two at my home and I bought these three for my daughter so more cool air would blow around here home in Phoenix.
 Exactly what I was looking for.
 Great! medium sound.
 Got this for my brother and I was real surprised for what you pay is an excellent buy.
 I have had several tower fans in the past 5 years.  I like that they are quiet and blow a long column of air.  I hate that they are impossible to clean.  I stripped down the last one I had just to see if I could clean it.  After 45 minutes, a few pieces of broken plastic, and about 50 screws, I was able to clean the paddle wheel inside the fan with a vacuum, brush and canned air.  On completion, I noticed that there were still significant amounts of dust on the damn thing.  So then I looked at the alternatives.  Namely the Dyson fan that is just a loop like a race track.  That would be easy to clean but it costs 6 times what this fan does.  If I can use each fan for about 18 months before a real cleaning is needed, it would be 9 years before the purchase of a Dyson fan makes sense.  So I made the decision to go with these fans.  I will recycle them at the Community Resource Center when they get too dirty for me and move on.  No more researching how to clean these fans easily.  No more researching how to get a Dyson fan for less.  Just buy the damn fan.
 Box was a bit damaged but the product was fine.
 I read a few reviews complaining that this item was too loud.  When I first turned the fan on I was worried that it wasn't pushing out enough air because it WAS TOO QUIET.  Not the case, it is quieter on its high setting than my box fan is on its low setting.  The fan doesn't take up very much room.  I think the ionizer function is a little hokey, but I didn't buy it for that feature.
 i love it. keeps my living room cool.
 Works beautifully! Very happy with it.
 Great product
 Best fan ever,
 This is the best fan we're ever had. Because it's tall &amp; slim, it fits in a corner of any room. It's amazing how this concept cools a room. Great price also. Free shipping was a plus!
 Good fan
 Not that quiet as they promised
 So this review is very mixed. I absolutely love the product, 5+ stars. My parents have had this air conditioner for at least 6 years and it still works great. I just bought a house and purchased two for my new home. Unfortunately one of the products was shipped to me damaged and I did not realize until after I put it together. I should have realized sooner because the box was damaged on both. It still works fine but I wish I didn't pay $70 for damaged goods.
 works well
 Best fan I have ever had.
 Easy assembly, not too loud on high, nice to have a remote control.  We have it in a large bedroom so we must place it within about six feet of us to feel anything.
 Excellent fan. Bought one last year for my mothers home, and just bought one for me this year. Looks great, quiet and is perfect for a med-small room/office.
 I am very satisfied. It saves space and works as I expected.
 I've had this fan for about 2 months, and it has beeen amazing!  My only issue is that it will 'click' occasionally when it's rotating.it's helped make the entire room smell better.
 Works great and color is perfect .... Very pleased
 The height is just right, I love the fact that it has a remote
 Ordered this fan after seeing reviews of many other models. This came with nice packaging, the installation is very easy and doesn't require any other tools. Sound from this fan is almost negligible even at 3. Nice cool air comes from the fan and the room gets cool very quickly with the fan oscillation. Nice for summers
 Arrived without any screws in the box.  Had to go to hardware store and try several screws to figure out what would fit.  Very inconvenient.
 We own one of these tower fans from several years ago.  This is an improved model and would highly recommend it.  Quiet operation.
 I love this fan!  I have 2 of these fans and just ordered 2 more.  I have ceiling fans in most of my rooms, but this fan does a great job of circulating the air without a whole lot of breeze or noise.  Having said that, it makes just enough white noise to nighttime soothe our youngest babe (two and a half) and his dad (40).
 It works great,  very quiet and sturdy.  It doesn't wobble when it rotates.
 I'm very happy with it. My parents now added it to their home as well. Very quite, air flow feels very good, turns wide enough.
 Love it. Keeps my daughters huge bedroom cool. Also, very quiet, oscillating action is quiet too. Also very sturdy.
 Pipes out some really good wind and I love the ionizer. Also haven't had many issues with pet hair with this fan so far. Having two dogs that can sometimes be a problem. So far, very satisfied with what I got and for how much I paid for it.
 Love the way it cools my kitchen
 Love it!!!
 DOES THE JOB
 Awesome for the price thanks
 This product looks fine, but it is noisy! And I am not talking about the actual motor or fan movement. If I move it at all, I can hear it spinning and rubbing against something on the inside. Something definitely seems to be wrong, and this excessive noise that shouldn't be present concerns me. I really question the longevity of this product and wish it were better manufactured. The plastic is creaky.<br/><br/>After using it all Summer and letting it sit for a few weeks without being turned on, this fan practically needed life support to get going again. It eventually warmed up and began to move air, but if it doesn't work come Spring of 2018, I'll consider it defective.
 I really liked
 That annoying beep!!! My goodness.... Whoever thought this was a good idea should be fired!! I had no idea I would be so bothered by the beep. Not to mention one of the three fans I purchased stopped working after it started making A loud screeching noise... Won't buy this brand again!
 product stopped working on a few months after we purchased it. not happy.
 Good blast of air, we've been using it for little more than a month consistently now. I like the timer aspect in it.<br/>On the other side, I haven't quite been able to figure out what difference the ION mode does.
 After reading the good reviews on Amazon, I ordered this fan and received it quickly.  Put it together (a bit of a job for my limited capacities, but got it done).  Figured the remote was rather superfluous, but am really enjoying this convenience when I'm in bed and want to turn it on or off.  The remote works just fine if you point it right -- no problem.  So glad I have it to use when it's too warm at night to open up the house to usually cool desert nights.
 Works great, nice and quiet but the build quality is missing, very cheap plastic feel, still recommend it though.
 This fan is just what I was looking for. Looks good and produces a lot of air flow. Also noise level is very low. Highly recommend.
 The fan was broke and in pieces it's  the worst item I have ever bought
 does the job very well.. looks good. stable. quiet.
 Wonderful fan! We moved to hawaii and with the humidity ... we use it all day!<br/>Very quiet ..<br/>Glad we bought it!
 Product arrived ok but the unit can only be controlled using the remote.  None of the buttons on top of the unit were functional.
 Love this fan.  Looks and works great!
 Nice Product
 I love this fan and so do my guests! It is much quieter than other fans, the blue light some mentioned can easily be covered with a sock, etc., love the timer, I'd buy again.
 My room is small so I don't need a strong fan, this one fits my need. The only think i don't like is the fan's remote control. It is hard to press.
 I bought this fan in June this year, and yesterday it no longer oscillates, no matter how many times I pushed it.  Very disappointed with this product.
 At first when I ordered, I was afraid if it would be good or not, but once I got it, its almost a month now, its the best fan I have owned ever. cools the room in minutes, has an ionizer and timers to auto-stop. Highly recommend to others. The best part, not too heavy, just take to any room, plug in and enjoy.
 Best fan ever. Great purchase. Not loud at all like others say. All hardware included. Looks great in person. Thinking of replacing all my fans with these!!
 Stopped working just after the one month return window. Trying to get a refund or replacement.
 The fan provides a good breeze and is relatively quiet.  I have had it only a short time so we will see how it holds up over time.
 It makes too much noise even at low speed
 works great.
 The fan is fine, but after a few uses it begins to have a burnt plastic smell. I read up online a bit about it and this is a common issue with the fan. I plan to replace the fan next summer.
 Bought for my Mom who is in a nursing home.  The remote control was perfect for her.  She is not mobile but can control her room temperature from her chair.  It is quiet and does not take up a great deal of space.
 Quiet, works well, easy to put together. 100% recommend
 Purchased July 5th, 2017 and this fan has already stopped working. So disappointed.
 fantastic product, works like a charm
 Very nice air flow and quiet when in use. The base was a little cumbersome to put together.  The remote control feature is nice.
 Perfect for the bedroom. Not too noisy, easy to use. Recommended
 Quiet.  A great fan.
 Power wasn't what I expected. It blows air just like any other $20 fan.
 I like this fan.  I like that it has an built in ionizer.  It has a nice sweep when circulating.  It was a little bigger than I expected but it is still not obtrusive in a room.  Definitely recommend.
 Good low noise fan but Bright led and loud buttons not so good.
 A bit noisy
 THE BEST FAN I HAVE EVER OWNED! Puts out so much cold air and keeps me cool all night long.
 The fan is VERY weak
 Works wonderful;, going to buy another one!
 I have had the fan for one month.  I woke up this morning and tried to turn it it on. No results. Let's just say I'm not a"fan".
 Works fine out of the box but a little noisier than other tower fans that we own.  Swivel range is also limited, well less than 90 degree turn.
 xlnt price &amp; fast ship !!!
 Buy this fan.<br/><br/>If you want a stand up fan, you should buy this one. It isn't cheap, but it does a great job. We bought two of these, and couldn't be happier with them.
 Annoyingly noisy. Makes this rumbling machine like sound, which defeats the whole purpose of choosing this particular fan in the first place. 😕
 Nice and silent
 Fan is a bit bulky, but generates a real nice even air flow, and remains quiet.  Full feature set with rotation, and remote.  Well built product.
 I ordered 2 Lasko Fans &amp; they were just what I was looking for! Sleek &amp; quiet.<br/>This beauty I ordered for my living room &amp; it was easy to put together, but the 3 screws that are needed to stable the stand were not in the box.<br/>I wanted to contact the seller, but did not find them here were I ordered from. Love the fan! Just can't move it without unplugging.<br/>Other than that LOPVE IT!
 THIS IS GREAT AND NO SOUNDS
 The fan is louder than I expected.  Still a good buy.
 My product arrived with the screws missing, but good ole' Amazon picked it up the next day and promptly gave me a credit.  One of the few glitches in my Amazon purchasing adventures. The fan itself is an excellent product.
 We've had it for six months. Was doing an okay job cooling our bedroom, not great, but it's not an AC unit. Kept the air circulating, at least. It died the other day. Just... kaput. Will not turn on, and no obvious way to repair it.
 Love my fan. Saves on bills by not running ac on blast.
 Love this fan!!
 Great product and easy to use and assemble...
 I like it a lot.
 I like the remote feature. A little noisier than expected but it helps with creating the much needed white noise that I need in the evening.
 Straight up broke after less than a day of work. The light turns on and it oscillates but nothing else happens. Pretty disappointed that I'm now left with such a huge piece of junk
 Quiet and has the right air speed.
 This fan is sturdy and quite. The ionization keeps the air fresh. This fan is a bid taller than others, so it does a great job of circulating the air. Remote control has full function of the fan, easy to operate. So far this has been a great purchase.
 awesome fan! would buy again!
 fan works well and timer feature is excellent.  quiet as promised.
 keeps air cool!
 After about a month of ownership, here are my conclusions: This is the biggest tower fan I've ever seen outside of an industrial setting.  I live in Phoenix, so I own several fans, but this one is about 2:1 bigger than any other I own.  Sadly, it's not the best fan I own (the current champ is a Honeywell).  This fan doesn't push as much air as I would expect it to for its size, and the settings (low-med-high) aren't much different from each other.  It is, however, relatively quiet; when it doesn't click.  It has a little adjustable vent air deflector like the vents in your car... When mine arrived, two of the fins in the vent were knocked out of the sockets and I had to use needle-nose pliers to get it in place.  This fan smelled terrible like burning plastic when I first unboxed it - I recommend planning to leave it outside overnight after opening.
 I first loved it. It was silent for the first 2 weeks and instead of using the AC, I could use it in our bedroom. But then it started slowly to make noise. The base in not very sturdy and leveled so the fan must touch something...or maybe a piece is slack inside. The sound comes and go. Maybe I got a bad one. That is very disapointing. I have to play with it to stop the buzzing sound. I would use in another place. I am disapointed because I first loved it.
 Love it!!
 Great product
 Covers area room well.  Good buy.
 Quiet and works very well for my bedroom when I am not using my air conditioner.
 Great size for my sons dorm room, quiet and works great.
 Good cooling
 I love it.
 So far good. no complain.
 PERFECT!
 I live in a two story house and when it's hot outside, the upstairs (where the bedrooms are) becomes hot as well. The A/C cools the downstairs just fine, but struggles with cooling the upstairs on a hot afternoon. The fan I was using was becoming increasingly noisy, to the point where I could tell it was getting ready to quit on me soon. So I ordered this fan based on the high reviews. The fan is super quiet and esthetically pleasing. However, it was not powerful enough for me. It produces a nice cool breeze on high. However, I have a huge bedroom and need something that can cool me (and the room) without the fan having to sit right in front of me. I'm going keep it and probably use it elsewhere because, overall, it is a nice fan. I just ordered one of those high velocity tower fans, so hopefully that does the trick!
 Not very strong
 I used my rewards points gt this for 24 bucks really nice quiet at low speed perfect for my room
 Came with broken fins.  Frustrating to receive a "new" product and have it arrive broken :(
 Very quiet. Helps to move the air around. Love the look of it.
 Very efficient
 I wish there were just one more setting below the 1 setting that is a little more quieter, otherwise great fan!
 I was very disappointed with this fan, sent it back. The velocity of the fan was that of a desk fan, not what I anticipated. Also, I had to put together the base.
 Very good product.
 With heat wave we are having I would be in trouble without my wonderful fan.  It's great.
 This product suddenly stopped functioning after 3 months of use.
 First saw this fan at my daughter's in South Florida.  Thought it was great but didn't get it at the time.  When the first 90 degree plus heat wave hit I ordered it and I am so glad I did.  It does everything plus looks great in my newly updated great room.. It is stylish, modern and quiet. And it takes up so little room. I would not hesitate suggesting it to all.
 Overall this is a good fan, but I thought that it would be a bit more powerful.
 Not satisfied with air flow it provides. We need to keep it very close even when we run it at maximum speed.
 Works great
 Need another for master bedroom. Keeps air cool. lightweight and easy to assemble.
 Finally i made a right choice! Fan with cool features.<br/>1. Has remote to control it<br/>2. Can swing<br/>3. Has timer to turn off automatically<br/><br/>Easy to assemble &amp; easy to move!<br/>I really liked this product.
 Love this fan! Love the remote
 Spend the money on this fan-you will never regret it. As a second floor apartment dweller, this fan has made hot summer days so much more bearable. Easy to assemble, is very quiet for a fan, timer function is wonderful. I wish I had purchased this fan years ago!
 Best, quiet fan on the market!!
 Perfect for the job.
 Good design but a little weak
 Bought this Lasko fan after reading many reviews about it. It really keeps you cool just on level 1. Even though it's been very hot at times, I've not had to use the ion feature. Really good buy.
 Got here just in time for 3 hottest days of the year. Nites at 80 degrees.  Wonderful to  sleep  being  faned softly from  head to foot. .Getting it put together was a bit tricky  by myself. But it was easy to follow the instructions.  Glad I have the  tall and handsome fan
 Love it moves back-and-forth and quiet great product
 I bought this because it looks elegant in the picture. The wooden finish was the biggest selling point. This is my first tower fan and I was eagerly looking forward to getting it. The item that I got yesterday turned out to be highly disappointing. First of all, the material is clearly cheap and flimsy. It even had a small crack in the back - something that would have resulted in a return if I didn't have to go through the hassle of mailing it back. It feels very unstable while moving it or even while pressing the buttons.<br/><br/>Worst came after I switched it on. It started with a small rattling noise from somewhere inside towards the top. The noise disappeared when I pressed tight at a spot near the top, but returned when I released the hold. It got very annoying, so I held it facing down and gave it a spank :) and that quietened it. It must be really bad quality in there. It remained quiet for the whole of last night, but I know for sure, rattles like that in cheap products like this will eventually come back. For now, I am keeping it, but if the rattling noise comes back, it is going back.
 super quiet, tall and sleek.  Great air flow.  Highly recommended
 Works great!!!
 Great fan!  Was listed as used- no issues!
 I shopped around and decided this was the best buy. So far I have been pleased. I bought it for the upper level bedrooms. Put it in hallway and it helps cool off both rooms :)
 Grear in every way.
 Fair fan. High speed does not blow hard enough.
 This fan is great.  Seems to always blow out cold air and is very quiet.  I am very pleased with the purchase.
 This item gave up after 6 weeks occasional use. Amazon were very good and gave me a full refund but Lasko never returned my message.I will not buy another Lasko product.
 This fan works like a charm! I love it! I am very glad I bought it! It's 100% worth it!
 Good product however screws missing from package.
 I am so happy with this fan that I immediately purchased a second one after using it for the first time.  Very high quality and quiet!
 Great fan and I've enjoyed it!
 I have had this fan for about a month now and absolutely love it.
 I bought this fan when my A/C went on the fritz.  It is quiet, dependable and took 10 minutes (tops) to assemble (and I am a total klutz when it comes to assembling anything).
 It is sturdy, puts out a lot of wind without noise and looks like a piece of furniture. My daughter bought this fan a few years ago and told me<br/>how pleased they were with fan. I hope you continue making this fan, so I can buy another one in the future. Thanks
 Stylish and effective. Looks good, works great, reasonable price.
 I love this little/big fan. I use it as an external air cooling device for my monster gaming computer and it works wonders. My computer used to stew in its own heat and subsequently overheat and shut down. Sure it had liquid cooling and ample heat mitigation measures, but all that heat just blew out of the box and stayed in the general area, making the boxes intake take in hot air. Well this fan did away with that, and now my computer works wonderful.
 Love it. Does a good job.
 I received the item on time, however as soon as I received it the weather got cold so i haven't had a chance to use it. It looks great though.
 Looks nice but wind production is terrible. Past a foot away you can't feel a thing. Dont buy
 Good fan..super fancy and elegant...a lil bit noisy but isnt bad...I mean is a fan has to do a noise.... for the price is a good deal..
 Softly, quietly moves an appropriate amount of air.
 Great product !
 Have been using for a week now. I didn't like the material initially but the fan does work well. So far we are happy with the product...
 Perfect!
 Fan worked properly from box, but after being plugged in for 4 hours, it turned on itself and would not turn off with mounted switch or remote. Lasko rep stated it must be a defective control panel, please send back.
 The best looking fan I've ever had. I'm getting compliments from friends visiting.  Runs very quiet, cools room quickly. I'm thinking about buying another one.
 WOW ...such force and a remote...what more can I ask for ...thrilled to have year round in my bedroom ..
 Stopped working 1 month after we got it and past the time we can return.
 Fan works great but the screws did not come with. I'm assuming because it looked as it has been bought and then returned. A little disappointed with Amazon, but other than that it is a great buy!
 I will agree this is actually a pretty loud fan. The fan/air moving isnt the loud part. It's the humming from the fan motor itself. I can be in another room and hear the low humming. I compare it to a transformer you hear on a utility pole. It's just a low droning noise. Im hoping that it wears in and quiets down. The highest setting isn't the strongest i've ever felt, but it's plenty of enough for what I'm using it for and that is to move air while I sleep. I don't regret buying this, but I'm not shouting from the roof top that I did.
 It’s recommended
 The fan is working fine but there is a toxic smell like something is burning.
 Big enough and not noisy. Good control.
 This fan arrived missing the screws necessary to secure the fan to the base. The fan itself works great but I would still like to receive the screws.
 Good fan. Nice and quiet
 That fan looks amazing in the living room. I wish that I bought it sooner!
 The fan is pretty much ready out of the box. There's going to be noise with any fan you buy, but luckily this fan keeps it very low.The multiple speed and time settings along with the remote really made this fan a solid purchase for me.
 Reallly like this tower!...very quiet, just wish it had a  higher fan setting than "3"...but all in all....it's a great tower
 Does the job! Not much power though
 I live in a small apartment in NYC and cannot install a ceiling fan. This tower fan was the perfect solution for me to improve air circulation in my apartment. It does not take up a lot of space and it really cools the entire area. Since I am a light sleeper, I also love that it makes so little noise.
 The remote is a little finicky, otherwise good fan and works as expected
 Enough cool air for a standard room.. Not Heavy not noisy, no visible fins, purifies air.. They kept it simple
 Was not pleased with fan. Feels like a regular fan. Very disappointed
 I like that it was easy to assemble and that it's quite
 awesome fan i love it
 If you don't have AC this is amazing.  High quality.
 Have only used it for a week or so. Works as expected. Adequate power for a small-midsize room. Quiet operation.
 Great fan and really spreads the aire
 Fantastic Cooler. Value for money. Does not make a lot of noise.
 Love this fan.  The remote could have a little greater range, but it's not bad (10-12 ft. seems to be my max).  Quiet at low speeds, not bad at the highest setting.  The fresh air Ionizer works great.  Would buy this one again.
 Quiet functions and plenty of air for our family room.
 Working amazing right now hopefully it stays this good for as lo g as I have it
 Nice, quite unit. Wish the air flow was a bit stronger.  Overall, a good value.
 Quiet yet powerful tons of options and the remote is the best. Also you can set a timer for the fan to turn itself off. Ion feature is great too. Overall its a great buy. Im going to buy another one for my living room.
 A bit noisy but overall great product.
 It serves it purpose in my hot office. Good product
 Great air flow. Works well in a large room. Easy to use.
 Fan showed up with a broken button. I put full batteries in remote, also does not work. Fan would he great if it wasn't always stuck on high.
 Read previous reviews and this fan is excellent
 I love this product and basically it works very well. It's powerful and it has a remoter, which means I can place almost anywhere in my room. But looks like I don't have screws in the package, and the amazon customer service gave me 10 bucks as refund to let me buy them in a local store
 Great fan at a great price. The controls are quite convenient, and the ionizer feature really makes the air seem quite fresh.
 GREAT PERFORMANCE AND LOOKS GOOD TOO.  DOESN'T TAKE UP THE ROOM A REGULAR FAN DOES.
 great fan
 Great
 Great purchase, the fan was a lot larger than I thought. It looks and works beautifully. The remote is cool!
 Love it and still enjoying it thanks
 Love this fan.  My ac will be replaced in a few weeks and so fan was purchased to keep bedroom cooler til ac is replaced.  Arrived today.  It was easy to assemble and attach the 2 piece base.  And wow! Great cooling.  I'll sleep well tonight.  This is a substantial fan, we'll made.  I've tried several modes and look the remo.  When ac is in I'll have this to use when I'm doing projects in the garage ... very nice.  I priced this fan at one walk in store locally and another online source ... both were $20 more.  True bargain here.
 Performs beautifully with minimul noise. It also fits well in the limited space I have available.
 Did provide us with comfort. Good price. Very light and doesn't attract debris. met our expectations. Runs with quite and ease.
 Good value for the money.
 Absolutely love this product!
 The fan is very powerful and has been an excellent addition to our formal living room. The plastic base is a little shaky but the remote control comes in real handy.
 Pros: looks nice, fairly quiet. Has a louver up/down adjustment.<br/>Cons: Wobbly and bulky. The louver adjustment is limited, it moves the fins very slightly, so the air flow stays rather low to the ground even in the upwardest position.<br/><br/>I bought 2 fans recently, one was this Lasko, the other one was this Soleus: <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Soleus-FC3-35R-12-Gliding-Grille-Tower-Fan/dp/B003S8KLPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Soleus FC3-35R-12 Gliding Grille Tower Fan</a><br/><br/>I like the Soleus better because even though it's much shorter/compact (and thus more stable), it shoots air higher due to its tilt, so you feel it much better while you're standing. I'm using both fans, but the Soleus is my favorite.
 Fast delivery. Thank you
 This is a great fan. Worth every penny, looks great and works even better. I even bought another one for a family member.
 The fan is a good size and cools pretty well. The only thing is that the fan is on the noisy side. It's advertised to be quiet, but it's definitely not. It's actually quite annoying while I'm sleeping so I now use it in my living room where it's fine. Would not recommend for my friends or family. There are just too many other options to choose something so sub-par. It makes a weird clicking noise occasionally as well.
 Great product. A little noisy but it's powerful and tall. Worth the money.
 Had purchased this Lasko fan a few years ago and just purchased a second one for the living room.  Does the job and is nice and quiet.  The only downside is that it's not the strongest fan even on the 3rd setting, but that's what you trade for minimal noise.  I would recommend.
 This is a great fan.  It's quiet and really cools the area.
 ...simply excellent fan! Quiet, effective and well designed.
 Nice fan. It's effective and quiet.
 So far it is working well.  I can't tell if the ionizer makes a difference.<br/>Sound is at a good level.
 Good fan for what it's made to do. Works very well for one room.
 Great product. Does exactly as described.
 The best forget the rest
 Package came without the screws to assemble the base. The little baggie that I am assuming was supposed to contain the screws was empty.  Cannot use as is. Total bummer.
 Would give it five stars except the remote only works if I hold it about six inches from the fan, I changed out several sets of batteries and it still did not work any better.<br/>Called the company, the customer service was great and immediately sent me a new remote which took care of my problem. I would strongly recommend this fan and this company. Give it a five star rating now.
 I did some comparisons when asked to purchase a fan for my boss. I found that for the price and performance this was the best value. I'm very pleased with it as is my boss. A month later I had another request for a fan and I purchased another with no hesitation. It is quiet, space saving, and with it's good style and looks  it fits well in an office or in a home.
 Works great gets cold  fast.
 We love this fan. We have had them for a couple of years now. We liked the first one so much that we bought 2 more. Quiet and efficient.
 I love this fan it keeps my house cool even if I turn off my AC.
 Noisy
 Useless. You have to be exactly in front of the fan to get some breeze. Overpriced, wasting some space in my house.
 Great machine so far. I was concerned it was weak based on the lack of noise but it's actually quite powerful.
 Great unit and helps to circulate the air in my room.
 Make the room so cold that you don't need a blanket, and depending on your noise level tolerance, it can be annoying if you expect it to be whisper quiet.
 Make the room so cold that you don't need a blanket, and depending on your noise level tolerance, it can be annoying if you expect it to be whisper quiet.
 this is my second fan.  I can not sleep without it.
 Love this
 Quite efficient and effective. Love it
 this is a great looking fan.. it has everything you need with settings and looks fantastic.. well worth the cost.
 Works well, relatively quiet, easy to use.
 good
 Great output and super quite
 It's awfully loud, and the ionization light is too damn bright to use at night.
 Best fan I have ever owned.  It's pretty strong, so it is cooler than a regular stand fan. It can be a little noisy at first, but it isn't annoying, and you get used to the pretty fast. Remote is a great plus, and it looks great too.
 Received as expected but after working for one night I shut it off my way to work and when I got home that night it wouldn't turn on anymore. Tried different outlets and verified power and nothing. Ordered a replacement and it arrived quickly. I understand you can get a defective item but the negative review is more for the inconvenience of setting up a return, printing the label, and getting it to a drop off point. This is the downside of ordering online but 99% of the time everything works out great.
 Not as powerful as expected.
 This fan is noisy! Constantly has a clicking noise.
 Love it! The ionization option is wonderful!
 So, I purchased this fan to replace a different Lasko fan that I had and that fan was loud and big in size. I needed something that would save space so I decided to get this fan. This fan blows great and its quiet. I can feel the air blowing even when I sit far away from it.
 Like this fan a lot!  It's quiet and just right for our small apartment.
 Quiet, and good air production
 Easy to put together. Powerful fan.  Quiet when running. Covers large area of the room.  Fair price.
 Works great and is very quiet!<br/>Great fan for the price.
 it's 90 degrees and humid,<br/>but the window units too loud for my sweet cupid.<br/>i went online to find a fan,<br/>because i had some money, because i can.<br/>These weren't too pricey and the quality's not dicey.<br/>it cools us down even when we're hot and spicy.<br/>we use the remote control when we're hot and lazy,<br/>but we have to get up when our memory is hazy,<br/>because lost remotes can drive people crazy!<br/>so order your fan and watch some swayze or scorsese,<br/>you'll be able to hear it with this quiet fan on, wait and see!
 Perfect for my loft that gets so warm in the summer
 Very good fan and not that expensive!!
 perfect fan for the bedroom!
 Came with no screws to put it together. If I can find some screws to put it together, I'll keep it, if not, I'm returning it
 Very good fan, would highly recommend!
 This fan is impressive. It some how manages to blow out extremely cold air. I've tried various forms of fans and portable AC units fueled by water and this fan is by far the closest thing to a brand new AC window unit. It's lowest level is almost too cold in most scenarios. The air flow is strong and can fill a 250sqft room with ease.
 It's light and quite.
 I bought this fan as a gift for my parents. They absolutely love it and run it almost constantly at home, even though they don't really need it. It is very quiet, but produces a good breeze.
 Like the looks as well as the fact I that you can regulate the speed.  The oscillating feature is very helpful in cooling the room.
 Very Good Product for Seattle are
 I love it :-*
 Works great but like others said it did not come with screws to attach the base
 I am so glad to have selected this Lasko fan. The remote is wonderful. The fan is fairly quiet so you don't need to raise your voice while it is operating. I will buy another one
 Upgrade over our old boxfan
 Very tall and pretty quite. I was disappointed in the air flow. Made for a small room. I have owned Lasko products<br/> like this design without ion, but  the air flow was greater
 fan works great just does not cool the air as ads suggest.......it a quiet fan and thats all a fan!!!!!!
 Looks good but does not give too much air.
 It worked great with all this hot weather we're  having. It help save on my electric  bill.
 Doesn't occupy a lot of space in the room. The oscillating feature, 3 step speed controls, and timer options make it totally worth the money!
 Great fan. Low noise. Bought two.
 Not as quiet as i thought it may be, but works great and my Labrador loves to lay in front of it.
 I have had 4 so far and will always have the wave
 fan speed is not that strong..
 weak even on the highest setting. would not recommend.
 After putting it all together and plugging it in I notice that the timer button is mashed in and can't be pulled out. The other settings/buttons work fine and I wouldn't even care about the timer feature for a fan but it's there and I can use it.<br/><br/>It taunts me.... Shaking back and forth like "Nope, you'll never get the full use of this product." I'll prolly end up breaking the whole fan somehow just trying to pop the button back out knowing my luck so it gets an extra star off for this missing feature.
 Looks nice and has decent output.  But it rattles, I can't use it at night because it keeps me up with the noise.
 Fan has nice features but oscillating is limited to less than 90 degrees.  Remote is a nice add on to have.
 not as cold as i thought it would be.
 It was not as good as I expected it to be , a bit noisy the 2510 was the one I originally wanted but u did not have it it's also a bit noisy but I think the air is much cooler
 Wonderful, quiet fan! The rotating feature is a bit loud. Timer setting, various speeds, this fan is terrific! Remote control is a definite plus.  This fan beats the heat, so you can sleep.
 The fan I received had weak airflow and loud hum.
 My only small complaint when using it indoors is the very bright blue light.  When used for sleeping, i just needed to tape over it...otherwise, very good value.
 Works very well, but a little loud on high.  It has been just what we needed for our unusually warm weather.  May get another.
 Really quietly
 Great fan and low noise
 Unit damaged in shipping, easy to rectify to stop noisy fan.
 Broken
 Little sound but that is not impacting our sleep
 I feel the fan could be better for the price paid such as the size or the features. As a light to moderate sleeper, the fan noise is not too loud and I can manage to sleep through it<br/>Note: I have only had this machine for 2 months<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-machine stays cool even after a 16 hr use<br/>-air blown out is slightly cooler than the room temperature<br/>-timer range is large, starts at 30 minutes<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-bulky/large fan<br/>-degree of oscillation is small<br/>-remote range is short and can be difficult to use at certain angles
 NIce high quality fan.  Easy to put together, good air flow and looks good in the room.
 Started rattling within a month. Horrible
 Not as quiet as I'd hoped for
 The Lasko Wind Curve fan arrived quickly from Amazon and came in the original box (so fortunately the shipping company didn't rough it up too much). It looks great, runs quiet, puts out a lot of air, and the remote is a great, convenient feature. It has a one year warranty and good customer service from what I've read so that's nice.
 Good!
 i like the Quiet , it works real well and enjoy the different speeds !!! it was worth the Money!
 Works, but makes an annoying rattling noise.
 Very high quality. Quiet and easy to operate.
 Had it for about 2 months and works really well. I have a small bedroom and it works just fine in it. It saved me during the hot weather in Cali
 I think the fan is very stylish for one. Not like an ugly box fan. I have used all of the speeds, which usually I have one setting I like. This is a nice fan that fits nicely in a corner and can blend with other furniture.
 Works well.  Very quiet.
 this is definitely the best "fan" I have ever purchased. It does everything the website states it will, plus the look<br/>is sleek,stylish and space saving.
 Frustrating that the fan died at 4 am in a puff of smoke, depriving me of sleep and just days outside the return window.
 As expected.
 Could be more powerful. Sleek looking and easy to assemble. Quiet enough to sleep to
 We bought this to use in the warmest room of the house and it has preformed great.
 Exceeded expectations... quiet, efficient, well-built, and attractive.
 Unfortunately nowhere near worth the price.
 Works great
 The fan is ok. I was hoping it would be a little more powerful. Runs quiet which is nice.
 Not the strongest fan but it works.
 Looks great and works well
 Works great
 fan worked for a little over a month and then quit.
 Great fan for an affordable price. Not as loud as the other fans we have. I would buy it again.
 Great fan buying another one
 Smells like a burning wire after using it for 3 months.
 Best fan for the price I've ever purchased. Its quiet which is a huge selling point for me. It also has a timer feature that I didnt notice when I first bout it. I plan to buy a couple more for other rooms of my house.
 It's nice but it doesn't blow cold air, it mainly circulates the air. The remote is really basic and low quality.
 Very nice in this hot summer
 My  old  fan broke. This is a great product and would highly recommend it.
 Nice fan.
 very will ！
 This is the first tower fan I have bought and we are pretty happy with it. At first we thought the maximum fan speed is low, but later realized that it is designed to give a breeze effect rather than blowing air at you. It is working great, have no problems.
 Work great for one small room
 Very dissapointed. Pretty loud gurgling sound towards the top of the fan like it wasn't put together very well.
 Like it, unlike others the light doesnt bother me and its powerful yet quiet, works well in my small room, my 12' x 12' box.
 Does a great job at keeping my bedroom nice and comfortable during these hot summer nights.
 I FEEL AS THOUGH THE BREATH OF GOD HAS BLESSED MY ROOM! AFTER SIMILAR PRAISE FROM A FRIEND ON THIS PRODUCT I SAID,' Why not, I have money.' AND LET ME TELL YOU, THIS THING KEEPS ME AS KOOL AS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PILLOW
 Pretty quiet, love the multiple settings and remote control, easy to assemble, shipped quickly, very true to its description.
 Very quiet, attractive and sturdy. Takes up little space and the air it moves is very good. Easy to assemble and opperate. The remote and timer are nice conveniences as well as the lighted control indicators.
 Great
 I bought this for my daughter’s bedroom because we needed some air circulation and to see if it would help at all with my daughter’s allergies. We love this fan! She uses the remote all the time, you can set it in half our increments if you want it to turn off. It’s not too loud and it cools the room perfectly. We haven’t had it long enough to comment on the ionizer. It was super easy to put together. It took about 10 minutes to get the whole thing set up including putting the batteries in the remote (you need two AAA). Also it’s very light weight and it looks nice. Very happy with the purchase.
 I purchased this fan for ambient noise and it's great! It has three different speed settings and the remote is a great added feature.  If you need a fan like I do to help fall asleep, then I highly suggest this fan.  Great buy!
 This fan does not just push around warm air like most. Put it anywhere in a room and it produces a strong current of cool air. Recommended highly it is worth the price.
 I love this product.
 The remote control does not work.
 I'm a fan of this fan
 Very effective.
 i love it..
 This fan barely blows air on high. I bought it because of the good ratings but it does very little. Other than being fairly quiet, I'm not impressed.
 Power button was broken right out of the box and had to return it right away.  Seems pretty cheaply put together.
 No problems. Works great.
 This fan is awesome.  It is large enough to cool a whole large room.  The low setting is like the high setting on my old fan.
 It works great. Easy to fix. The remote is a basic one though.(works only in line of sight).<br/>Minimal noise but you will get used to it.<br/><br/>70 degree oscillation only. My room is small so I keep it near my bed. Range is ok.<br/><br/>Couldn't notice any effect of the 'ion' but its good that it comes with it.
 Missing screws!! I wouldn't be complaining if I could find the right type, but the size on the instruction manual is wrong. Will return and very disappointed.
 Great fan for the price. Have all the features we wanted.
 Love this fan.  Its my second one.  Got one in living room and bedroom.
 This is a great fan for the price. I read some reviews where they said it wasn't quiet....not sure what they were expecting but this fan is VERY quiet for the amount of air it moves.
 A fantastic purchase
 Great fan. Works well and very quiet.
 Great and silent
 I like it. Easy to assemble. It could be more powerful. I later found a better one. But i guess this one is okay.
 very efficient
 Great fan with great features!
 cooled us off in nyc heat
 The noise is really annoying, especially when u try to sleep. The screws are hard to fit in, which results in the unstable stand. Highly not recommend. Not worth the money.
 It was a gift for my father &amp; he &amp; my mother are using it all the time.  It's very quiet.
 worked fine for about 7 months now it stopped moving side to side fan still works though kinda bummed for the price it didnt even last a year
 Very pleased with the output of this fan. It's not whisper quiet, but no more loud than a ceiling fan. Has 3 levels of speed an multiple time settings for automatically turning off. Came assembled other than the base which needs to be screwed on. Unfortunately, our fan was missing the package of 6 so we had to call Lasko to send a set. When calling in to Customer Service, I waited on hold for over 10 minutes before finally deciding to just take the call-back option (which said I would not lose my place in line). I was called well over an hour later -- lost track at that point. The CS Rep was very friendly and took my address to send the screws by mail. She never apologized for the company's lack of QC in not packing the screws in the first place. I still give the product a good rating as it works well &amp; has a one-year warranty.
 Quiet and working well thus far! Will come back and review if things go awry.
 Works very well. Like the three speeds, option for rotation, the remote signal is a bit weak as it can't seem to be more than 10 feet from the fan itself for it to work, but that's not a deal breaker for me. Haven't tried using it in the bedroom on low while trying to sleep yet but I'm a light sleeper so don't really know that I will be able to sleep with it on low. It isn't a "quiet" fan, but I don't know of any that are. I wouldn't call it noisy - just typical of this type of fan. Well worth the money in my opinion.
 The remote control did not seem to transmit the signal well. I got a replacement from Lasko but that did not work much better.
 This fan is absolutely phenomenal, I am surprised it works so great. However, I must say that it isn't all that great when the temperature outside it 90 degrees or higher.
 Works as advertised
 Worked well, happy with purchase
 It is quiet and it moves the air very effectively.
 Brought two, one for the bedroom. Nice &amp; quiet, really keeps the air circulating. Base is somewhat flimsy but works both on floor &amp; carpet, good for the price
 this is a second try, first was a total bust from Bed&amp;Behind.  This one is quiet and moves air well in low slow whisper quiet.  Not sure of the ION setting.
 I love this thing. It works almost too well, it was my hero during the most recent heat wave.
 This is the best floor fan I have ever purchased.  We bought an additional one for another room.
 Quiet, simple design, love the remote feature.
 I really like this fan.  It is quiet and efficient.  The room stays cool even when the windows are closed (because I live in a Very noisy area).
 Azul<br/>I love it ,very quiet,working well<br/>My advice ,go ahead buy it,you will not regret.<br/>Lasko great brand,good luck
 Fan works as described.  Like the sleek appearance and remote control.
 This is a very sleak design unit. My brother is going to be using this in his college dorm room. He was very excited.
 Love it ! Works great
 Screws that attach to the base did not come with the order.
 Awesome product !!
 It's the perfect addition to any room during Florida summers, and the ionizer is an awesome addition. It's quiet enough to have in while watching tv, but it also makes enough of a wind sound to put my wife and I asleep.
 Not as good as The Honeywell Breeze at a comparable price. Rotation is limited and fan power is mediocre.
 This is my second Lasko fan. Works very well. I like having the remote. Nice looking too.
 love it
 very good
 Would definitely buy another one.  Quiet and love the settings, especially the timer.  Perfect height, light weight for easy moving from room-to-room when needed
 The fan is powerful and quiet.
 Sturdy and powerful, noise level is fine.
 Works great, love it!
 Good fan, doesn't blow as hard as I expected, but it gets the job done.
 Works perfectly fine. Great fan.
 my son loves this, really cools the room
 Fan lasted 3 months and ran maybe 3 hours.
 Fan noise level is low as expected.  Fan volume or output good.  Fan radius or area coverage (maybe 25-30%) poor at best.
 GREAT FAN!
 Love it
 Works even better than advertised.  Tall but still has a relatively small signature in the room.
 I love this fan. It's quiet, has 3 speeds, auto cut off, very safe, no danger.
 Great tower fan.  This is the second one my family bought. We all like this model.  Strongly recommend this fan to all.
 We really liked this fan. It  takes less space and have less noise.
 good
 Great fan but a little loud. Does a good job of cooling off the room.
 Good product. Air flow pretty strong with 3 speed and low noise
 This is an awesome fan. The first one that I bought 3 years ago still works. The fan is quiet when it rotates, and the remote control is a genius.  I can fall asleep with ease because it also has a timer.  Thanks, Lasko!  Please keep making more of this.  :)
 Great fan, very sturdy, quiet.  Bought another one.
 1. It creaks loudly while rotating, which defeats the purpose for us, we use a fan to fall asleep.  This actually kept us awake.<br/>2. The remote control came with a broken button.<br/>3. The lowest fan setting is still too strong for a gentle nighttime air circulation.<br/><br/>The 2 stars are for the positive points:<br/>1. the assembly was easy<br/>2. it actually did function as a fan<br/>3. it's reasonably attractive<br/><br/>There was no way to overcome these major flaws in both product design and execution.<br/><br/>Buyer beware--jeers also go to Amazon for having a very short window for returning this device.  By the time we unpacked it, assembled it, determined the noise was too much and that the remote control was broken, and finally got our act together to return it, the return window was closed and we're just stuck with it.  It's a rare customer service miss for Amazon and I'm not sure I'd buy this type of thing from Amazon again for this reason.  By contrast, Costco takes returns on things like this forever basically.
 Taller than expected, heavy flow of air with NO ANNOYING NOISES. I definitely recommend this product.
 Received on second attempt (first was via UPS to non-doorman building which proved fatal, however sending to work address was great). Amazon staff were great at resending another fan for me, and it works very well indeed. Tall, reasonably powerful and not noisy at all. Will be a blessing when the summer arrives.
 It's quiet and works well. The fan doesn't give a strong breeze but will keep us cool if we are sitting in front of it.
 I own 4 brands of tower and regular oscillating fans (I live in Hawaii) and im disappointed in this fan that I just received. The highest level setting (3) is weaker than a Level 1 on the other fans that I have. I used it throughout the day and also night time where temperature here is about 72 degrees. I like the look of the fan and it's very quiet. Other than that, it does not do its job in terms of keeping my family and I cool in this weather.
 Works great
 I can't believe how well this fan pushes air and how quiet it is to me compared to other fans at the top setting.  I put this in a corner near my dogs beds and it circulates the area perfectly...they love the constant breeze.  The footprint is small so it takes up less space than a normal Fan.  I am just amazed at how far away I can still feel the breeze from this fan...it pushes air that well.  I plan to replace my other two house fans with this one.
 Great fan!  Its quiet and does a good job of cooling the room.
 I bought this product about 1 month ago.  I have had no problems with this unit what so ever.  It has performed as advertised.  I would recommend this to my friends and family.  It was easy to put together.
 This fan works well. It's quiet and has great range. Only thing is the sensor on the remote, if you don't get it just right it won't work.
 Perfect fan for my needs! Not very loud, Ion feature is great. Light for the Ion is a little bright but easy to get past.
 We bought this fan at the beginning of the summer to help cool one of our upstairs rooms that the AC unit doesn't quite reach. We love it so much that we bought a second one for our bedroom! We don't find it to be too noisy. It is just a wind noise that is pretty nice while you're sleeping. The remote is very handy so I can turn it off before climbing out of my warm bed! The blue light that people spoke of in other reviews is definitely bright at night, but it is only on if the ionizer option is selected.
 The fan worked for a month and then just stopped working.  It won't turn on
 Quiet but wasn't getting the 10x10 bedroom cold. Just a nice breeze. Wish I bought a cheaper fan that blows better. A good fan if you want silence
 These work great
 We love this fan, quiet opperation. this is the third fan of this model we have bought. would buy again
 I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED with the new fan.  It’s HUMMMMMM is louder than my TV.  The new fan is in a bedroom, the HUMMMMMM can be heard from the hallway, before the room is entered.  I have the same fan model, which I have used for over four years.  The only sound the old fan made was the whoosh of air.  Recently the old unit developed an occasional rattle that startles me awake at night; to be expected, based on constant use for multiple years.  I thought the first unit was so awesome, I purchased another just like it.  But the HUMMMMMM of the new fan is intolerable.  Wearing ear plugs that reduce sound by 20% doesn’t help diminish the HUMMMMMM.  I am not in a situation where I can return the fan due to its size, or afford to take the $61 plus hit.  I will try running the new fan outside, out of hearing, for several days and hope the HUMMMMMM goes away.  In the mean-time, I had to spend another $44 in-order to have a fan for use, within the next two days.
 A lot of power and fairly quiet. Liked it so much I bought a second one. Comes with a remote control.
 The first product was damaged due to shipping and immediately was sent a new one. Works great. A little noisy but great value purchase!!
 Great fan, fairly quiet, easy to set up and use.
 This fan just SAVE MY LIFE from 95 degree summer!!!! Love it, it's quiet, and doesn't take much space, awesome for my tiny bedroom!
 Initally this fan worked perfectly well for a couple of months. Later on, it deteroriated to a level where it continuously made a resonating noise to a level that one cant even watch TV or talk over the phone. It was very embarassing for us when it first started to make noises when we had guests visiting our place. This is a product that can be categorized in use and throw within a year. Instead I would prefer buying some cheaper options on costco.
 Nice fan, works great. Wind projection is soft and quiet. I recommend this unit for small to medium size rooms.
 Powerful while being quiet, the LED indicator for the ION mode is very bright in the dark, may interfere with sleep.
 Seriously like having NASA send you a home size rocket. The thing is so freaking big. But keeps things cool and the air flowing
 Very quiet and doesn't take up much space (wide). Loving it so far. The remote and sleep timer is a great feature too.
 Best fan- i ever had
 The best and quietest fan ever used
 Excellent. Quiet. Cools us down wonderfully.
 So far, fan works great and at low setting provides very acceptable white noise.
 Fan is ver quite and does the job.<br/>So far we are happy , the only thing I want complain is it feels not that sturdy B'coz of its length.
 Stopped working after a few months (2) and now past return time to return.  I do not recommend.
 Perfect and it's very quiet and look great<br/>Surpassed my expectations
 Love it!
 works perfect...bought 3 of them
 It works great for us and takes up little room. Also very quiet.
 Just an ok fan for the price.
 I liked it. Works great!
 This fan has good air pressure and cooling power overall. Pros cons below.<br/>Pros:<br/>-cools well with a variety of speeds for the fan<br/>- tall so air travel is dispersed well for small rooms.<br/>- rotating capability<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-tilts in the base slightly so a bit wobbly<br/>- heavy but definitely able to be easily pulled down by children<br/>- not a fan of the fake wood detail but that's personal preference
 this was a good looking and great fan. i bought one then 2 more after the first one.<br/>well worth the price for a quality good looking fan
 We've had 2 of these for about a month now.  So far both are great!  They move a lot of air quietly, and we love the timer function.
 This fan is awesome!  It cooled my bedroom down quickly on the hottest of summer days.  Total A +
 Amazing fan! Remote has worked great without any issues so far, and the fan itself is strong and ventilates the whole room well.
 great
 Blows in my room all day. Love it at night. It does collect dust, but what wouldn't?
 Love the fan the remote fell and broke immediately
 I recently purchased this item and it is everything for me.  No complaints and it was very easy to connect the stand on the bottom.
 output is too low
 It's an OK product.  I like how there are 3 different power settings and a very versatile timer.  Only thing I wish that were different about this was 1. The remote controller doesn't really respond well...It takes at least 3 clicks for the fan to register... 2. I wish they had an even lower power setting because I think it's pretty loud especially when I use it during my naps...
 Awesome !
 This is a great product - powerful and quiet - I couldn't be happier!
 Kicks out a fair amount of air and the remote is nice, but it's a little loud for using in the bedroom. Mine had a strange whirring at first that faded over time, but it has a slight high pitched whistle on high. Gets the job done, though.
 The turn radius is less than 90 degrees. The remote control distance is less than 10 ft. Otherwise the functionality is as described.
 I really like these fans.  They are very quiet, though  tall takes up little space and very easy to operate.  Love the ION feature.
 Wow! Very powerful, actually so much, it's more than I need. I will be keeping it though because of it's excellence
 Love the remote.
 good product, very satisfied
 Wasn't really sure if it was cleaning the air until my son went a whole night without sneezing or coughing.  Absolutely quiet blue light is really bright but it didn't bother me.
 Love this fan! It keeps the room nice and cool and I love the settings and features.
 Became very loud over time...
 Did not regret this purchase at all.  I love it because it's quiet and does not take up a lot of space. Highly recommend this product.
 Really good!
 Loved this fan, actually circulates all the air just as well as an overhead fan.
 Perfect! My son loves it in his apartment. Works great!
 Reviews were on track.  Excellent fan, quiet and does the job.
 I don't like it. Could you supply me with a return address so that I could send it back and get a better. this one has only 3 speed and it is not strong.
 Good fan
 Best fan I've ever owned. Not sure if the ION feature actually does anything, but it makes me feel good knowing that I use it. So, there
 FANtastic!!!
 Good fan, pretty quiet. Easy to put together.
 Fan works fantastic. The remote only works if you are standing an inch away from the fan.
 this item is not at all as quiet as the one a friend of mine has and it is the same product, so I am not at all very happy with this product, but it costs to much to send it back.
 Easy to assemble. Works well. Pretty quiet.
 Got this fan for my daughters room and it works great! I have to cover it at night because the blue light is really bright.
 The fan works fine and is quiet.  I partially purchased the fan because of the ionizer.  However, I am unclear as to what this ionizer does.  There does not appear to be a filter or collection bars for the ionized air and it does not appear to be as effective in cleaning the air as room ionizers I have previously purchased.  When used in close conjunction with a room ionizer with collection bars, it seems to make the make the collection bars in the room ionizer more effective.
 Much more quiet than other fans we have bought. Does not blow hard but sufficient for our need.
 I like this fan very much but it did not come with screws to attach base to fan. I had to go to hardware store. It is wobbly but works. Could you send me the screws?
 This fan is great, the only complaint that i can come up with is that it doesn't rotate quite as far as our old Lasko fan. The solution was to put it in the bedroom where the quietness is much more appreciated anyway. It is easy to assemble, and the remote is a handy accessorie.
 Exactly what I was looking for. Easy to assemble the base and easy to use.  Cools off nicely and remote is an added bonus.  No problems so far and would recommend.
 The many speeds of the fan are good. The remote makes it extremely to use.  I only wish I had  considered some of the units with more of the levels and perks.  I would definitely recommending this to others,
 I have a small room and it's okay nothing amazing not extra powerful but it was bigger than I expected
 Excellent fan.  Fast shipping.  Great !
 This is just a tower fan, nothing more. It does NOT cool the temperature in your household whatsoever. It is just a tall weak fan. Don't waste your money like I did and buy this fan expecting it to cool down your room. I would give it a good rating (because honestly it doesn't say anywhere that it cools air, but it DOES show up as the 5th item on Amazon if you search "Air Cooler") BUT it is a weak fan that BARELY even oscillates. This fan MIGHT have a 30 degree oscillation radius. Do not buy this item.
 The fan works very well, appreciate the timer and oscillation modes.  Very quiet operations and takes up very little space.
 If you suffer from allergies I highly recommend you get this. It cleans the air, I honestly noticed a difference in how much dust settles.I like how it has a timer too.
 Noisest fan I have ever had. This is the second fan . The first one did the same thing it knocks inside like something is bent or loose. I am going to take it apart and try and fix it. Apparently amazon is shipping defective fans as new.
 I've been using standard blade fans for my whole life so I decided to give this a try.<br/><br/>1. The fan adequately cools my room.<br/><br/>2. It's clearly audible, but the sound it creates isn't annoying.  The sound is more soothing than anything else.<br/><br/>3. It's easy to move around as it's not heavy and there's a grip at the top of the fan.<br/><br/>Overall I'm quite pleased with this fan and would recommend it if you need to keep a small room cool.
 I like this item because it has been all that I expected it to be?
 Great fan, we all love it!  Puts out cold air and good circulation / vents room well.  The dogs love it too!
 Love this fan.  pushes air without being as loud as our box fan.  we leave it on all the time.
 We use it in an upstairs bedroom that is not A-C. It is great and we sleep cool all night. Especially like the rotating and that is QUIET!
 Works grateful have no problems with it.<br/>A wonderful purchase
 very quiet perfect airflow circles whole living room would reccomend this product. I rarely use the ion button. If looking for a tower fan this is it
 very satisfied with our wind curve fan.
 Broke within a month
 This fan is a total piece of junk, so I have no idea how it has such high ratings. We had this fan for TWO days before it started making a very loud rattling noise, whether oscillating or not. The other awesome "feature" is the ionizer...that is if you want to have a rave in the middle of the night. The blue LED light that turns on with this feature is SO BRIGHT I don't know how anyone could sleep without having a seizure. I should have expected this from a lasko product after we bought a lasko small space heater/fan that burned out after a year.
 Does the job and takes up less space than regular fans
 First of all, this item arrived not in new condition. It was obvious that this item was previously opened, used and then unassembled. If I pay for a new item, then I should receive a new item in original unopened factory packaging.<br/><br/>Secondly, this fan is only good if your room is no bigger than 10ft x 10ft. max. Also, the motor inside is little noisy especially if you are sitting 4-5ft from the fan (makes a clicking sound when runs). I had purchased this fan after reading several great reviews.<br/><br/>Would not recommend if you are looking for a powerful fan for your large room.
 Quick delivery and WOW this thing PUMPS air! Super happy with my purchase and absolutely recommend :)
 Works great. Cools extremely well. Currently in the bedroom. Buying a second one for the living room.
 This fan is great.  I haven't had it for very long so I cannot comment on it's longevity, but it is very powerful.  My old fan we had to keep on high while me and my fiancee slept, however this fan is almost too strong on the second of the three levels.  The sound is comforting to sleep to and will be great for blowing around cool air in the summer.
 Works as advertised
 This is an amazing fan!  Super quiet even ok highest setting and gives a nice output even across the room!
 So far so good! The air flow is nice and strong. I have a fairly large room and it definitely helps since Florida Summer is already in swing here. Wasn't hard to put together, and is fairly quiet.<br/><br/>Possible con: I don't see much of a difference in the 3 settings. I noticed it was getting too cold so I turned it down to the first setting, and didn't see any change. But that wasn't a big enough deal to me to take off a star.
 I am 100% satisfied with this fan. It puts out a strong amount of air and I use it in a large bedroom. I would highly recommend it.
 Money well spent
 Works well but it's a little noisy
 This fan is quiet and it does a great job. Very pleased.
 Great
 We've had two older Lasko tower fans for several years... liked them both. One was damaged during some work being done in the house. Ordered this new fan as a replacement. Disappointed. The fan looks nicer than our older model, is a little heavier, a somewhat more solid build, and it's a bit quieter. But... the airflow is less, and the oscillating mode travels a much narrower arc. I will also add that I've been around ionizers before, and the ionizer mode on this fan does not impress me... I can tell no difference between the mode being on or off, other than the light. Will I return it. No. Would I buy another one? No.
 it had a crack on the top side , but still works perfectly
 Very pleased. Highly recommend! Powerful and quiet - we are ordering another!
 Excellent fan! It's quiet and keeps the room very comfortable on warm days.
 moves a lot of air and seems to be of good lasting quality would buy another
 Great settings, looks nice and very quiet!
 Fan was great but it took over 3 weeks to get here
 Works great and feels like an air conditioner
 I researched fans for a long time. I wanted one that wouldn't take up alot of room and that was quiet. This hits all my pluses. I love the remote :-) Quiet fan, throws out some great cold air. Price was great, I can't say enough good. I will probably order another for another room in our house. Blue Ion light doesn't bother me in the least. Would definitely recommend this product
 I kind of dislike because the fan doesn't blow that hard
 Fabulous! Just what I needed.
 Quiet yet powerful! Love it.
 I have two of these and it works great during hot summer days.  My dogs lay in front of this to stay cool in the 90 degree summer days.
 Really nice, pretty quiet, and strong settings. Very happy with this!
 I love it... Easy to assemble and met my expectations!
 This is a great fan! I use it in spare room now I want one in my room!! Sometimes its hit or miss with Amazon but this is great!!! 7 stars.
 The fan is very attractive and preforms well. If you are looking for a tower fan you can't go wrong with this one
 Great fan - quiet, good adjustability and oscillation!
 i like this ,it looks beutiful and it is not voice  . i putted  this one on my room.The few day I found the warltmart was cheaper than this..it was same fan..
 Thought this remote-controlled fan was the solution I needed for my garage.  Airlfow was weak.  Oscillation range was narrow.  Base was unstable.  Returned.
 I love it the color is great,looks great with my hardwood floor.I bought the used one ,looked new,wish the fan had more power,still very happy.
 Had opened the box was in good condition but when I went to plug it in it burnt out in less then 1 minute now it doesn't work at all
 This fan is much better than I expected.<br/>It really does the trick and pretty quite too!<br/>Love the remote.
 Performs as expected. Has not only helped with power bill, but no longer have to fight with roommate over thermostat. ;-)
 Stopped working after one month
 Easy to use.  Takes very little space and is quiet.
 I enjoy the fan it tall enough to be placed on the floor but at the same time still able to reach mid level of the room. It blows cool enough air and has an ionizer filter for those who has relatives or roomates that smoke; that is also good in dat case.. Its also sheek and easy to wipe down appose to takin it apart to clean.... I love it you sould get 1 or more for the house...
 Bought it during a heat wave when the whole town was out, saved my life!<br/>I recommend it if you want a quieter fan
 Works Great - Very Quiet
 Love this fan!
 This Lasko fan is simply great!!! We have used  it in our kitchen with 88-90  F outside. And fan did its job just excellent!!! It made us feel very comfortable. We are very happy with this purchase.
 Works well and is very quiet, but the plastic base feels flimsy. I hope it holds up over time.
 A bit loud but worth it!<br/><br/>Moves the air and performs as specified. Could be used in large room.<br/><br/>Intend to purchase from this seller again! Darn good service.<br/><br/>Mjt
 -Remote is a wonderful feature<br/>-The fan is a bit lound in my opinion, but that is probably because its so strong<br/>-Only three settles and even the smallest setting is a bit strong at times<br/>-Still would recommend this fan to anyone interested
 fits in small rooms
 Works perfectly and kept us comfortable during one of the hottest Seattle summers.  Highly recommend!
 I did not get screws with it. I had to go to Home Depot to fix the stand. Little disappointed
 worked great while it worked but ceased working after 4 weeks.
 Perfect. 5 stars.
 Nice effective fan. I wish it was quieter though.
 Lasko 2551 Wind Curve Platinum Tower Fan makes a little too noisy even at lowest speed but so far meets our need.
 Works great. Have Lasko's thru out my house.
 This is our SECOND time we've purchased this fan - because it's SO COOL (PUN intended). It's quiet - sleek - the remote control is handy - we keep this on all the time and even with the bedroom - it's quiet enough that it doesn't distract! Highly recommend it.
 This fan is well built and sturdy.  It looks nice enough to place in your living room.  I would recommend this fan.
 Love it
 Best fan ever!!
 Great buy!
 Was expecting more for the price I paid.  It's probably good for a small room.  I'm a bit disappointed.
 We are buying the tower fan for the first time. Very impressed. Works as specified and a best value for the money.
 I bought this 42 inch tower fan &amp; It is powerful yet no sound like my other tower fan or pedestal fans. The options of auto switch off really works well for us.<br/>The remote storage space is another nice feature I've observed in it<br/>The fan is very sturdy &amp; safe to be in the living room with my 2 small kids around unlike other tower fans which tumbles even with a light push..<br/>I got this delivered in a day - appreciate their speed on delivery.<br/>I would recommend this fan for anyone who is looking for a sturdy base &amp; body, breezy air with no sound &amp; the air ionizer
 I purchased my first Lasko tower fan a few months ago and loved it and so I bought 4 more of this newer model - this one has a nicer finish. The fan is light and easy to assemble - took less than 5 minutes. I like using the highest fan setting which produces a strong breeze.<br/><br/>This unit has 'ionizer' feature and a remote - I have not used either.
 I'm happy with how tall and sleek the fan looks but after two days of use the fan started to make a scratching sound on the oscillate mode.... After not using it for a week it stopped making noise. I still don't use it on oscillation. Besides that, love it!
 This fan is excellent!! Worth every penny!
 Great for its price. Works perfect so far.
 Keeps me cool &amp; does it quietly, I absolutely love it😍🌬❄️💨👍🏽😁🙌🏽!!!!
 I am very happy with this fan - it moves a lot of air very quietly.  I have the fan sitting in the corner of my home office and the fan allows me to keep the home air conditioning several degrees warmer.  Even at the lowest (of 3) settings, there is a very nice breeze.  Highly recommend this!
 Works great!
 Works well for the basic functions, but not as good as I expect. A few issues:<br/><br/>1. You dont know if the remote  button command is received by the fan. You have to wait for the fan to act and know. It would be better if there is a light to flash if the fan gets the instruction from remote.<br/><br/>2. The angle is too narrow: probably only 30 degree. It cannot cover the room if I put it at a corner.<br/><br/>3. The noise: it does produce some noise.
 Have this in my living room and it's great for the room size, about 15 x 20. Love the remote control. Only problem was the screws for the mounting stand were not included.
 Makes this awful creaking noise every 30 seconds or so. Does it even when not oscillating, so that's not it. Does it at all 3 speeds, so that's not it. Does it whether the ionizer is on or off, so that's not it.<br/><br/>When it's not creaking it's pretty quiet, but 5 seconds of creaking for 30 seconds of quiet isn't worth it.<br/><br/>EDIT: Took the fan apart, soaked it in WD-40, and put it back together. Still rattles, though not quite as much. I think I'm just gonna send it back.
 Exceptional product with exceptional performance.  Would highly recommend.
 Great
 Love it. Nice flow of air that can be felt across a room. Very little noise made
 Luv it
 I will never buy a fan on amazon again. I got this on April fools day and it just died this morning.  Only 3 months and I paid $60 and can't return it bc return is only 30 days.  I am so mad. This is such bs. Read the fine print clearly. I will only buy where I can return it in person. Very DISGUSTED with this policy.
 My fan arrived in a timely manner, it was to easy to assemble, and it works great. I occasionally use the ionizer when my neighbors are stinky, and it gets the job done. Also, it maybe a little loud , but I live in the noisy city so it's not too bad. Great Fan.
 I am not typing all these stupid forms, it is a decent product, it cools the living space that I have to cool, That's All!
 Great fan, we liked it so well that we ordered another one for the bedroom.
 Don't waste your money. Buy a small bracket fan, because that's about how much air this fan moves. I had the Lasko #4930 35" and it died after 2 years. It would really push some air, but it just didn't last. If I had purchased the 2554 42" locally, I would take it back. After buying two Lasko fans, I can honestly say I would not purchase anything they make again.
 Perfect! This Fan is perfect! Thank you 5 stars on everything!!
 Works great, have three and use almost everyday depending on hot weather.  Recommend to anyone.  Very good product.
 I already purchased this item and I love it.  However, when I bought another one, the one I got did not work.  I tried everything I could to make it work and nothing.  Nada...  I had already destroyed the packaging, so according to Amazon I am out of luck...  it's an odd shaped and large item so I really don't know what I can do.  It pisses me off
 Far too loud. I buy a lot of stuff online and do extensive research prior, so I though this fan would be great... However, this item did not live up to expectations. Experiencing the rattling noise that some other reviewers have mentioned. I can bear using it during the day, but nighttime is a definite no go as it keeps me up even though I'm quite possibly the heaviest sleeper in the world.
 GREAT
 I loved this fan, but after 2 years it died on me. I feel like I will never love again. So sad.
 This fan is great it can do anything and really cools the room down on #1 fan and it can go up to #3.  LOVE IT
 It is not what I thought, it is good only if you are sitting in front of it, I have two other Lasko, but High Velocity, I wish I would have stuck with that one, they really work, if I had the box and the time to play around sending it back, I would, but I wanted to let anyone else thinking about this one, NOT to buy,
 It's larger and louder than I anticipated but works well. Love the remote. LF
 Good design and the functionality is good.
 Very comfortable reliable fan
 Working very well!
 This fan met all my expectations! It has been a month since I have purchased this. I needed this for my 1 month old baby and it works perfectly without making any noise.
 great fan
 I waited 30 years for a fan this powerful!
 great product
 Works great and quiet. Replaced a Honeywell tower fan that only lasted a year. I also have a Lasko fan in my bathroom that has lasted a good three years so far.
 Just as expected based on past reviews--effective, attractive, quiet, easy to operate.  Perfect for small spaces and does not blow papers around on my desk.
 nice fan. really like this one.
 This gets the room cool despite the fact it's a fan
 After about one month's use the fan started rattling non-stop. The rattling is actually louder than the fan itself. I can get it to temporarily stop rattling if I push the two pieces (front and back) of the fan together tightly, but it starts rattling again after a few minutes. My wife and I were so irritated with how loud the rattling became, that in the middle of the night, we tried to tightly wrap panty hose around it to see if we could get it to stop. We were definitely sleep deprived at that point. I hate giving products low stars because it was a great fan at first, but it's just way too noisy to keep on at night, which is the only time I really use it. I will not consider purchasing another in the future.
 This fan is very quite however is not as powerful as I would like it to be.
 I really enjoyed this summer with this fun
 Quiet. Love oscillating option.<br/>Good value
 Easy assembly, pushes a lot of air, relatively quiet.
 I received the product appx a week ago,however weather in NY being quite cool,didn't open the box until yesterday. Unfortunately, there is no screw at all with the package, so I have to call them and ask for the screws, I had some screws at home but those did not work and I don't want to go for a screw hunt.<br/>I made it stand with the help of the wall and the chair and turned it on, it feels nice and gives good amount of cool air,<br/><br/>I will update my review based on customer service once I sort that part out,<br/>It has been 2 weeks and I am still waiting for the screws,so the tower is balanced with make shift support, it cant stand by itself because it doesnt have a base and bottom is not flat either.<br/>It cools great but I think I waited long enough for silly screws, so will return and order another one, sorry!
 It's not the most powerful fan, but it's quiet. I have a small place, so it's adequate. And it has a remote, which is pretty convenient.
 Nice fan
 Truly a godsend!
 Great Fan, easy assembly and extremely quite. Would like a little more power but it does the trick.
 Sam is very weak with very little power
 love it
 every thing works fine except the remote control does not work at all.
 Works great. Very quite.<br/>Will buy another soon.
 Works great!!!
 Qquiet and does great job moving air around.  Thanks!
 I received this fan today. Set it up, plugged it in. I don't understand how people rate this fan so highly. I have a 30$ cheapo walmart fan that puts out 5x more air than this on HI. For $50, I was expecting a LOT more. I plan on sending this POS fan back and picking up another 30$ one from walmart. Do not spend your money on this fan. It's not worth the money. Pick up a cheap one.
 Great, keeps everything in a few feet refreshingly cool. Enjoy!
 Very effective fan for uniform circulation in the room
 I could not put this item together, so had to return it.
 I chose this rating for several reasons. The product was easy to setup and get running. The simplicity of the control layout and that of the remote made it easy to understand. I loved everything about it.
 Love it
 Fairly quiet but not as powerful as I was hoping.
 Im a college student who doesnt have AC or fan in a triple room. So I needed this fan. It's quiet, good speed. doesn't rotate to a big angle though... but overall its good
 Does what it's supposed to. Love the remote.
 The fan is modern looking as well as a great product also many friends ask about it. Love this fan!
 Works exactly as described. The remote has been great.
 Works very well. Reviews are accurate. It's perfect for a small bedroom fan for extra summer cooling, especially to circulate air at night or nap time. It's very quiet and does not rattle. The remote works well. The only drawback is wishing the difference between high and low was greater. Wish High was a bit stronger and low was a bit milder. Good purchase. Worth the money.
 love it
 This fan is great. It had every feature I was looking for; three speeds, it oscillates, has an ionized, and best of all a timer.
 I own this since last summer and it works just fine. No noise only refreshing air. :)
 Very nice, but not as quiet as I thought it would be.  However, I like the remote and the oscillation.
 Good size, not too loud. Perfect for a bedroom. I agree with everyone else that the blue light from Ion  feature is quite bright, but not a huge deal.
 Arrived in perfect shape, moves a great amount of air, and I think it's pretty quiet
 There amazing!!!! Got three for each room
 Nice air flow, easily movable, very quiet.  Ionizer is a nice touch.  Deducted 1 star because the way you set the timer is silly.
 Very quiet. Remote is good from long range.
 love the fan.  it works very well and cools down the place very nicely.  Love the timer option and remote!
 Great price value, wish it was a taller
 Quiet operation but awesome air flow. Had a similar fan made by other company but this model far exceeded any.
 Great product!
 Not as powerful as I thought it would be for a larger room but still gives a good breeze in my small home office.
 Totally worth the price. Should sell it for closer to $100. The ion setting is great.
 Its sleek, easy to use, and love the remote.
 I love these fans
 Purchased as a wedding gift from the couple's registry. They were delighted. Arrived quickly and well packaged.<br/>Other reviews on this item were good. Would be interested in purchasing this item for myself.
 I bought two of these after my sister recommended them. The timer is great for when I want it shut it off when I'm sleeping. Its fairly quiet, but two of them in the same room makes quite a bit of noise.
 I chose this fan after reviewing many and having had a different model Lasko in the past, I thought I would be just as pleased with this one as I was the other.  The real selling point was the ionizer on it and the price seemed reasonable.  Per my rating, it's obvious that I am EXTREMELY displeased with this fan.  It has ZERO power and isn't worth the energy to run it.  I do NOT recommend this product.  Of course, I missed the cut-off for returning it and there's no e-mail to even contact anyone to discuss a replacement, thinking perhaps I got a dud.
 I'm a big fan of this fan
 Love this fan! It is powerful but quiet at the same time. Glad I purchased it
 I first bought this fan in 2005 and it lasted a decade before the wiring and motor went bad. It was used nearly year-round, as I'm in the desert. Needless to say, I was impressed with the quality of this product. So when it finally died, I didn't even think of getting another brand or model.<br/>But that was a mistake. When I plugged it in and turned it on the new fan's motor started humming like it was installed improperly or about to die. MOTORS SHOULD NOT BE HUMMING. I capitalized that to stress its importance. Humming motor = problem. I returned the fan and upon googling the manufacturer, I found, to my surprise, they are not a stranger to their fans catching fire. This model was not recalled due to "potential electrical failure in the fan motor  that] can pose a fire hazard," but given the obvious defect of the motor in the fan I received and the history of the company, I'm worried.<br/>Maybe I'm over-reacting. Maybe I received a lemon. Maybe these fans will catch fire and cause damage and death. IDK. I do know I'm not buying another product from this manufacturer. 0/10 would not recommend.
 Great buy!
 quiet and efficient gets the job done. worth every penny of it.the only downside is I can't tell the difference if the ion is working.
 This is great. Very efficient, attractive and takes up very little space.
 Excellent price, nice stream of air, doesn't seem to dry out tired eyes like the old-fashioned fan we had. Stable and easy to position and move.
 Great fan for cooking down a bedroom.
 I am very happy with it
 I purchased this product based on its small floor footprint, air handling volume, and quite honestly because of its design - it was safe to use around my two German shepherds. It was a good purchase.
 This is a very nice fan.  Good supportive base.  Not as quiet as I expected from what I had read.  Good replacement for my old tower fan that broke at the base.
 The fan is great. The remote is useless. Literally have to be standing close enough to reach the buttons on the machine for the remote to work. Otherwise it's a great product.
 This fan is everything it claims to be. This unit replaced an older model that served me well for many years and I expect this fan to do the same.
 This is a wonderful fan. We use it daily to keep the air circulating in a room without a ceiling fan. It is not too loud. You can hear it, but I find it a nice and fairly quiet noise when sleeping -- just know that it's not silent, but it's not loud. It's very durable and we have had two of these for years and they work great. I would definitely recommend.
 Nice and quiet, does not wake up my children at all
 No complaints. Works nice. Output at level 1 is enough for most standard sized rooms. Remote is a plus !!<br/>Nice product
 Nice looking, inobtrusive; easy to operate, effective.
 Fan seems great... But it requires 8 screws. Mine came with two
 Maybe it's the Florida weather but this fan isn't as amazing as I hoped for.
 I've had a Lasko for about 7 yrs now so I thought I would stick with that company and I like my decision.<br/>Not only does it look nice but its nice and quiet. I Highly recommend this
 Love this fan. Quite but powerful. Sturdy and have had it for 7 months.
 This fan is perfect for our room. Height of the fan is just what we needed and it circulates air in the room.
 The fan is quiet and was easy to assemble. We're going to purchase a second fan for our upstairs.
 Very good fan
 Great fan. Lots of control
 Very low air even when its on HIGH. The size is good but the product sucks.
 Way too noisy! Even on the lowest setting I can still hear the buzz of the motor from one room away, with a wall in between. Not the sound of the air but the actual motor or mechanism vibrating. I have an older Lasko fan from a similar but different model and that one has no noise issues. It might be I just have a bad unit but it looks like other reviewers are experiencing the same thing with recent purchases.<br/><br/>On the plus side, it does push a decent amount of wind at the highest setting and if you don't mind the noise it's a decent deal on a fan but I'm likely going to have to return it. I don't normally post reviews but buyer beware because if I had known it was going to be this noisy I wouldn't have bought it.
 This is a very good fan..value for the money!! GIves a very nice cooling effect even in the lowest speeds..thank you for a valuable product
 Love it! Works wonderfully
 Had my first Lasko fan ten years ago. I would not have any other kind. THE BEST....
 Amazing
 Loved the first one so much, we purchased a second one! Love them both.
 Nice and quiet. Love that it rotates! It really is a great product and does what it says it does.
 the only drawback are the fan speeds, high is not high. Overall it does cool the bedroom
 I have owned this fan for just around 2 months, great Fan looks great on hardwood floors with the matching wood, and makes no noise.  Only thing that i dislike is the fact that the Remote has to be pointed exactly to the right corner for it to work.  I have to try multiple times before I can get the remote to change speed or even turn the fan on.
 This fan really works...you should get this one.
 I don't know what I did without it!  Best fan I have ever purchased.  So worth the money!  It is so quiet and helps me sleep.
 This fan is a nice fan. It does have a bit of a noise but nothing bad, sounds like a white noise machine.  Since we got this for my sons room that works out perfect.  The fan output is great and the ionizer is a nice bonus. With stinky boys sometimes I run the ionizer. ;)
 I love this fellow.  It works like a charm, does everything I ask it to do.  I really don't need the air conditioner on as much, I am sure it will pay for itself.  How did I ever get along without it?  It's A+++++++
 Works god.  Just what I needed.
 Excellent fan, very happy for hot days with no a/c.
 Works great! Not too noisy and really cools me off at night.
 Exactly what I wanted. Quiet!
 We ordered this fan to replace a big, ugly, oscillating fan we had in the den.  We knew someone who had a similar tower fan and we liked that one.  This one works really well.  The little blue ion light is really bright, but we don't sleep in the den, so it doesn't bother us at all.  I am thinking of getting another one for the bedroom.
 It's like having an air conditioner in the room! Love that it has a remote control and an ionizer. Was however very disappointed that the delivery person dropped the box over my 6 foot gate!! Appears to be undamaged but if it breaks or wears out quickly I'll hold Amazon's delivery service accountable.
 Exact replacement. Lived up to all expectations.
 Works great in my daughter's college bedroom.
 I actually like the look of this fan. It looks quite handsome, especially next to a brown leather couch.  The beeping noise is annoying, but other than that, it's awesome.  I like how the remote can be stored in the fan itself.
 Cools my room even during the hottest days of the summer here in Seattle!
 Encountered an issue with the most important feature - oscillation - and was unable to get in touch with Lasko customer service. After several emails and phone calls (hours on hold with repeating message encouraging me to hang up) I have finally given up and accepted the fact that my fan will never function as claimed and that Lasko will offer no support.
 I love this fan.
 Not loud and it gives great air flow.  I guess what would have made it better is if it was cheaper.
 Works well.
 These are especially handy in our living areas. Do not take up a lot of room. Quiet operation. Simple assembly.
 We love the fan - it does a great job of circulating air, is sturdy and well made.
 Fan works great, not too loud. Love the timer.  Very strong even on lowest setting.
 Died within 2 weeks. Amazon wouldn't accept return
 Loved it so much I bought two!
 Very good quiet
 Looks nice, it's slender so very easy to move.  Works well!
 This fan is fairly quiet. The problem is the longer runs the noisier it gets. It sounds like a bearing is out of whack so you'll be hearing constant clicking which becomes rather annoying even if it isn't super loud.  This is not a defect, this is Lasco fans in general.  I've brought and returned 2 others figuring they were dropped.  Go with a different brand if clicking sounds are going to annoy you.  Most people probably won't be bothered.  I'm just not most people.<br/><br/>The fan is attractive, looks very nice.
 The fan works great and it was very easy to put the stand on. The only negative thing I have to say is that it makes a little more noise than I would have liked. Not really loud mind you, but the whirring could be more quiet. I'll keep it and keep that in mind if I purchase another fan.
 Bought in May 2017, stopped working in October 2017. Have bought many floor model fans and have NEVER had one to just quit! Very disappointing! You might want to try something different and not this particular model!
 Nice fan and very satisfied with it.
 Great fan but noise
 I have been owning 2 of these for a month now. They are easy to install. Sturdy built. Look sleek. Very affordable. I recommend 5*.
 It's a nice fan
 I purchased this fan for my husband as he has COPD and it has helped his breathing.tremendously.  We put it on our porch and it is very comfortable out there.
 Shipped tower fan did not include two sets of screws required for assembly of fan base.
 I purchased my first two years ago and additional one last month.  Powerful and quiet.
 Nice
 Yes it met my expectations. I've enjoyed it in all this hot weather
 Did not come with the screws necessary to attach the base
 this fan has no screw with it so it can't even stand up! Sucks, don't buy it
 Great quality and easy to move!
 Works just like my old one which went for 8 years.
 Very satisfied with this product.
 Love it. Highly recommended this product!!! Especially if your apartment shuts off AC on you and turns on heat even though there are still 70 degree days
 looks and performs very nicely!
 Good air flow, quiet, tall, what more can you ask?
 Purchased this item to use in an office.  It is doing a very good job of circulating air in a confined space.
 Simply Awesome.
 Fast shipping, great product
 Was great. Died after 3 years of nightly use.
 Quiet and just what we wanted!!!!
 this fan was great to the addition of my small room circulating the air evenly throughout it did the job of keeping me cool and my room fresh.
 Just what I wanted.  This fan has all my needs.  Remote timer. Ocsillating. 3 speeds.  A little taller than I thought but works great.  I would definetly recommend.
 Good quality, works very well!!
 Great high speed fan.
 EXCELLENT PURCHASE....VERY EFFECTIVE COOLING.
 Cooling and quiet, this fan does well in a desert environment! I use it in addition  to air conditioning when it's sweltering outside.
 Excelant<br/>Would revomend to everyone!!!
 Works great!
 I needed this fan to boost the AC in my house.  Placed it in the hallway to boost air flow.  Works very well and is very quiet.  The air cleaner also helps keep dust down too.
 This fan is extremely quiet. Most would appreciate this but even the highest setting has next to no white noise. We only but the fan for noise. Additionally, less than a week of use and the fan produces a loud hum. It’s louder than the white noise and was so annoying it kept me from sleeping, defeating the purpose of purchase. This was also $8 more than the exact same fan at Lowe’s (saw it today). Don’t waste your money.
 OMG this fan is amazing.  Easy to put together.  I did it myself.  It is quiet but still puts out a little bit of sound in case you are one of those who need it when sleeping.  When I saw that this product had over 7700 reviews on Amazon, I knew this was the fan for me.  Highly recommend.  Add me to the 5-star reviews
 very good!!! love it and use it all summer long!!!
 Absolutely love this fan
 Very good fan. Strong  quiet air circulation. Would buy again.
 Started hearing the motor noise within a week of usage. Not a ideal one to have especially during night time.
 Looks nice and is very quiet. Very powerful fan too.it has been a great addition to my living room so far.
 Very good quality fan. We like the Lasko brand
 Great fan, very quiet and moves air well.  Would definitely recommend it.
 This is exactly what I was looking for. Serves all the purposes and very light to move around from room to room.
 Really happy with this fan!  Going to be buying at least one more if not two.<br/><br/>Moves as much air around an average size bedroom as a ceiling fan.
 remote already stopped working one month in.
 love this but how do you clean it
 Very quiet, good fan speed, I like it.
 Quiet, nice adjusted flow of cool air. Just what I needed.
 I love this fan!!!  Cools wonderfully and is very quiet.  Want another.
 It is adequate for my uses. I have a decent sized room with a ceiling fan and it helps circulate the air.
 Just perfect for my small space.
 this is a very nice fan. it is quieter than most fans . I ordered one for my granddaughter becaused she also liked it
 it works very well, quiet and effective.
 I can't have an AC unit in my bedroom and usually my room is about 10 degrees hotter than the rest of my apt, but this fan makes my room cool within 10 minutes. Great fan!
 I like it but it is bigger than I thought.<br/>it is good to use a remote control, and it is very cool.<br/>I can adjust the angle, fan speed, and duration time of it.<br/>it very convenient to use in a small room.<br/>it is bigger than I thought, but there is not problem.
 Bought it for my sons room he loves it very quite...even has a place to keep the remote control. Thankful I got it
 This unit looks great.  It really doesn't put out much air though and can barely be felt from more than a very few feet away.  I have no idea if the ionizer works or even exists.  A blue light comes on to assure us that the unit is ionizong the air but I can't say I noticed any difference from it.  Absolutely don't run this unit without having it in oscillation mode as it then becomes an almost complete waste.<br/><br/>If I was ordering again, I'd go for a bladed fan.  This really doesn't deliver for the money spent.  Scrub that.  It doesn't deliver, it just looks good.  Pity I was swayed by the positive reviews.  They leave me baffled
 Super fan.
 Good
 Love the fan, arrived quickly, tall enough to feel the air movement while in bed.
 Good
 It worked beautifully, whisper quiet.
 This fan is very quiet.  Don't know why so many others say it is loud because it is not.  You can barely hear it.  Gives a nice breeze, too.  Highly recommend this fan.  Definitely worth the money.
 Excellent
 Very efficient and easy to operate. Low noice level and decorative.
 I love it
 prompt service with mail order.  It works great!
 Item shipped with the original Lasko box, a bit bitten up. IT is easy to put together (only need to attached the base)<br/>The fan is not very sturdy, especially feeling that when press on the control button (the whole fan will move) I use remote control most of the time instead. The fan was working fine for 2 days and start to make clicking sound. I call Lasko customer service, they told me I should contact Amazon for a replacement, the problem cannot be fix by end user. I'm returning the fan.
 it doesnt blow the air out at the right side of the fan
 Very nice  Quiet. Love it
 Good for lasso
 Great reliable fans and delivery was on time.
 Perfect.
 Box was crushed but fan seems ok.
 Nice style and works great
 I like it......what can I say about a fan?  It blows air, like it's supposed to do.  That's why I bought it. I wanted the air to move.  Thank you.
 Great fan. Quiet and cool.
 3 years later, we're still using this fan every summer! The oscillating feature is great, the controller works, and it's easy to clean - just run a duster down the front vents every couple of weeks and we're good. It has multiple settings, which are great. Very reliable and easy to use. Highly recommend this!
 Meet my expextations and no problem.
 Received within 3 days.....way faster than initially indicated.  Product is great with an excellent savings.
 Definitely quieter than other models we tried out!
 Great looking.<br/>Very quite operation.<br/>Very good air movement.<br/>Remote operation is great.<br/>Great product to have for the summer months
 Great Fan - easy to move from room to room.
 silent and descent fan
 Great product. Was delivered sooner than expected and works great!
 It's perfect! Works well.
 looks nice a powerfull.
 Auto shutoff timer works well. I am not sure if the ionizer function does anything. Would like for the fan to be more powerful in the high setting.
 Great fan...quiet...only complaint, wish it had a wider oscillating range !!!
 Quietest fan I've owned, overall low footprint. Very pleased.
 Really!  I can set the timer to shut off and also have the remote right by my bed so I can feel my way to turn it on in the middle of the night and set the timer again as well.  Also it's very quiet.  If you have night sweats and hot flashes this is the fan for you.  No kidding!!!
 It's ok. Our costco one is better.
 This is a great fan. We like it so much that we decided to buy a second one for our bedroom.
 Easy to set up, easy to use, and incredibly effective, this fan is all that I expected and more.  The low speed is all I need most of the time (it lowers the temp by at least 10 degrees), and it is whisper quiet.  The remote lets me find the perfect angle without jumping up and down to adjust it, and it also enables me to set the timer or turn it off in the middle of night without having to get out of bed. Despite some very hot weather, I've used my AC only three times this entire summer. I would definitely recommend the Lasko Wind Curve to anyone.
 Awesome and pretty cool
 Works well a good choice.
 just great, along with ceiling fan, keeps room cool
 One Word - Excellent
 Very cool and steady product would defiantly recommend
 I love this fan! It is so quiet and fits in small places but puts out great air force. I wish I would have known about these fans years ago. Thanks for the fast delivery.
 Love this fan! Quiet &amp; puts out a lot of air.
 It is good. I like the features.
 Great fan, and great customer service
 DOA, will not power on. Control buttons non-functional. Ordered a replacement. Let's hope this time I get an item that actually works.
 This fan works great! It keeps the room cool and isn't too loud.
 No complaints.  Quiet enough and moves plenty of air. I just wish they would make these things with longer electrical cords.
 Cool fan and moves a lot of air.<br/>Easy to assemble, Easy to use.<br/>Very quiet.<br/>The "Ion" light is bright.
 Works great!! Love it! Blue light for ion has to be turned off at night bc it's bright but otherwise wonderful ! Great purchase!
 Love it
 Great
 Great product, worth the price!
 One came in perfect condition, the other came broken!
 Great for small area but not a lot of power, even on high.
 Good Product! I recommoned it to others!
 After seeing so many positive reviews and also the best seller rating, I ordered this fan. I was impressed, it was running quietly. The title is little misleading as it says "Wind Curve Platinum COOLING". It does not actually pass the cool air but rather pushes the air around. Even at fan speed of 3, it is actually does not push much air. If you plan to use this fan at 80F, you might have to sit very next to it. The only good feature I can think of is the quietness of the fan, which i believe is a trade off for speed.
 Fan works as expected. Good purchase
 Terrible. The whole point of buying it was low noise --- and now after 1 year, it is VERY NOISY. Plus, there is hardly any air. So, I would not buy this again. I think in general Lasko is a cheap company.
 Great fan..love it!!!!  Keeps me cool and it's very quiet.  I recommend it to small office areas for best use.
 It's huge, clunky, doesn't have the wind power I was expecting from a fan of this size. It does not keep me cool at all.
 Works well. Very quiet.
 Nice &amp; quiet!  Love it!
 Just want we wanted, easy to carry, we take all the time to our balcony, and feel really cool, we love it
 Amazing fan
 Cool fan! :)
 I'm very pleased with this product. I purchased it prior to the summer heat and had not used it until recently. I can only say that I'm glad I got them and look forward to a cooler home. The cooling feature is great. It has a gentle force that you can feel quite a few feet away when in the low setting. The higher settings really get the job done when needed. I'd purchase again.
 Very effective and light.  Price is reasonable too.
 This fan is very quiet and puts out alot of air.  Well worth the money and I will probably purchase another.
 This fan is amazing :)
 moves a lot of air
 This Lasko curve fan saved me from summer heat. I highly recommend this for anyone who is planning to buy fan.
 I would definitely recommend this. It is a little pricey, but worth the product quality and looks. It works well, not too noisy and looks good.
 very quite compared for its size
 Excellent product and met exceed my expectation!
 Tower Fan is great, no sound!
 This is a terrific fan. It's quiet and looks pretty nice too. It also has the option for ion. I would recommend this fan to a friend.
 Makes a rattling sound every 15 seconds or so. Very irritating when trying to sleep.  Too big to repackage and return so I only not use it during Ithe day. Read other complaints about the same issue so I will start paying more attention to complaints and avoid Lasko products.
 Love the remote when in bed
 Very nice fan and very please purchase .
 It broke down after 3 months of using it. :( they wont replace the parts that is needed. Don't buy! A waste of money
 Good one
 Way too noisy at the low level.
 Powerful fan with good movement on the oscillation.  It has lasted a very long time being almost constantly on for months over the summer and hasn't let up yet. It does collect dust and hair and other particles and there is no readily apparent way to clean it without completely unscrewing the back.  Frequent vacuuming of the vents can help keep this manageable though.  That is basically the one downside.
 The fan moves air well and the remote is pretty cool.  My only issue with the unit is that it is loud.  Not fan-loud, but some other type of noise loud. The unit seems to rattle or something like that when running.  I thought the quality would be better for the price paid.
 Absolutely satisfied, saving money (do not need AC) worth to have it in the home.I am planing to have it one in each room.
 Wonderful purchase! Works like a dream!
 A bit larger than I thought.
 Nice
 Fan was received in a timely manner. Item was packed well, and instructions for assembly was great. Turned on the fan and this bad boy is noisy. Almost replicating a traffic helicopter sound hovering over the freeway during morning commute. If I didn't need it to cool down my 5 year old daughters room I would've returned it. Extremely disappointed.
 This is an amazing fan. It's very quiet and makes a small room feel very comfortable in the summer without AC. Overall I'm very happy with it.
 Gave this as a gift. They love it.
 Hard to believe it's only a fan.Works great.I wish I could make it stand up straight,it list a bit to the right(won't mind so much if it leaned to the left).
 Great
 Amazing..simple put
 Love it, especially the remote!  So far, it is quiet and efficient.  I would recomment this to anyone!  Good Luck.
 Stand is a bit flimsy but still reasonable given this price. Good air flow and like small profile. Not too noise under low speed.
 Great product, highly recommend!
 cool &amp; quiet. the best fan I have owned.  EXCELLENT
 excellent, bought three more.
 Got this tower fan a month back and find it really worth the money. Its perfect for my living room setup. Also is safe if you have kids around the house. Will definitely recommend this product.
 I have the old version of this fan and it lasted a very long time . I just got the new one a little over a month ago and its already squeeking i went on here initially to return it and i guess the window closed exactly ome month after I purchased it. Im really bummed out i have a broken fan i wish i could atleast contact the seller about this issue.
 Looking at fan's size and price, I thought it was a very strong fan but apparently its same as a usual table fan or worse. It oscillating is only up to 30 degrees. Also, the air is not reachable to all people sitting even in a small living room. You really need to sit closer to the fan to feel the air. I feel its a waste of money. The packaging and everything is good but the fan itself is not worth it.<br/>Hope I could return it for free.
 Nice one. If u want more air go to hybrid one.
 I thought this fan was mediocre at best.  I did a lot of reading before purchasing  this so I felt confident buying it.  It wasn't loud like others said, but it didn't  have much cooling power either.  Seemed cheaply made too, wouldn't recommend it at all.
 Have had it for three weeks now and completely love it! Works well and love the remote feature.  I highly recommend it!
 its great. :)
 I have a small home and this fits in a corner without any feet sticking out.
 Was great!!
 This fan is very nice. Love the compact remote. It cools my living room well. Just what I wanted. Nice.
 It was shipped within a reasonable time; was easy to assemble (10 min); it's quiet and I have no complaints so far!
 Good value, great fan
 Great great great. Best fan I ever owned. Buy this fan you will love it.
 This fan is a champ.
 Good quality item and was exactly as advertised
 it works
 I turn it on before I go to bed  and it cools the room down and then goes off automatically according to the time I set.
 BEST FAN I'VE EVER BOUGHT!!!!
 We have several and have always been pleased with the performance. None have been replaced, we just keep adding to the collection.
 Really cools the room
 Great features - works great!
 I receive this fan when it was promised.  the box was a little beat up, but the fan was ok. It took a just a little time to put it together, but so far the fan works great.
 A little bit loud..
 Just what I wanted. Great air flow, but not too much to where it's too loud or rattles.  Has a nice look.  I sleep like a baby.  3 speed. Oscillates. Great fan!
 Very nice fan.
 Performs all functions nicely. Nice slim size. Remote is handy. Moves the air in a large arc. As long as it lasts.
 Very satisfied with it!!!
 It will do the Job.
 Great purchase. Must buy.
 This fan works great.  Also it is very quiet
 The fan puts out quite a lot of cool air!  We are using it DAILY in our sunroom, which in New Orleans, gets &amp; stays warm.  This fan cools it down in no time!  Minimum noise level.  Love that we can let it oscillate or stand still.
 Everything Perfect, Glad I left @WalM
 the fan is quiet.  It has good air movement.  The remote works well.  it is well made.  I would recomend this product
 Very happy with my purchase.
 Love it.
 love it
 Awesome!
 This was a fathers day gift and he loves it.  He hasnt complained yet. Perfect height  for  laying in bed and wanting freezing cold air to hit you . I dont like being cold but my husband  has to be cold to sleep. This does the job. Id recommend this to anyone.
 Nice fan, works great.
 Love it!
 it has exceeded my expectations and it works great.  Great features. Not loud.  For me, worth the money!  Don't hesitate!
 The HIGH speed feels like LOW.  This fan looks big and sophisticated but it is a joke and I want to break it in half.  Waste of my time.<br/><br/>I have it a foot away from my bed just to feel it at all.  If I dont break it first, I will return this waste of space.
 Quiet, powerful, and clean.
 Great fan and looks great..
 Product arrived on time, and it woks great.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a fan.  Quiet, and moves plenty of air.
 failed in 5 week
 I got this for my relatively small bedroom, hoping it would be quieter and at least nearly as strong as my standup oscillating fan. Turned out that it was disappointingly weak, didn't cool the room down much at all, and even started making rattling noises that only got worse since the night after I set it up. I'm returning it and I'm not sure if I want to give any other tower fans a try or not.<br/><br/>Do not buy this product, it's cheap and overpriced.
 very nice
 Very quite, remote is a great feature, cools room down to cold most of the time. I recommend this fan.
 very good!
 I have bought this fan thinking it would be powerful. WRONG. I have a portable 5 inch fan that is more powerful.  It is really tall!  I should return it but I don't have any help. Taking it out of package was a ordeal I was lucky to find the little screws.
 Works Great!  Finally convinced Girlfriend to move it to her side so I don't have to sleep in a hurricane each night. :)  The remote is great....too bad it doesn't glow so you can find it at night.  It must come from the Tv remote family. :)
 cool..
 Great fan
 It is a great fan, both functionally and aesthetics.<br/>Easy to set up.<br/>Remote needs to be pointed towards the fan :straight at it.
 no idea how this product has such good reviews. the first two days, there was a terrible smell from it. now, the smell is gone but the fan's lack of power is surprising. the high speed is like low on any other fan i've had. complete buyers remorse. keep looking for a better fan.
 Very nice fan with very little noise
 I love my new fan!
 Mostly very happy with this fan. Quiet, remote controlled(!!), and not bad looking. However I was unpleasantly surprised to find that when it's turned on or off it emits a long loud BEEP...in case the air flow wasn't enough to let you know it was on, I guess? This can of course be jarring especially if you're making adjustments in the middle of the night...
 Great products!
 I really like this tower fan. Sleek and stylish it fits and functions well in tight spaces. Very happy with purchase.
 The weather has been hot and muggy for an extended period, and air conditioning is not an option. This fan is wonderful! It cools and cleans the air and feels as if there is air conditioning. It is quiet and energy efficient.Very happy with this fan.
 Love it!
 This is my second Lasko wind cuve tower and I like it so much that I ordered another one!!  Love it!
 I just put together the base on the fan. Yes, even a woman can do! The fan is quiet not a lot of noise like other non-tower fans that rattle... I really thought I would be getting more powerful and cooler airflow. For me, this will always have to be on setting 3 for maximum output. I was hoping to use this to help lower my air conditioning bills. Yes, I know it's a fan and not an air conditioner. I think I will definitely use in my bedroom at night and bring it out into the living room during the day. It's a high tower. Not totally dissatisfied just wish it had more power.
 Just what I expected.
 No
 Great does the job
 Very happy with this fan.
 way too loud, and the ionizer thing...? It's now just taking up room in my basement with the rest of the working but useless electronic trinkets. I should have just bought a regular fan, at that price it would be a quiet one at least
 Solid
 Handy and good price.
 Quiet
 Lasko tower fan:<br/>The Lasko tower fan model 2554 delivers what it promises. As a reviews all indicate, the fan is quiet and even at its lowest setting, still performs very well. I have the fan in my home office, (20' x 20'), and typically have it set to its lowest setting and in the oscillation mode. The fan is roughly 10 feet from me and I have absolutely no problem feeling the air coming from it at that distance.<br/><br/>The fan was easy to assemble and did come with a remote control, (though I use the term loosely). As has been noted in previous reviews, the remote control doesn't seem to be very powerful. If you're not pointing the remote control directly at the fan when you press one of the selections, your selection will not register.<br/><br/>My personal concern when purchasing a tower fan was that it would be quiet yet powerful. The Lasko tower fan has met those minimum requirements as far as I'm concerned. The remote control has 4 selections aside from its on/off selection. Which includes turning on/off the Ionizer, selecting the fan speed, selecting the timer spans, and turning on/off the oscillator.<br/><br/>I gave the fan 4 stars because the remote control did not have very good range and because the fan is not very stable and tends to wobble and move away when you try to push one of the buttons on the panel without supporting it with the other hand.<br/><br/>That's not to say that the fan is in any danger of falling over. It's just that the design should have Incorporated some kind of light-touch sensitive switches which wouldn't have to be pushed very hard causing the unit to move away from you.<br/><br/>Then I subtracted another star because I'm getting tired of receiving pre-opened boxes and re-packed items from Amazon when I'm paying for brand-new items at brand-new factory prices. Up until about a year ago, when I ordered an item from Amazon I pretty much got a brand-new item that had not been opened first and then repacked, (often very poorly), and often with some minor damage not bad enough to affect its performance but damaged, none the less.<br/><br/>I even buy pre-open boxed items when they're advertised at a discounted price but now it seems that everything I buy has been opened by someone else before I got it and still sold as a “New Item”. This has happened at least 5 times in the last 3 months and probably something like, 10 or 15 times in the last year. I buy many things from Amazon and have been for over the last 7 or 8 years. But ever since this new "wonderful" CEO manager took over, I've been having more and more problems with Amazon. The primary problem as I have said, is the opened boxes &amp; used items when I'm paying brand-new “unopened” prices.<br/><br/>The Lasko tower fan I received is very easy to assemble yet, whoever had it before I got it apparently didn't know what end of the screwdriver to use and somehow screwed up putting the thing together, (we're talking about 4 screws)! This is not very surprising as many people are not very good with even the simplest of mechanical assemblies. They may not own a screwdriver or know where they put it if they did, and would use a butter knife or a coin in their pocket.<br/><br/>That's all fine but it appears that their butter knife slipped, (if they use a butter knife at all), and they somehow bent the plastic counter bored surface, (don't ask me how). The damage didn't affect the performance of the fan or its assembly and is unseen after the assembly is completed anyway. However, that’s not the point. It was sold as a brand new item and I was charged on that pretense. That has been the condition of the Amazon items that I’ve been getting lately.<br/><br/>I paid full price for a brand-new item and if there had been a discounted offer for the same fan as an "open box" item, I probably would've bought it. However, there wasn't at the time and I took a star off the Lasko tower fan because I based the review as if it were a brand-new "straight from the factory" item. Therefore, the damage around the counter bores is a reflection of the quality of a so-called, "brand-new fan".<br/><br/>I wouldn’t consider this fan very fancy and I think it should've probably been painted black or white to give it a better appearance. However, I do recommend the fan if you’re looking for something that's quiet and yet able to perform well even under low settings.<br/>Rich
 It serves the purpose for which I bought it.
 Great for small to medium rooms. It circulates the air very well, It would work well for a patio as well.
 It works great!
 excellent
 Great product
 Fans works great and easy to assemble.
 Good thing!
 I bought this fan for our master bedroom and the Honeywell Quiet Set tower fan for my daughter's bedroom. This fan is "ok". It's taller than the Honeywell. Moves air and gets the job done. Only 3 fan speeds compared to 5 speeds of the other fan. It does not appear to be as sturdy as the other fan. It looks and handles cheaper, as compared to the other. Overall I prefer the Honeywell fan over this fan.
 Great, very quiet.
 Despite what other people said, it is not noisy on high.  They must have extra sensory hearing.  It gives great cool even on the low setting which is what I mostly use when sleeping.  AAA+++++
 Works great.
 Was looking for a fan that people thought was quiet. Based on what was stated in the reviews I purchased this fan. I received the fan quickly and turned it on. On the 2 lowest settings the fan had a rattling sound. On the high setting the noise went away. I returned the fan and received a replacement a few days later. This fan had a load humming sound when the oscillation was turned on. Based on the ratings I expected the fan to be quiet. I will not try a third time with this fan.
 Love the look and works good. It is stinky but I have only used it one night. My remote does not work, checked the batteries were in correctly and they are fresh.
 Very good
 I have never given an Amazon product a bad review. This fan is AWFUL. The base of it falls apart if you look at it and the fan itself is really, really heavy. It puts out a good amount of air if you can stabilize it. It falls over. A LOT. If you are looking to supplement your AC. Look elsewhere!
 I love this lasko fan. it's not loud compared to the one that we bought in Walmart before I order this online.
 Good product...
 this is a very good fan.  However, the ionizing feature does not seem that effective.
 Like it.  Powerful air stream and yet very quiet.
 This fan is quite and powerful. But, it doesn't rotate as much as I would like it to and that is why only 4 stars. If you want a quite fan, this is a good pick.
 It is nice to have a quiet fan going while sleeping.<br/>The oscillating feature makes the fan more effective.<br/>The remote is especially handy
 Very good
 Great, just as described!
 For all of the high humming noise it makes it should push out more air. But the high humming noise is something that drives me nuts. Maybe this one was just defective as I did try one at the local store that was not so loud so?!?!?
 works great
 This is a nice stylish fan that puts out a lot of air for its size. It is quiet and the included remote is great. Fast shipping!
 Love it!
 We use this fan every night to provide ambient noise.  It's wonderful, works like a charm!  The ionic air purifier is awesome.  After turning that function on, I could immediately tell the difference in the air quality.  Would recommend!
 Does the job
 Excellent oscillating fan.  Meet all of my desires.
 nice looking
 Good fan. No noise
 Pros -- oscillates, quiet, powerful.<br/>Neutral - It's big (although not as big as a traditional standing fan). About 42" tall and a footprint of about one square foot (approximate). Only 3 speeds.<br/>Cons -- Timer button on fan arrived damaged and non-functional. This seems to be a recurring issue (at least, other reviews mention the same issue). It's big, and it comes with a remote, so not worth returning or pursuing but a little annoying (hence the 3 stars).
 Great fan. Highly recommend.
 It is a good product for reasonable price.
 Excellent Fan, only if the price was lower
 I've had this fan for 3  days and since day 1 of use, it's smells of burning plastic which in turn fills the room with this horrible smell!! The fan is in working order thou, no rattling noises, etc.  But because of this smell we can't use this fan.
 This fan works great. My wife got it for her classroom and the kids even ask her to turn it on they like it so much. It moves a fantastic amount of air and is quiet enough not to disturb the classroom during teaching.
 The fan looks nice and it works well, but it doesn't blow as hard as I thought it would. I would still recommend it though. It looks nice and is easy to move it around.
 Very efficient and quite fan
 Excellent product- exactly as I ordered.
 Exactly what I wanted and needed!
 I have other Lasko fans and have been happy with them but this fan is horrible.  The first one I received makes a loud clicking noise even at low speed.  It sounds like a bad bearing or like something is stuck in the fan.  The replacement I received made the same noise only slightly at first but after about ten minutes was nearly as bad.  The noise is loud enough that even on the lowest setting I can hear it over my TV.  I am now returning both of them for a refund, don't waste your time with these pieces of junk.
 Do not buy this it will make you sick. I had it originally in my kids’ bedroom. Kids were constantly sick after the Ionizer was on for the whole night. I moved it to our bedroom. I woke up with the headache and throat pain the next day. My wife is sick to. Just to make sure it’s the Ionizer that making us sick, I turned it on last night again. I got sick again. I don’t know if this Ionizer is releasing ozone that make us all sick. Be aware.
 Great fan for now
 Simply love it
 This fan was fine for about 20 days. It began rattling like crazy and then today it literally just shut off and won’t turn back on. I’m super frustrated. I don’t have the box anymore, but I’m going to contact amazon for a refund. Not idea when it’s a hot day and this is your only means for a fresh breeze.
 this was a life saver for my little boys room since i can't put easily and aircondition inside the window that did the job<br/>it dose not make the room very cooled  but it dose make the airey and fresh air
 I knew this fan was too good to be true. Looked great, easy assemble. It would cool the room soo well, almost too cold. Just how I like it.<br/>Unfortunately like the others have stated, over time it started to make a hum then the hum turned into a tick and now it sounds like a chopping block or like its gurgling. Now it cools no more than my ceiling fan. It’s sounds like it’s struggling &amp; more &amp; more sluggish every time I turn it on. I was really trying to give it a chance. Now realizing it’s worse than I thought &amp; I’m past my return window...to the trash it goes. Would NOT recommend, sad to say
 Noisy. We have had reliability problems. Had a grinding noise when the unit was on rotate, but that went away. Feels like this moves much less air than the one of similar design that it replaced.
 great！very quiet
 This fan looks very nice, but I was disappointed with the air flow.  Even at the highest speed it doesn't blow very hard and there is no way this could cool a larger room.  A small portable fan in our room does a much better job.
 Good item
 Is very good
 Today I got this fan in the mail, I got it because all of the high star ratings. The box was not damaged in any sort of way and when I opened it and set it up, the buttons to operate the fan on top were smashed in and none of them work whatsoever.. I'm very disappointed about this product.
 Looks nice, works well.
 I bought this fan because it was the #1 bestseller on Amazon for tower fans and the few reviews I browsed supported that ranking.  The fan works as expected and makes a reasonably low humming noise.  It is large, so it reaches a wide area, but unfortunately, the large size of the fan coupled with the fake wood paneling makes it an eye-sore.  The product picture does not do this beast's hideousness justice - you have to see it to believe it.  If it were all grey, I would probably give it 5 stars, so if looks don't matter, go for it.
 Works fantastically. Very quiet. The rotating feature works well and takes up very little room. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.
 One of the most quietest fans I've ever used. Is much taller than the standard tower fan. High setting could put out a little more air but it would probably sacrifice the quietness. Great buy
 Very good.
 its the best,
 Have had the fan for quite a while and still works. Wish it had a remote but thermostat is a nice feature. The thermostat decreases the fan power as you get closer to temperature you set it at. So fr so good
 Love it
 very good
 Great fan!
 This fan does everything you could possibly want a fan to do, including a remote. For $63 it is a fabulous bargain!
 I've had an older Lasko fan for about 15 years, and it as served me well (see attached picture on left for comparison).  It started to become a little flaky in that it appeared the power would cut in and out but not completely die.  (After I ordered the new fan, I fixed the problem with the old one.  I think the fan had a tilt sensor to shut it off if knocked over, and leveling the fan made the problem disappear.)<br/><br/>While the fan blowing surface appears to be about the same, the new fan is a little taller.  But the new design is much better looking.  My initial observations are that the new fan is quieter, but not as strong, even on the highest setting.  Still, at about 10 feet away, I can feel the fan on all three speeds.  And on the lowest setting, the fan is extremely quiet.<br/><br/>The swing area is about 90 degrees, which was the same as the old fan.<br/><br/>The old fan made a beep when the remote signal was sensed, letting you know that the message was received.  The new fan is completely silent upon receiving a remote command (pivot, timer, ion, and fans speed).  This is probably better, but will take some getting used to.<br/><br/>Note that the new remote is exactly the same, and can still control the new fan, so don't throw away the remote if you want to have two or a backup.<br/><br/>I would give it 5 stars, but, first, I subtract one star for the fact that the new fan has what I can only describe as a very fast clicking sound, even when ion is off and the fan is not oscillating.  Right now I’m very tuned into the new noise, but I assume I’ll get used to it and it will become less annoying.  Still, my old fan didn’t have it, so I know the fan can be built without it.<br/><br/>Second, I subtract 1 star because the fan does not remember your settings like the old fan.  Every time you power on, you have to change your settings to how you like them.  Boo!<br/><br/>Nothing worse is a deal breaker, and it is better looking, so overall this fan gets 3 stars.
 For the amount I paid, it was worth every penny.  I do like the many features it brings.  It has three speeds as, I believe, all fans have.  But what surprised me was that at the first speed it gave off so much breeze.  I keep it at one and in the swing mode.  Up to now, I have not tried it for night use where it can be set to go off in a half an hour, or 1, 2 or 4 hours.  It is a great fan--tall and slim so it does not take up a lot of space.
 We have bought these fans (4 to be exact) before and they are very quiet and efficient.  This last purchase is an absolute disappointment.  The fan is very noisy and very distracting.  Not happy at all with the latest fan.
 I just bought my third one of these and it's terrible now. When I turned it on, the nice white noise the older model makes was gone. Now it's got this terrible electronic whine that ruins the nice noise. I returned the first one and got another, but had the same problem. I’m definitely returning this one and getting a completely different fan.
 I truly don't understand all the positive reviews. I get more power from a $20 fan I bought at Walgreens 7 years ago on the lowest setting than I do from this on the highest setting. I even went so far as to put it right at the end of the bed and still it does not provide enough air. I wanted to like it, but unfortunately it is going back.
 The good: It moves alot of air, and has a nice look to it. The controls are easy too. The bad: it has an obnoxiously loud hum that you can hear clear on the other side of the room. I'm glad I didn't buy this for while sleeping. Also it's really wobbely. It sways a good 2 inches in every direction when just pushing the buttons. The base is secure, it's the joint in which it oscilates that has all the play.
 Great fan. . . have used it every day since it arrived.  Didn't realize it has a small remote. . . can turn it off/on, swivel, fan speed and ionizer.  Very happy with my purchase.
 I had a fan similar to this one that I had for 5 yrs. I wore it out. I trust that this one will last just as long. Haven't found any problems with it yet. It's a good fan to use when you don't won't to run your air conditioner. The price could have been a few dollars cheaper. Love, Love the way it keeps the air fresh.
 The Fan worked fine for a month then stopped working.  It was quiet and pushed a fair amount of wind.  Returning for a different Brand.<br/><br/>I bought the fan exactly 2 months ago but looks like I need to deal directly with the fan manufacturer to get the issue resolved.  Thanks very little Amazon :(<br/><br/>"After the applicable return period has expired, your item might still be eligible for exchange or repair under the manufacturer's warranty.

 It's OK, but for the price I should have purchased the Honeywell, which Consumer Report recommends.
 After we fixed it all up the oscillation option does not work seems like we got a damaged piece, and it was too late to return it as we did not keep the box and we went out of town for 3 weeks, basically lost time. Otherwise it it a great fan, I keep it on all day during summer so it keeps the room cool for my dog too.
 I bought it for my husband's billiard room and take it from there when he's not using it and use it in my craft room. I've even swiped it and put it in the bedroom. it's awesome cause it's quiet, works just perfect for air flow, has a GREAT timer so if you're warm when you go to bed, set it to turn off after minutes or hours..it is awesome. The BEST fan I've ever owned.
 i bought it almost an year ago and its no longer working, it does not power on at all... i thought lasko products are good.. i saw it in my friends house then bought it thinking that it would last for few years... but i was wrong.. it had warranty of 1 year only, now i am about 1 month over 1 year.. will not buy lasko again.... :( :( :(
 This fan hasn't been turned off in the 1.5+ years after I bought it, it sits in a room just chugging along. Lasko makes amazing products and this is no exception.
 Unable to assemble, because there were NO screws included in the package. Not very happy. Now I have to figure out where to find the correct size screws.
 It is a decent fan for the price. Could have been slightly cheaper as i don't think the fans are made of high quality plastic etc. But definitely serves the purpose for the price
 This fan arrived in a timely manner and I was super excited to try it out. I turned it on, and it worked great! Two days later, the oscillation function stopped working! I had been really busy, so when I finally got around to trying to return it, the time period for returns had expired! So now I am stuck with a fan that doesn't oscillate. Other than that, it works fine.
 Recently purchased 42 in Lasko Tower Fan from Amazon.com.  Really pleased with the product and the service provided by Amazon.  This fan has exceeded my expectaions and I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Lasko-2551-Wind-Curve-Platinum-Tower-Fan-With-Remote-Control-and-Fresh-Air-Ionizer/dp/B000RL3UJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Lasko 2551 Wind Curve Platinum Tower Fan With Remote Control and Fresh Air Ionizer</a>
 Even though I read all the negative feedback on this product I had to see for myself and I have to say all the negative feedbacks are true. This fan blows like a $10 fan with very little air. It's suitable for one person standing in front of it. I'm very disappointed with this fan.
 I would have given it 0 stars. The fan blows so softly, it does nothing to cool. So disappointed!
 Air flow is not very forceful , the noise level is fairly high for such low air flow and the unit makes a fairly loud click when it oscillates.
 Good fan, but not even a year in and the oscillation motor alternates between squeaking loudly and not working at all.
 If I could give it 0 stars I would. I live in 100 degree weather with no AC and windows that hinge open like doors so they don't support window AC units. Be reviews seemed great for this and I thought "fresh air ionizer" meant fresh cool air. Nope: literally blew hot air at me, and BARELY. There were 3 settings of power and the highest was weaker than my $15 dollar fan from wal mart. Had it for a day. Can't stand the heat. Left me feeling hotter than before.
 Works wonderfully in our living room. The high speed is a little noisy but overall love the design and function of this fan.
 Great fan. Pretty quiet for the amount of air it moves. I did think it would move a bit more air at its highest setting but still does a great job.
 Really disappointed. Purchased due to all the great reviews and it being top-rated fan. Barely blows air and warm air at that! Not sure how others are saying it blows cold air like air conditioning. I ordered two. Opened one to test it--will keep it because I don't want to take apart and ship, but returned the other.
 I had no problem with the fan and I use it fo rmy baby's room on low.  It circulates very nicely.
 I don't live in the middle of an asphalt jungle in a 120 F desert, but this fan works delightfully in a two-bedroom apartment in California (no AC). We use it for whichever room we are in, and this strategy works. The noise is very low.
 Love the color combination and good fresh air circulation.
 The fan is great but the base does not fit. I couldn't get the fan to stay on the base. I have to lean it against a wall. Poor base construction.
 The breeze is good and the remote works well.  But the thing is very shaky in its base, not sturdy at all.  Needs heavier base.
 I bought this fan for my husband to cool his stuffy basement office.  Works great and he loves the remote control feature.
 great product. Doing exactly what it was designed to do. Cool. Bought 6 of these
 Very disappointed with this fan.  The high selection does not blow as high as the low setting on my Seville Classic.  I need a FAN not a whisper.
 This fan only operated for 2 months before it started smoking and smelling like burning electrical wires.  A very disappointing purchase.
 Had it less than 2 months, and it is now dead. It was not a cheap fan, however the quality is subpar. I will contact lasko next week. Buyers beware.
 Not strong enough of a wind....
 It is not as powerful as I thought it would be but it does have a remote control and and ionizer so for the price it is good.
 This fan is extremely noisy.  Not satisfied at all.  We got this fan so we could have some white noise and air circulation, this was rated to be one of the quieter fans.  Nope.  Sounds like its trying to take off, loud rumbly sound.  Would not recommend this, especially if you are using it to help you sleep at night.
 Wonderful
 So far I literally opened the package and plugged it in and it won't even turn on. I will buy some batteries tomorrow to see if it will turn on via remote  but if not this thing is a piece of garbage.<br/><br/>Edit: It turns on via remote and does work well. It's just a bit frustrating knowing that the buttons on the actual device itself are no good.
 I will give this fan this, it is quiet. But the air velocity coming out is weak, even at the highest setting. Plus it doesn't have much of a oscillating range. Not sure why they make remotes for fans now. Not something I would ever use. We'll see how long it lasts.
 have received this fan, and yes I like it, but I wanted you to know I ordered a new one, and it was all taped up, and the cord was black and the plug is navy blue is sure looks used to me,<br/><br/>I am not saying I am not happy with it,  I just didn't want to pay new price for something that is used
 This is among the worst products I've ever purchased from Amazon.com. It worked for several weeks until the fan function stopped working. Emails to Lasko went unanswered, phone calls resulted in no support.<br/><br/>I'd suggest you look elsewhere. Avoid Lasko products... You'll be disappointed.
 This fan has worked well so far and compliments the beautiful wooden furniture in my office.  I haven't ward any noises yet (as suggested by previous reviews).
 This fan began having problems within 24 hours of its arrival. The fan motor was extremely loud...loud enough that you could not have a conversation in the same room. The Ionizer smelled like burning rubber or the beginning of an electrical fire. The oscillating function even had problems. Do not purchase this product.
 Not much air volume and the base isn't very sturdy for the size of the fan body, but it looks cool/good.
 I enjoy this quiet efficient  tower fan.It takes up little space and looks good also. I am pleased with how it works. Amazon is great to work with.  The product was  packaged well and I received quick delivery.  I have been very pleased with everything I purchased at Amazon.
 This fan is quiet and moves air very well. We had another one of the same model and liked it so much that we bought this one, too. Be aware that some fans (like our other version of this model) make a burning smell at first. With our fan that went away after a few days, though it was quite strong and unpleasant for a while. Great fan!
 Ordered this fan a few weeks ago and at first it was great. Then after about a week it began to make a loud motor-like sound while running, and now I can't concentrate on anything or fall asleep while it's on.<br/><br/>Oh, and the base is not sturdy at all- with just a brush the fan runs the risk of falling over.
 The fan would be great if it didn't make such a  horrible noise when it ooscillates.
 Lousy fan - very large in size, but fan speed, even at maximum, is pretty weak.....  Sorry that I bought it.
 I ordered two of these fans. These got us through a major early heat wave. 100 degrees F and no central air. These fans immediately made our living room comfortable, and actually made our bedroom cold! Minimal noise, added convenience of the remote controls, not too big, easy to move from room to room if needed. Would definitely buy again.
 Does not work that well. It is a fan that blows air but do not expect more than that.
 super easy fan to have it handy and help with the AC to circulate the air in the rooms.
 A tower fan that I actually tall enough !!<br/>Works great and has remote.
 No issue here... I like... not sure about that ION feature and how good it is.
 Its strongest mode isnt that strong compared to other fans but i do not mind it because the fan is quieter and blows colder air than other fans I have had.
 This fan is very over priced and does not blow air that hard at all.  I ended up returning it.
 Love the sleek look of this fan!
 HI fan is great and quiet.  It would have been 5 stars if they include the batteries for the remote control.
 Fan offers limited air.  Took hours to assemble the stand due to wrong size screws sent in package.  Fan stand is wobbly regardless of low many times we took it apart and reassembled it.  Very poor quality, Id be surprised if it lasts through the summer.  Would have returned it except for the hassle involved with returning Amazon products.
 Lasko Wind Curve Fan runs and noisy from electronic control board. Please send to me a return code label.
 Ask your friend to blow your way.  Cheaper way to get the same level of cooling.
 Not worth the money. The base is cheap - fan wobbles and is NOT strong, no matter how high you turn the power up. Sorry I bought this.
 Looks good, but compared to the Tower fan I bought from Costco, just does not have enough force in the air.
 great product. Doing exactly what it was designed to do. Cool
 Not as quiet as I hoped and doesn't have a very low, low setting
 The fan’s engine makes a loud and terrible whirring sound. I love using fans as white noise but this was impossible to ignore.
 I have been using this fan for the last 1 month and so far the fan works perfectly. The remote is handy and has good functionality.  Priced on Amazon similar to Walmart but without taxes.  So the only thing you save through Amazon is taxes.
 Love it.
 worst fan i have ever used. it is not strong and it stopped working after a month. not worth the price
 No complains, it does what it is supposed to do. Not noisy or bulky
 Very Happy with this purchase.  Easy to assemble and easy to use. Highly recommend this product!
 I'll start by saying it is a good looking fan. However the wind output is really lacking on the max setting. It's also rather loud. For the money I'm sure there is a better option.
 like it
 Looked like a nice fan, but way too large
 Its okay but invest in a portable AC unit instead
 This fan definitely has less or no noise compared to the traditional fans. Its sleek and takes less place. Has a timer and comes with 3 speeds. The air throw may not be as good as the traditional fan and also the height may be a disadvantage.
 First bought this fan as a gift for a relative in early 2011.  She was very satisfied.  Then decided to buy one for myself.  Found the fan at Amazon.com at a better price than the first. Received it in good condition and was very satisfied with the performance.  Bought a third one for another room.  Making good use with these fans.  Like the three different speed settings and the fixed or oscillating mode.  The air is very cool but not strong against you.  I would strongly drecommend this for anyone.
 Great fan, not to noisy and definitely produces a good gust of cold air. Great size as well!
 This fan  makes a very noticeable "hum" whenever it's running. It is annoying to the extent that I will either donate it or throw it away. It was advertised as noiseless.
 Relatively quiet for a fan. It's quite cooling even for the lowest fan speed.
 The wind curve is a good fan and really circulates the air throughout the room but it is noisy for sleeping.
 Wish it was a little louder.  Very quiet if that's what you want.
 Too big. Not enough power for size.
 Nice looking fan but but very weak blowing action. You need to be within 6 feet to feel the effects. I am very disappointed.
 Excellent product.  Highly recommend.
 fan is quiet and moves air very well.
 The fan cools well, but it makes a terrible rattling noise. It is really an irritant when you are trying to fall asleep at night - even my kid complains about the noise.
 Afer i brought this fan it only work for two months , i had put it in my store room and after two wich is today 26-3-2013 i decided to checked it out , in the fan has a black box and in that box has wires and a elecktric board with a small fuse , that fuse has blown, so notify the Lasko company that they have to install a bigger amps fuse, i sure that alot of client had that problem
 Large fan, solid construction.
 Not giving one star for what it does. Works great but after one summer it stopped working out of the blue. That's garbage.
 Just in time for the next heat wave - love it!
 Decent fan. Needs to be quite near you thought to get adequate airflow. My biggest complaint is the remote...IT SUCKS! I have to press each button 3-5 times for the fam to register my input... For an almost $100 fan, it's built very cheaply.
 Great fan. I live in a 1bd 650sqft apartment, and this fan helps keep the space very cool. I would recommend this product.
 I was expecting cold air to cool my living room. What I have is slightly cool air that modestly helps relief from the heat. A Vornado fan sitting in my bedroom circulates the air with a stronger output which cools the room quicker and  better.
 Overall, a great product.  It is a lot quieter than our old one we had which was the selling point for us.
 BLOWS REALLY COOL AIR, GETS THE JOB DOWN. EVEN ON THE HOT DAYS, IT KEEPS ME NICE A COOL, GREAT BUY.
 Awful smell when in use.
 I've had this fan for about 2 months and at first it was great. Now there is a permanent rattling and it does not stop. I sleep with a fan on and completely feel like I've wasted my money because I can't sleep with the rattling. It's not like the natural noise of the fan- it's an odd rattling noise that obviously doesn't belong.
 Works well....so far.
 After owning this fan for a few years it has become incredibly noisy. Level 3 feels like level 1 on other fans.
 So far the fan is working super awesome. It's powerful and keeps the temperature down. The only drawback is the very loud and unnecessary beep when you turn off the fan.
 GREAT Fan !  we Love It !
 I bought this fan (twice) to replace an 8 year old tower fan that I use while sleeping. On the second night this fan started making a loud clicking and rattling sound. Amazon quickly replaced, but the second fan only lasted for 4 days before it started making similar sounds.
 EXCELLENT
 Rather disappointed with this fan. Looks nice but even on its lowest setting it is much louder than I expected. Also, with fresh batteries the remote seems to have a range of about 10 feet. This might not be an issue for everyone but is disappointing. I would not recommend this fan to others.
 One of the blades inside the fan was broken.
 fan speed is too low
 I've had this fan for 6 months and love it.  It is quiet with lots of settings.  Very convenient with the remote control.  Looks good in my living room or anywhere I put it.
 So happy I bought this.
 Would buy again in a heartbeat.
 Fan performs great and can cool a whole room.  The remote control doesn't work though.... But I can't give 5 stars with the remote control problem.
 It does NOT cool! I liked it a lot as a normal fan with natural temperature air. I give it 3 stars because it is unfair that you cannot buy more than one per account, Lasko should fix that.
 Hot summer nights
 Does NOT put out much air..
 Very good fan.
 Works great .
 Fan works, but it is way too loud. There is a loud, constant humming that is prevalent in every speed. Tried, but couldn't sleep with it on in the same room.
 I am a fan of this fan!
 As a gift I purchased this after reading the reviews I made my decision so under the other reviews and previous purchase I think this s a great tower fan personally haven't tried ths one but sure ths s as good as all reviews
 All good
 Good product
 Get an ac if you want cool air
 Awesome fan
 Love it.
 This fan is a great deal. It is quiet - moves a lot of air - and is affordable. The fan's height is perfect so that it does not need to be propped or adjusted.
 Quiet for a tower fan<br/>Love the timer on it
 Love this fan!
 I previously had the same product for 6 years...it worked perfectly! VERY HAPPY!<br/>Highly recommended product, Priced very reasonable !
 A bit noisy but works well.
 My fan did not come with the appropriate amount of screws therefore it is off axis and constantly falls.  i can not find the seller feedback or comment section so hopefully someone replies to this product review.
 Very impressed with the performance, very quiet.  Love the remote!
 This came without any screws to connect it to the base. Everything else seems to work fine, but now it's obviously unsecured. I don't want to return the entire thing and have to order a new one. If they could just send me the screws...
 It a little louder than my other brand, Seville classic.  This one sits a little higher than others so if you want a higher spray of air this is a good one.  But the Seville classic has a taller area that blows air outward
 The scrolls that came with products did fits in the holes. Am so disappointed I need my money back or send the right scrolls.
 Good product. Cheaper than Walmart. does the job just fine. it's making me put more words in here, not sure what else i can say about this product.
 Nice unit, quiet, just wish rotated a little further...Only complaint, box had been opened and resealed poorly.  Made me wonder if was returned...Will be interesting to see if Amazon responds to that**
 Nice fan all around.
 The fan arrived quickly and in good condition, worked great right out of the box and is used for at least a couple of hours every day.  It looks good and works better, quiet and efficient.  Would definitely reccomend to a friend.
 just not enough velocity
 I live in Louisiana and we have had several 109+ degree days lately. I had hoped this fan would supplement some air flow in our living room. Unfortunately, this fan is completely useless outside a range of 3 feet. With the fan on the highest setting, you cannot feel the slightest amount of airflow beyond about 3 feet away. To further elaborate, you can comfortably sleep with this fan blowing less than 12 inches from your face because of the lack of power. The fan is almost completely silent. I will give it that. I just assume that it is because it really isn't doing anything.
 I guess my idea of a fan is different than most. I would put the output of this fan on par with fanning yourself with a copy of TV Guide.
 Didn't create much air flow to begin with... and then it stopped working altogether about 6 months after purchase. It looks nice, but that's about it.
 too loud and it sounds like it might break down any minute.
 For its size and price I expected better! It does not move air or cool my small classroom at all. Thinking I will return and look for something better/more efficient.
 Way too noisy! Do yourself a favor and research the noise levels of these so-called quiet fans. This one is noisier on the lowest setting than some others are on high. It’s going back.
 Had it sent to my daughter in NYC, making her the most popular person in her apartment.  :)  It arrived a day earlier than we expected, giving her an extra day of coolness.
 OMG I hope this company makes things right. Shipped in the manufacturers box. No protection. Top ripped off and the rest squashed. How could they ship it this way? This wasn't a cheap tower fan.<br/>I would ship it back but pretty much totalled. Furious.
 great!
 Noisy buzz. Lasco sticker crooked. Returning. Made in China. One star
 Dang blue light shines brighter than the north star! Keeps me cool though.
 The fan works well and I like how quiet it is.  However the remote stopped working after sometime, and it is not a battery issue.
 Had seen this model in a office and am very satisfied with ours, Remote or timer and fresh air ionizer what more could you want
 Oscillation feature broke within 2 weeks of receiving this, but we got rid of the box (not expecting it to break), so it was too much of a hassle to find something to ship it back in.
 I moves air nicely, but this it has a weird ticking in the motor. Since I have this on all night while I sleep, it's slightly problematic. It's not enough that I can't sleep, but I don't think I would buy this model again.
 Burning  smell from the first day to few weeks.<br/>I returned it 3 weeks ago. I still not get back the returned money.
 Love this fan. The remote works with my older lower series Lasko that did not come with a remote also, which makes it a win win for me.
 Good size fan for the price, however i think it needs more power to really be a good buy. I'm keeping this one because it's a pain to return, but i will be more careful next time.
 Just received fan and works as advertised. Easy to setup and quiet. Don't know how effective the ion feature is in a large room but will find out (dust allergy).
 It doesn’t work. Plugged it in and the lights turned on but nothing worked. It would turn, but no fan or wind being pushed out.
 My wife wanted a quiet, cool fan, reasonably priced.  And the Lasko fan, which sits in our family room, does the job, very quietly!  She's happy, I'm happy.
 A bit louder than I wanted it to be but still a pretty good fan.
 The product no longer works and I only had it two months and the return period is over. How do I get a refund for this.
 Best fan I've ever owned. Love that it comes with a remote, is programmable, and puts out a ton of air without getting too loud. Would definitely recommend to others.
 I was disappointed on how loud this fan is. Ordered it for the bedroom and it is not quiet. Puts out a lot of air, so for other rooms during the day it's great.
 very quite and save room
 Great tower fan! Arrived quickly and unharmed. It's been quite warm here and we use it almost daily. Would be lost without it.
 Good fan but no screws were in the box so had to go to local hardware store with the manuel.
 I've only had this fan 6 to 8 mos. It was great at first very impressed. safe for little ones running around the house. then the fan died all of a sudden. Not worth the money if yu ask me.
 Works as advertised. Not too sure about the ionisation. But I'm happy and my girlfriend is happy (happy girlfriend, happy life).
 Cold air and what I like about it is<br/><br/>The time for how long you want it to last on<br/><br/>30min an 1hr up to 3hrs
 Outstanding fan!  Rotation cycle is perfect, and this fan really puts out a lot of air circulation. Great buy
 in one word!  Very happy with this product!
 Th fan is very good. However  the box was delivered broken at the bottom. I was not happy!
 LOVE THIS  AIR DOESNT RUN AS MUCH, MAKES DEN COOL
 works great
 Good product.  Quiet.  Throws out a lot of air.  This fan alone is sufficient to keep my bedroom cool enough to have a good nights sleep.
 Sleek model easy to place in any room. I love the remote a plus is the ability to set fan to turn off cool feature.
 Simply isn't as powerful as I imagined.
 I was so pissed when I got it. The box it came in was ripped apart and when I took out the fan it was broken both inside and out. Things kept falling out of it.
 This fan is perfect for bedrooms--very quiet but still powerful enough to keep things cool. Definitely recommended as a stand-up option.
 Poor quality junk - the oscillating motor failed after ~2 months of use, while my far cheaper (and older) Honeywell fan continues to work fine, despite spending most of its life outside.
 So far I liked it.  No complaints except the fan speed is not much.  It does what is supposed to do.
 MADE IN CHINA AND YOU CAN TELL RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT IT IS JUNK. DO NOT BUY TGIS PRODUCT. I WAS HESITANT AFTER READING REVIEWS AND I STILL DID AND REGRET IT 100 PERCENT.
 This fan sucks.  When it's on high it feels like low.
 So far so good...gave had it for close to a month.
 It's everything I wanted. I have had two of these tower fans and they have been great and I would buy another in a heart beat. Very happy!
 This is the first tower fan I've ever purchased. I'm pleased with the way it cools the master bedroom, but I'm quite disappointed in how much noise it makes. The Low speed is tolerable, but Medium and High are much too noisy. I tried setting it on a large heavy book, rather than on the carpet, to see whether that made a difference, and it did not. I need to buy one or two more for my house, so I'll try a different brand. I bought this one based on its great Amazon customer reviews, but there must be a quieter one out there.
 I was very disappointed with this item. Set up was easy but it smelt like burning plastic. I initially thought there may be plastic around a filter but all internal parts are closed up &amp; I couldn't see anything that would indicate the source of the smell. I returned this product.
 I purchase de THIS product 4 Months 5 Days ago it has stopped Working.  I've not used it enough for it to be faulty especially since I was away for 3 1/2 months
 Very loud and the fan is very weak, even on high.  Not worth the money
 Love this fan.
 PERCHASED A YEAR AGO, BUT HAVE NOT USED VERY MUCH.  NOT SURE OF LONGTERM ENDURANCE.  NO COMPLAINTS YET.  COST EFFECTIVE.
 Sorry it is a nice looking unit and has 3 speeds, but even the highest speed is not that powerful !!!!
 Very silent but not powerful enough
 Works great!
 Fairly noisy compared to Bionaire. Doesn't swerve as much. And no room to place the attached remote, making is easy to misplace.
 Really good fan and not that loud
 This is a nice quiet fan that does its job. We have had Lasko fans before and have been pleased with their quality.
 Love this fan! I am tempted to buy another.
 Only had for 3 weeks but so far no problems, .quite,good air distribution,and I need 7 more words so  I can submit
 Great
 This fan only lasted 6 weeks and completely stopped working.
 After 5 months fan just stops working, I had cheaper fans last me longer than this one did . I would not recommend this fan.
 Works great, quiet, nice features.
 Puts out so much cool air! Much better than the standard rotating fan. It is quiet as well. Very happy with the 2 I bought.  Might get more!
 after 2 months....the auto turning stopped working. everytime i push osc or ionizer, the whole thing powers off.
 The fan works great, but the remote control is very spotty.  About half of the time it doesn't work at all.  Luckily, the remote control was not really one of the features I needed, however, if that was something I really needed, I would be horribly disappointed.
 Firstly, the fan was delivered 2 days late and then it has the controls broken and doesn't function at all.
 Lasko makes a MUCH more powerful fan that costs less.  Look up Lasko #4930 High Velocity Fan.  It's infinitely better.
 Have had it a month and it stopped oscillating.  Super frustrated and unable to return it.
 When mounting the base to the fan, I realized that the screws had not been included.  Rather than wait to phone the "Help" number and then wait a week or more for screws to be mailed, I consulted the manual.  Two screws were supposedly self-threading #8 x 1/2" which I happen to have in my shop -- uh-uh: turns out that #8 would have split the base open but #6 worked.  The other four screws were stated to be M5 x 1/2" machine screws which I didn't have but now do after a special trip to two different hardware stores -- uh-uh: turns out that the required screws are #10 x 1/2" machine screws.  Wasted trip to hardware stores but I now own four small metric machine screws and have a working fan within two hours of delivery.  On to the remote -- supplied with two lovely "Sony" AA batteries -- uh-uh: remote actually is intended to take AAA batteries.  This was sort of a comical irritation for me but, for the sake of customers who may not be blessed with an understanding of mechanical parts, someone (Amazon?) shoud talk to the "Lasko" people about rewriting their manual in accordance with the product they provide.
 It works great but somehow the cold air doesn't keep it cool in the house, that's the only downside. Overall its okay.
 Easy assembly. Powerful fan. Perfect for cooling my studio apartment.
 Good product!
 Nice and quiet.
 Not very happy with this product
 PIECE OF DUMP GARBAGE.  DIED AFTER 2 YEARS OF NIGHTLY USE.  COMPLETE TRASH.
 Beautiful and quiet.
 I bought this one based in reviews and urgently since my new apartment is oretty warm! It came with the base of the fan broken, I can tell this item was already returned once since the power cord was not wrapped properly and the remote didn't habe baterries. The fan seems to work ok, but I paid for a new fan, not a broken one! Returning and running to Walmart to buy one for tonight!
 I bought this fan because it had really great reviews, but I am actually disappointed by it.  First of all, it only has about a 45 degree angle in which the air blows.  Second, it doesn't blow much air.  Even on the highest setting, this fan is good only for a small room.  My kid's room is about 9x11 and it is fine for her room; any bigger and it would be useless.  It is quiet, but I'd take more noise if I could get greater airflow from it.  The only reason I won't return it is because I don't want to go through the hassle and unfortunately, we already got rid of the box.
 Good quality fan! Pretty decent price and it looks pretty nice as well. I lost the remote to this a while back, but you dont really need it. I like the wind settings and its sleek look.
 I absolutely love this !!! It has cooled our room down so much !! I highly recommend this product!!
 A great buy for the price
 I love this product
 Great product, works as advertised.
 Less than a year, and the fan stopped working.
 Came in with a button not working pressed in.<br/>Also it's not as great as other reviews said it was
 Terrible died in a month. DEAD DEAD. Don't buy Lasko!
 I was very happy with my pitches of the Laszlo fan. It was well worth  the price.
 This was a gift for my son and he loved it!
 Impressed works great.
 Bad
 It really cools the room down.
 Stopped working after 10 months. No good.
 The Lasko fan is a nice looking product. The buttons on the top of the fan make a loud obnoxious noise, but the fan works great and looks good.<br/><br/>I had this fan before and it was amazing...until my bf broke it. I'd prefer this Honewell fan over the Lasko:<br/> ...]
 Does not have the airflow i expected
 Great product! I'd recommend to anyone
 very slow
 Works great and doesn't take up a ton of space
 good
 Very nice - durable .. Worth the money 💰
 Broke 6 months later
 Stopped working!
 What happened..??  It arrived yesterday., 08/29., I've used it a little while.. then turned it off.. Today.. I turned it on and it worked Great until my AC kicked in.. Then I turned it on again and EH EH EH Changed outlets and batteries in the remote.. Still nothing..😱.. I mean I bought this specifically for my weekend guests.. again I ask What Happened..??..ARGGHHHH..😤😖😫
 Can only buy 1. Fan not as powerful as imagined
 This is a good looking fan.  It's also very quiet but then again, it hardly blows air, especially for larger rooms and spaces.<br/>We had to bring our 15 year old regular floor fan (Honeywell) back to our large master bedroom.  We placed the Honeywell on the opposite end of the room from this Lasko and boy, what a huge difference between the new and the old "Hun", which is far better in terms of air flow and oscillation range, which this Lasko barely reaches a 35 oscillating angle!  But the old yet fully functional Honeywell is noisy hence we wanted to try tower fans.<br/>The ionizer puts out a weird smell!  This is the best looking tower fan but looks without functionality makes no sense and is but a waste of money!<br/><br/>We purchased the Ozeri 42 oscillating tower fan and it's FAR better than the wind curve!  Lasko wind curve is a fiasco so no, I don't recommend this fan!  I'm quite happy we invested on Ozeri 42 inches tower fan and it looks pretty sleek...the Ozeri controls, air output, and oscillating range are far better!  I'm a regular consumer and didn't receive anything to review this product or to favor the Ozeri!!
 Great fan
 Nice product.... i recomended 100 '/'
 good product
 aesthetically pleasing, but not powerful enough
 Fan great! remote control never works
 DOA, wrong Item in BOX!
 works great
 Terrible product, doesnt work
 Isn't as powerful as I hoped.
 Great product works great.
 Great product.
 i did not reseve my remote or the scures
 Awesome product!!
 Does a great job, but after about 3 months any time I run the fan it makes a HORRIBLE burnt smell. Nothing seems to be hot, so I'm not sure why it smells like that. Very unfortunate.
 Fan stopped working after one week.  It seemed like a good product until it broke down.  Good packaging, average assembly instructions, good appearance.
 Great fan.
 This is the first negative comment I have made on a product purchased on Amazon.<br/><br/>After putting the fan together we were able to enjoy it for one week and then the oscillation stopped completely!!  We took the bottom off and retightened it and tried it again -no oscillation.
 I am the purchaser of all items, but not always the user. I am only aware if there is a problem, if someone complains. There was no complaint on this item.
 The box had been opened and was taped and crushed.<br/>There were no screws in the box, no batteries for the remote. We had to go to the store and find screws to fit.<br/>The fan is cheaply made.<br/>I would not have bought it if I had seen it in advance.<br/>I would not recommend this fan.<br/>I would not order from Amazon again.
 I purchased one of these and it stopped working. I did a product replacement and now that one has stopped working, but one day after the eligible return date.<br/><br/>DO NOT BUY. YOU WERE WARNED.
 The fan itself works great, however I never received any of the bolts to put it together so I cannot use it.<br/>I would be more than happy to update this review if I get my missing parts.
 I really had high hopes for this fan.  It isn't what I thought it would be.  Not much air and if it hot, the air is not cool.  Would not purchase.
 Like some of the other reviewers have stated the packageing is very poor.  Meaning that the vendor elects to ship the fan in its original box without being put in a shipping carton.  They just put a shipping label on the carton and off it went.  By the time I received the fan the top of the box was ripped off and the fan was defective.  I received a replacement which was ok but the shipping method was still the same.  Pretty dissapointed.
 Literally love this fan. The price is great and the quality is amazing. The fan speeds work well and produce a strong wind. Planning on buying a second one eventually, but for now, I just lug it back and forth between the living room and the bedroom-which is totally fine, because its light and easy to carry. Love the convenience of the remote as well as the timer functions for bedtime! This baby is extremely useful during this hot summer
 So far, I have purchased several of these beauties. Really good fans. Plus they compliment the style. Few problems with them. I will likely buy more when I get the money. The only downside is a bright led. That is nothing a small amount of tape over it cannot fix.
 I purchased this fan three weeks ago and after limited use the three functions of the fan is now one,medium is low speed,high is low speed. I called amazoon to get a replacement to see if this was just a fluke and hope so but I don't think so. I will keep you posted once the replacement arrives
 I bought my original 2 fans 7 years ago.  I loved them so much then, I bought them again this year when I needed to replace them.  The quality has not changed at all.  https://www.amazon.com/Lasko-2554-42-Inch-Curve-Remote/dp/B000RL1WNQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495217641&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lasko+42
 This item was a gray market item.  It was shipped to me in what looked to be a repackaged box and in poor condition.  After i set it up i noticed the remote looked to be a reject, because of the 4 buttons, 2 of them were the same and one was upside down.  Whenever I've seen this in the past its generally a gray market item the manufacturer rejects and is resold for a cheaper price.
 I ordered this because I saw it had gotten good ratings but I was very disappointed. After spending all the time putting the stand together turning it on was quite an experience. The fan or whatever is inside of it was banging so loud like it was loose and it thankfully shut off right away. I then had to dismantle the stand and repackage it to have it returned.<br/><br/>Don't buy it.
 Won't ever buy a fan online again.  Finally got it put together and it doesn't work.  It also doesn't fit back in the box.
 These Beautiful poems of Prabhu are not only rich in content ; but also each line of the verse form, dripping with  meaningful portrayal of  the entire Bible made easy for every age to follow them with absolute delight.<br/>So simplistic that ,this could be a source of spiritual Nourishment for every Child . So much so that , I consider it be  essential for each Sunday School to make Orders at the rate of one book of Christian Poems for every Child and to be presented with it for keep. Using this book of Poems would serve as a Supplementary Teaching aid  for the Sunday School Teachers too .<br/>I however have one suggestion in regard to the Price.To encourage bulk Orders by Churches, there needs to be substantial price discounts to the Institutions as that would also help in  bulk marketing .<br/>I Recommend Parents to buy one book for Each Child  to benefit from the lovely collection of Christian Poems.
 I bought this fan and when it finally arrived, I realized that i had received an all-silver fan, not the one I ordered (wood paneling detail) - i specifically picked the wood paneling one to match all my wood furniture. It would be way too big of a hassle to ship back, so i am keeping it, but to other buyers: what you buy may not be quite what you get.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this seems to be a great product. Just disappointed in not receiving the exact product i ordered.
 Very very little air flow! It's almost pointless to even use it.
 This fan is not worth the words...even on its top speed of 3, this fan has very little mojo. I have had other tower fans in the past but this is my first Lasko...and my last. In the scorching heat of the past 6 weeks, this fan offered neglible relief, at best. It is quiet and sleek....but i would willingly trade quiet for powerful fan action at this point. Truly disappointed in this purchase and seriously considering a return if thats still an option.
 Love it!  It's quite and like the times on it
 This product is something that I wish I never paid for when looking at it it looks beautiful on the outside but when you turn the fan on it hardly pulls out any air. If you were to ask me should you buy this I will tell you know I would not recommend anyone to purchase this product because of the fact that the cost is so much you can go and buy a box fan half the price and we'll get a better bargain. Best tower fan did not cool a small room off. Very disappointed with this product
 I guess its ok , dont blow as hard or rotate as mush as my last one. wont say what that make was
 The fan works good but the remote never worked i emailed the company and never heard back from them
 Best quality for a great price!
 returned was damaged. I thought it looked used.
 It was a cheap looking and very cheap construction.  Noisy as well.  so returned it asap to buy a better one
 very good
 I recently moved into a two-story home &amp; needed a fan that could really move the air around in our bedroom.  (Heat rises, you know... :) )  I researched several fans before settling on this one, &amp; I'm so glad I did!  This fan blows around a LOT of air, which is just what we needed.  It is an oscillating fan, which was something I couldn't find in the description when I ordered it.  It also has a remote control, which I honestly didn't think I'd use but have found myself using it every night.  I tend to read in bed before going to sleep, &amp; the remote control allows me to start my fan without getting up.  I realize this makes me lazy, but in my defense, I am half asleep when this happens.  Also, I've read some reviews where people have complained about the level of noise the fan produces.  It's definitely not a silent fan, but it's not "noisy" either.  I find the amount of sound that comes from it to be soothing, which actually helps me get to sleep.<br/><br/>This fan's features also include:<br/>-three levels of air flow<br/>-Fresh Air Ionizer technology<br/>-timer that can be set to 1/2 hr, 1 hr, 2 hrs, or 4 hrs
 Fan showed up with cracks in the base.  We had to pay to return it.
 We use
 It puts out a lot of air circulation.
 This was purchased as a Christmas gift.  We have about 6 of thes tower fans in our home.  Best thing in a fan we have found.
 The assembly instructions, operation and maintenance instructions  all come on ONE page in Two languages in the smallest print I have ever seen, starting with "interlocking the bosses on support base A"  ....the diagrams are so small I couldn't make them out even with magnifiers I use to get splinters out of my hands.  There are two types of screws,  but once again the diagram is so small (it looks like the bottom of a space ship), I cannot tell which one goes where.  But I do know there is a loose screw somewhere inside the fan that rattles when I turn it upside down.  Who wants to go through the hassle of repacking something this large and taking it back to the post office?  It does run when I plug it in, but of course it wobbles.<br/>Amazon provides no customer support.  No way to contact them.  I have purchased dozens and dozens of things from them, but I will NEVER again buy a large bulky item that is just too much hassle to return.  Needless to say I am really unhappy with this purchase from Amazon
 This fan is large in size, nice looking,  however,  even on the highest setting, the fan operates like its on the lowest setting.<br/>I am a previous Lasko Fan Owner similar to this model so I bought a second one.  This one is no comparison to my original one, yet<br/>they looked the same.  Disappointed, had to return it.
 Bought 2 Lasko fans for my son who moved into a 2 story apartment with no A/C. Visited him after fans were delivered.  They were great.  Quiet, got the air moving.  The only thing I didn't like was the blue light that stayed on which was distracting while trying to sleep (studies show that it is not good).  If Lasko could make a function to turn off the lights while keeping the fan running,  it would be absolutely perfect.  I bought the same fan for myself last year and it runs almost every night and is still quiet and doing its job.  Buy this one.  You won't be sorry!
 We need this noise to fall asleep at night and this system works well!  It's about as high as a traditional dresser and so can tuck nicely next to it without being an eye sore in the middle of your room.  It's also light weight so anyone can move it from room to room for when guests stay over night...
 Works great!
 It doesn't turn off if plugged in
 Bought this last summer.  It's been run a lot.  Does a good job.  Very quiet.
 Everything is great except the wind
 We got it because of the price. The one we had for years and years was a Seville and blew out air much better, Seville wanted too much money
 The fan produces a burning smell when used.  Very disappointed.
 One of the other reviewers mentioned that this fan's remote only works if you aim the remote directly at the fan and that you aren't too far away. Wow, were they ever right. You have to aim the remote dead on to the sensor to get it to work, often times pushing the button several times before it does work. We've moved the fan now so that it is past the foot of the bed and I can't use the remote anymore. The fan is too far away. If I want to use the remote in bed, I have to slide all the way to the bottom corner of the bed, lean forward and aim the remote directly at the fan's sensor. It's not worth it anymore, now I just get out of bed to turn it on and off. Kind of defeats the purpose of having the remote.<br/>Now, the pros is that it looks great, the sound is even and on the quieter side (but we like the white noise when we sleep), and fairly powerful air movement. You can direct the air pretty accurately. I still feel a great breeze even though it is kinda far away from the bed.<br/>The ION feature is really nice and even seems to cool the air in addition to filtering it.<br/><br/>Another note: the "ION" light is REALLY bright. It was like having a nightlight in our bedroom. Additionally, the plastic cover that goes over the light and indicator panel is kind of transparent, so when I tried covering the light with electrical tape I realized the light isn't just coming out of the "light hole," it's also coming out most of the transparent plastic cover too, which is kinda large. I ended up having to cover about half of the indicator panel with electrical tape and I can still see the light. I wish it would just go off after a certain period of being on, but no such luck. I'm sure me having to use that much electrical tape (which fortunately blends in well) doesn't help the remote sensor issue.
 Received product in good time.  But box contained wrong parts.  The base is supposed to comprise 2 complementary pieces that interconnect:  "Support Base A" and "Support Base B".  The box I received had two "B"s and no "A"s, which means the product cannot be assembled and used. Have sent a message to Lasko via their website (1-800 number not answering).  Let's see how quickly they respond.  Will provide an update based on experience.<br/><br/>UPDATE # 1:  Following several emails and phone calls Lasko sent me replacement parts for the base.  Unfortunately, they sent the wrong parts (intended for a different model), so I still cannot assemble and use the fan.  Amazing.  This experience does not inspire confidence.  Let's see if third time is the charm.  Will provide a further update based on experience.<br/><br/>UPDATE #2:  A further week later (so more than 2 weeks since initial order) the Lasko team sent the correct parts for the base. Fan now assembled and works as expected. So after-sale service not perfect but OK if you can persevere...
 I ordered this a little less than a month ago hoping to get a little relief from the heat. My master bedroom is upstairs and it can definitely get stuffy even with my thermostat set to 70 degrees downstairs . This little fan has made a world of difference - it circulates cool air throughout the room and actually does so very quietly. The remote is an added bonus and I have had no issues! All in all, a great buy!
 Please DO NOT buy this fan. Waste of money, $10 fans are much better than this. Looks like a huge fan but doesnot work properly at all. Even if the fan is 5 feet away from you, you feel its miles away.
 Only had it a week before it was destroyed in a apartment fife
 Broke after two days of very limited use. Will not power on. Too bad I already threw away the packaging and everything. What a waste of money.
 Fan started to make a rattling noise only after 2 days of use. It's too loud to use when going to sleep!
 I have four of these all over the house and they are wonderful to circulate the air, cut down on using the air conditioner.  They are quiet and I love the tower!
 Ordered the Lasko 2551 WindCurve platinum after reading great reviews and 4/5 stars all over.. here is my ratings and reason after receiving it.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>1. Its tall!! 42 inches, that was one prime reason I chose this one.<br/>2. Looks ok, doesn't create much noise and does everything fan is supposed to do like give air and rotate to some angle<br/>3. Light weight and easy to assemble<br/><br/>The bad:<br/>1. The piece I got, remote doesn't work. I can live with that, wouldn't have used it much anyway. Thing to note here is they don't give batteries with the unit so I had to buy batteries just for this purpose and then it didnt work, so that was kind of annoying.<br/><br/>2. Build, touch and material it uses, I have a feeling that its not gonna last long...<br/><br/>Will update this review later once it dies..!!
 Great fan works really well.
 I like the design.
 Arrived damaged!
 This is so tall!!! Be warned it is very tall. But otherwise, I love it and I am keeping it. My only complaint....way too tall and large....but I do love it. Thanks Lasko
 have stoke. can't write at much, can't review. please don't asking
 It's not good
 its a tower fan... what did you think your going to find out by reading this response.  its not super quiet, its not super loud, remote is great!
 When the box was delivered, it was obviously used.  The box was already opened.  They tried to tape it back together, but this is simply unacceptable.  I will complain to Amazon.
 This fan visually is amazing!!! And with a name and perks that dazzle(iOn Button😂). Who wouldn't want the 2551 Wind Curve Platinum? THIS GUY. Not to mention the price, quality is one thing. But the power of this pretty contradiction is laughable at best. Up close it's decent....and I mean that delicately. Not my favorite, but for lack of better terms. It's a fuckable fan 😈.
 I bought this fan in July, 2013, but did not need it until now, when we are between air conditioning and heat.  The fan was bought from Warehouse Deals and it was sent to me broken.  The box was damaged, but not in the place it needed to be to break the fan blades inside and not damage the outside of the fan.. You should be more careful about selling returned item, because it was broke when you shipped it. I will no longer recommend Amazon to any of may friends.  I feel this was a dishonest transaction on your part, as it<br/>apparently not checked out before it was sold to me.
 I gave it as a gift
 it's a really good fan
 I have an earlier version of this fan, and I'm happy to report that this one keeps all of the good stuff with only a few insignificant changes.<br/><br/>First and foremost, this fan moves a lot of air and is pretty quiet. You can easily watch TV or have a conversation while it's on high. It moves enough air to ruffle papers on your desk, although it's not so intense that it'll blow them away.<br/><br/>It has a small footprint but is very stable; we often keep ours tucked back in a corner, and have it oscillating to cover the couch during the summer months.<br/><br/>The two changes that I've noticed from the earlier version is that it abandoned the (completely pointless?) ION mode in favor of night mode. I guess night mode makes the lights slightly dimmer, although it turns on a second LED, so now you have twice as many lights, even if they are a little dimmer (and they aren't particularly bright, anyhow), and it's supposed to slightly reduce the intensity of the fan, although I didn't notice any change.<br/><br/>The second change is that they changed the remote and the on-fan remote storage. The old remote is bigger, blockier, and seems more well-built. The new remote is slightly sleeker, but certainly seems cheaply made and likely to break. And the old version used to have a slot where you could fully insert the remote in the back of the fan, which was really secure. The new version just has a little plastic tab (which will probably break off) that hooks on to the back of the fan. It's not super secure (although it won't fall off unless you bump it).<br/><br/>Still, the fan itself is great, and you'll be happy if you buy it.
 I purchased this tower fan (from Target) for the purpose of keeping a bedroom with no overhead fan cool/"fanned". I wanted to avoid the look of a traditional circular "wheel on a stick" fan &amp; go with something more attractive.<br/><br/>Looks GREAT &amp; very modern. Operates via remote control- has 3 fan speeds, option of holding still or oscillating, &amp; a "ionization" feature that supposedly offers some benefit to air quality (but in actuality does nothing, since the fan will grow dust tails on the inside).<br/><br/>That being said, the air power from this tower isn't very powerful. Even the highest setting isn't enough to "feel a breeze" from halfway across my 10'x10' room. Definitely not suitable for "whole room cooling". Also since the fan itself starts very close to the bottom of the mount &amp; the tower itself is shorter, you WILL NOT feel any breeze or cooling while lying in an average height bed (maybe if you had your mattress on the floor).<br/><br/>All in all, looks great but really doesn't deliver significant cooling action. If that is ok with you, go ahead. But I find the traditional fans on a stick to be much more powerful.
 My Lasko 2551 is working very well!!
 This is a good fan. It is quiet and effective, as well as being reasonably pleasant to look at. It does NOT take the place of an air conditioner by blowing *cold* air, as some reviews imply. I’m not quite sure why they think that it does. But it does make life in 90 degree weather in the New Mexico high desert (where ac is mostly unheard of) more pleasant.  I just got it so I cannot speak to its longevity, and I did not buy it from Amazon (Amazon’s new contract with the post office makes purchases very problematic for rural areas).
 this thing sucks. l had to return it
 We have purchased four of these fans over the past 6-7 years. All have worked great. I sit about 8 feet from my fan and even on low speed you can feel the breeze. When our a/c wasn't working it needed high speed, but that was with room temperatures in the mid 80s. We have two in our living room/entertainment center. The other fan is at least 10 feet from me and I can also feel it blowing. My only complaints with our latest purchase, a couple days ago: (1) they have eliminated the molded-in remote slot, so now the remote hangs on the back; and (2) this fan motor has a definite hum. With the other three fans, all at least three years old, the motors are whisper-quiet -- the only noise is the air being moved. The fans have three speeds; either oscillate or steady; an ionizer; and a timer. Our oldest fan (6-7 years old) still works great, but it creaks when oscillating. This just developed this summer (2017) so I don't think we can complain. This is a good deal at $55 or so, but any more than that is robbery.
 My daughter recently moved home from college and took my Honeywell Quietset 8 speed fan for her room so I had to buy a second fan. Wished I had bought a second Honeywell Quietset instead of this Lasko 2551  The Honeywell Quietset 8 speed that I've had for 2 years is a better fan. The Honeywell moves more air, has more settings, and is just built better. The Lasko does not have a steady base, was shipped missing a screw, and remote came without batteries included. In my opinion the Honeywell is a better fan than the Lasko. I've had a Honeywell quietset fan for 2 years and I'm very happy with it. Very reliable, runs quiet, and moves lots of air. I made the mistake of buying a Lasko 42" wind curve platinum model 2551.
 I have never owned better fans than those by Lasko.  My original one lasted 11 years running day and night.  I bought the Platinum two years ago and even in the winter, I run it at night, just directing the air flow away from me.  There is a very faint noise, nothing obnoxious at all, and it helps drown out the road noise in front of my building but it does not interfere with the TV or with talking on the phone.  The ionizer light is no different, no brighter than the blue light on the front of my cable box.  These machines are work horses.  I bought mine at Walmart during a sale.  The only changes I would like to see would be for the front face and back face to be hinged so they could be opened to clean the device.  Since that is only a wish at present, I buy long-handled cotton tipped applicators at the pharmacy and very gently go in through the louvers to get the "dust bunnies" on the inner mechanism.  It takes about 2 hours to do it thoroughly but it does get it clean.  Anything that drops without the applicator catching it generally blows out when I turn the fan back on and I can vacuum it up.  I know some take the fan apart but I am unable to do so; therefore, the applicators work for me.  Someone recommended directing a leaf blower at it but I would be afraid that would blow dust into the inner workings.  I may try canned air when it needs another cleaning.  Before my first Lasko I had box fans and oscillating fans on stands.  Nothing I have ever had compares with my two Lasko fans.  It is rare to find a product with which I am as happy, or one that performs well amnd lasts as long as these do.  Great product.  I wrote to Lasko tonight and suggested they add a hinged front and back to aid cleaning, or else provide us with a long, narrow brush to get the fuzzies inside.  When I hear from them, I will post again.  I will add that I live in an apartment complex and running the fan near the a/c unit helps keep my cooling costs down in the summer and it is strong enough that I can turn the a/c off at night and run just the fan.
 If I had written this review right after getting this fan I would have written how much I liked it. However its been 6 months and my opinion is quickly starting to falter. You see, in that last few days I've noticed that when I turn on the fan it is slow as if it has trouble working and the wind it creates is very weak or even non-existent. After a few minutes the speed of air it generates gets back to what it should be. I've only noticed this when it is set on low. Essentially its acting like a fan that is ready to die. I hope it doesn't.
 I’m a bit of an oscillating-fan nerd and this is my first tower fan. We have no a/c and bought it during a sultry heat wave. It wound up in the hot gable bedroom because it is so much quieter than the other seven we had running. It will sweep the bed with a vertical column of air. The ionizer seemed to take out a bit of the monsoon dank.<br/>I’d take a few more speeds, including a lower one. The ion indicator is too bright for the bedroom but is easily masked.<br/>Very efficient oscillation means it could last a long time. I don’t intend to test knocking it over.
 Whether or not I would recommend this fan would require too many caveats. On the pro side - it is quiet (so far), easy to assemble, attractive, and produces a nice gentle breeze. The nice gentle breeze could also be seen as a con. In my case, I will usually only require this fan be cooling me as I sleep. It is set up approximately 8' from my head. At the highest setting I can feel the air, but I would describe it as a very gentle breeze from this distance. On the con side - does not produce a lot of air movement. Additionally, the extent of the oscillation seems VERY narrow. Lasko describes it as "widespread oscillation". They may want to check the definition of widespread. This may be suitable for a child's room, a nursery, a bathroom, a very small study, etc. I live in a studio apartment where my bed is located immediately beside my couch and the "living space" and I do not believe this fan is powerful enough to be effective in that small area. All this said - I will likely keep it for the time being and see if it provides enough airflow overnight, plus in my small space, a tower fan makes more sense than a traditional box fan and the like.
 I received this fan as a wedding gift in 2012. it has survived 4 moves, one toddler, one spastic dog, quite a few kicks and tumbles, and we're really bad about cleaning it... Let's be honest, I've probably only vacuumed it off like 5 times ever.<br/>We live in the desert, so from March-October we never turn this fan off. It is currently the only source of air movement in our vaulted ceiling living room.<br/>One concern I had once my daughter became mobile was that she would lean on the fan and knock it over, but it's more stable than you would expect a tall narrow tower fan to be! So far she's never tipped it over, even when running headlong into it. Our brute of a dog has plowed it to the ground a few times but it's no worse for the ware.<br/>All that being said, it blows air as powerfully as the day we bought it. It doesn't squeak or whistle or rattle at all, even when oscillating (which it is pretty much always doing).<br/>My one and only complaint is that there is no way to open the fan up and truly give it a deep clean without completely disassembling it and risking ruining it.<br/>In my opinion, it's pros greatly out-weigh this one con. In fact, I've come on here to buy a second one for my toddler's bedroom!
 This Lasko tower fan is decent. The weight is evenly balanced from the base to the top, with controls at the top. The vents can be adjusted up and down easily and the no clean ion filter is a definite plus. The fan is very quiet and has typical controls of rotation, and fan speeds 1-3. My biggest complaint is that I feel the air output isn't the best. I have a circular fan that spins faster, this is good to cool a medium size room or below. If you are looking for a fan for white noise in the background this is a little too quiet for that. Like I said it could blow a little harder to keep things cool. My wife loves this fan but i'm not as sold as she is, I guess I like more air than it provides. For the value, this fan is worth buying as it is good quality and would recommend this product.
 It's incredibly rare I give a product one star. I even liked Lasko fans. I grew up with them exclusively. But I spent $60 on a fan in preparation for the summer. I should have bought the Honeywell. This one randomly quit working after only one week. Unbelievable. It's a fan for Christ's sake. How difficult could it be to make one that has a simple motor or two that can last at least a couple years?
 AWESOME fan for indoor use!<br/>Its very quiet, has an ionizer (if thats your thing), GREAT timer that can be set to any 1/2hr increment up to 7.5hours, decent air flow on low, good air flow on high (not a shop fan, but perfect for a normal indoor rooms). We turn it on to go to sleep 5 out of 7 nights a weeks with a timer set to turn off in 1hr. Best of all, I've had it quite awhile now and it still works like new (though I did have to draw the numbers back on with silver sharpie)
 My house only has one grounded plug in the livingroom for a window AC, which doesn't do a thing for the bedrooms. I have a thermometer on my bureau that measures the temp in my room as 80. I bought this fan to blow on me at night and I am amazed at the coolness of the air that this thing circulates...it almost feels like an AC! Even on the hottest nights, the air blowing on me is so cool that I always have to cover up with a sheet. It comes with a remote so I can control it from my bed...it has an oscillation feature too, so even if it's stationary I can hit the button while lying down to make it turn to the exact position that I want it to stand in. Give this fan a chance; you will NOT be sorry.
 I LOVE the fan, oscillator, ionizer, timer, etc., but you have to take the whole thing apart to clean the filter!!  AND, instructions only say you need a screwdriver, but you need a TRIANGLE screwdriver, which is less common...in fact, I've never used one.  You have to take out about a dozen screws and the base and disassemble the whole casing to get to the filter.  In this day and age?  It should pop right out and back in easily.  The instruction manual doesn't have cleaning instructions or how to disassemble.  Good luck!
 Purchased this for my living room to help cut down on electricity costs this summer.  I have a very long apartment, with A/C units in the bedrooms at the end of the hall (about 20 feet long), so the cool air tends to get trapped in the hall and not quite make it to the living room, so we end up running the A/Cs pretty hard (Midwestern summers can be intense).  We have a box fan in the hall to push air down here, and purchased the Wind Curve to move the air in the living room.  I'm glad I picked this one!<br/><br/>I am impressed with this fan.  The air flow is nice and refreshing, enough so that even on the lowest setting, you can feel the breeze 15 feet away.  The fan is nice and quiet, even on the highest setting, and easy to assemble.  The keys do not beep when you change the speeds, so that's good, too.  I haven't used the remote yet (I forgot to pick up AAA batteries), but I like the little storage compartment on the back of the unit, very handy.  The base is wide and sturdy, making the unit as a whole feel solid, which is reassuring!  Overall, very pleased with this purchase!
 I am really suprised at all of the one star reviews, shocked actually. I bought this fan 5 years ago, I loved it so much that I bought 4 more within 2 years and all of them are amazing, I turn one on when I sleep on the lowest setting for 4 hours and I fall asleep with ease. It's not the same as a box fan, it's almost like it cools down the air as it circulates, so it doesn't blow hot air like other fans do
 Was upset when I received this fan. It states both in the title and description that it is a "cooling fan."  For those of you that have been searching for tower fans, you know there are fans that actually cool the air - not full air conditioner - but cool it slightly.  That's what I thought I was buying. Because well, that's exactly what it says. But NO.  It's just a regular tower fan.  Also, the clip on the remote was broken off (perhaps during shipping?)<br/><br/>That being said the fan is pretty quiet and does have good air flow.  So instead of slamming them with 1 star for bad representation, if you are looking for just a regular good tower fan, this one is ok.
 My in-laws had this fan and I loved it so I got my own.  I didn't purchase from amazon this time though.  My room is never right temp, always too hot or too cold.  Since setting up this fan I've been able to keep the air-conditioning for our bedroom set at 80 degrees but it's still cool.  the fan blows quite a bit of air because I'm about 20 feet away from it right now and can feel the nice cool air being blown.  The air forced out of the fan DOES feel cool.  I live it hot Las Vegas and it's August.  I haven't really used the ionizer to notice whether or not it works well.  The blue light doesn't bother us either way, I don't feel it's abnormally bright for sleeping.  I don't think it's overly noisy either.  You can hear it more than a ceiling fan but it's just a white noise anyways.  I'd say it's quieter than one of those wall unit air conditioners though.  I'm going to order one from Amazon for our bonus room too.  I love it!
 I purchased this fan when our prev one was just old and dirty and could not be cleaned anymore. I liked this fan because it has the ionizer. Which works great. However, the fan arrived with a few pieces broken (By where it was screwed together) my boyfriend was able to resolve as we didn't want to send back and then wait for another fan to be sent out. Everything was fine for a few months. And then it started rattling in the night (at least once) now it rattles intermittently and is not dirty or anything. So I'm looking for a different fan. This definitely wasn't worth the 43$ I spent. Maybe 15$ but not this much as you can tell it is cheaply made and it's very loud so it disrupts our sleep when the reason we have it is for our sleep.
 I love this fan so far. Good height. And good FAM strength. Actually feels close to AC. Like a really nice continuous breeze. Its almost silent on low speed. And barely a hum on medium. It does start to sound like a regular fan on high but I haven't needed it on high at all. Usually with fans I get stuffy at night but I noticed with the ionizer on with low or medium speed I'm perfectly fine. I already knocked it over after a few days and its still working perfect lol. The remote is good. Just gotta point it DIRECTLY at the fan. Lol . Also, the blue light for when the ionizer is on , is pretty bright. Not annoying bright but if ur scared of the dark at 30 like me , it gives a nice glow in the room lol
 I really wanted to like this product as I was looking for a good heater for a while. I assembled the bottom part as instructed in the manual but it still was unstable. I figured its unsafe to use around my baby. I ended up returning. Phew, it is tall in size...it was pain to load and unload to bring it to the UPS store.
 If you want this for moving air it works perfectly. However after reading a lot of the reviews about this creating some good white noise, sadly this does not deliver. Perhaps I am used to the lightly louder humming from the wall-mounted air conditions with AC off during the winter. This is about 1/4 of that volume and does not drown out volume in regards to white noise, for those who require a bit more white noise. There is a fan made by the same company that I have used when visiting family and has a lot of volume. I will update this review when I get that model.
 I have several Lasko fans. All run silently, were inexpensive, and last a long time.<br/>I have one that runs constantly in the bedroom, which let's me keep the A/C set at 75, not 72.<br/>So, Lasco has a good reputation for me.<br/>The round stand fan took up too much space in the office, so I tried their Wind curve fan.<br/>First, it's bigger than I expected. I know, it's 42", but I pictured smaller. But that's good, it moves a lot of air.<br/>It is so quiet on low, I can't hear it and it's 6' from me.<br/>I've only had it a week, but I'm extremely pleased.<br/>I bought mine at Home Depot, because I got free shipping to the store in a couple of days.
 We really wanted to like this fan, but it simply wasn't the 'top performer' that the writeup claimed it to be.  Yes, it oscillates but not a "wide area oscillation" as the write-up claimed it had.  After ordering the fan, I just happened to notice a bunch of tower fans at stores, businesses, offices, houses etc and ALL of them seemed stronger and had a larger oscillation radius than this did.  I gave it an extra star, because it was pretty easy to assemble.  I can't say how well the remote worked, because we didn't even try it.  I hate returning items, but we just had to return it &amp; will be picking up one of the fans that we saw at Costco that are stronger with a larger oscillation radius at a lower price.  They don't have the ionizing feature that this fan has, but that's not as important for our application.
 It works. I ask the eager young man at Walmar, he was a young 50 year old one question..."Will it cool an old man, I am 80, cool at night?" He answered..."Yes!" I said "Sold!".....and it does. Any questions?
 I bought this fan in August 2009 and loved it so much that I bought another in June 2010 despite reading many reviews online complaining about a clicking noise their fan made. Although I still have no problems with the first fan I purchased, the second fan (exact same model) does periodically make a faint clicking sound. I almost sounds as if there is something loose inside that fan and it is lightly tapping the side. It does not make the noise constantly and it is soft enough that I am not bothered by it. I'm not going to return the fan however I will probably take it apart to determine what is causing this noise. I'll update you if I do this.<br/><br/>Overall, the fan is still much quieter than many others and is a good value at this price. Most tower fans this large are more expensive. If you are worried about the noise and want to be able to easily return the fan if you don't like it, buy it at Walmart. Last year I bought mine at the end of summer and got it on sale making it a great value.
 I bought this fan last year and it's still working fine. But I find myself looking for a new one because I find it too noisy to use while I'm trying to work in my home office. It's larger than any previous tower fan I've owned. I don't oscillate but I do use the timer for nights when I don't want to wake up cold at 4 a.m.
 I love this fan, we received it as a registry gift &amp; I couldn't be happier! It stands up very sturdy, it blows decently cool air, it's not loud unless you have it on the highest setting, but even then it is not LOUD. It's great. I'm so glad we got this fan! :)
 This product came shipped in the product box, with no outer box (the merchant I purchased from was The Nerds/Computer Nerds International). The box was delivered by Fedex with multiple gashes and dents in it.<br/><br/>When I opened the box, the product was damaged. Luckily, the only damage was to the base, which was cracked in 3 places. I contacted The Nerds (the seller) who promptly issued me a return authorization (including free return shipping). However, since only the base (a very small plastic part) was damaged, I decided to call Lasko to ask how much a replacement part cost. The first time I called Lasko, I requested a callback and received one in a few hours. I hadn't yet decided at that time whether to return the fan back to The Nerds, or to get a replacement.<br/><br/>I decided that it didn't make sense to ship the entire fan back for a small part. The Nerds promptly refunded me the cost of a replacement part.<br/><br/>I called Lasko again on their 800 number. I was put on hold for 1.5 hours. Nobody ever picked up. When I hung up and called again, I received a message that they were closed for the day. This was at 4:15pm EST, and they are supposed to be open until 5pm EST. (I noticed this on several successive days calling - any calls past 4pm EST got the message "our offices are closed, please call back during business hours.")<br/><br/>I called again the next day, and the next day after that. Each time I was put on hold for a long time, and each time I requested a callback. I never was able to get through to a person, nor did I receive a callback.<br/><br/>The irony is the on-hold message when you call Lasko goes something like "we apologize for the long wait time, this is unusual for us." HA! EVERY SINGLE time I have called (6-8 times), I have been put on hold for 20 - 90 minutes. This is certainly NOT unusual for Lasko, and must be their decision to under-staff their customer service call center.<br/><br/>I also sent messages through Lasko's website contact form. I received an autoreply, but nobody ever responded to my request to order a part.<br/><br/>Note this replacement part was not available to order online from Lasko's website. The only replacement part listed on their website for this fan is a replacement remote control.<br/><br/>As for the fan - it's a very good product. As many others have reviewed, it blows a lot of air, relatively quietly. It looks nice standing in the corner. While it feels somewhat cheap and plasticky, it looks nice. I wasn't bothered by a big blue LED light like some other folks.<br/><br/>So - if you get this, pray your product comes undamaged (ideally the merchant will put the product box inside another box and ship it). Otherwise you will have to deal with a totally non-responsive customer service operation at Lasko.<br/><br/>Net - 4 stars for a good product, 1 star for horrible, awful, non-responsive customer service by Lasko. (Kudos to the seller/merchant The Nerds for good customer service on their part, although in the future they should ship this with an outer box.)<br/><br/>++++++++++++++++<br/><br/>UPDATE: lo and behold, just as I was thinking I wouldn't hear from Lasko, they finally called me (around 4 days after I requested a callback). So much for their "we will save your place in line and call you back when it's your turn." Either they have a severely understaffed call center, or there are so many people calling them that they can't answer until many days later. Thankfully, I was able to place an order for the damaged part. However, consistent with Lasko's poor customer service processes, the service rep wasn't able to send me a confirmation email for the order as "our email system is down for the day."
 Yeah, it's probably made in China, but they got it right.<br/>I didn't need the remote, but it works fine.<br/>I have it in the office and it's on speed #1 and I can't hear it. Very Quiet.<br/>It allows me to leave the A/C on 75 instead of 72. This make the 4th Lasko fan I own, and all are troopers. (The other three are 18" stand round fans.)<br/>I bought mine at Home Depot, because I got free shipping to the store in a few days and it was $15 less.<br/>I will say it's a bit larger than I expected. I know it's 42" but it's got some girth too.<br/>All things considered, I love it.
 just got one , very easy to install the base , took 2 minutes .... it is very very quiet and does the job .... we use at night to sleep .... 100% satisfied ... light and easy to store /move .... I did not buy it on amazon they were out of stock ... ebay 39 bucks delivered .... wish I would have bought two !  buy it you will like it ...
 Fan is fairly quiet and moves the air around nicely. If you are in a very hot area it might not be enough horse power for you. That being said, it's not an air conditioner. Fan doesn't wobble around and kinda just blends into the background. The mounting screws are hidden in the packaging, so make sure you have everything before you throw away the packaging. A nice fan for the price.
 Easy to assembly and works really well in temps around 70 degrees.  I live in Seattle and the summers seem to be getting warmer.  When the temp reached 80 and above this fan struggled to keep me cool.
 Believe me I do my homework, before I buy something, But this time I really failed.<br/>I did online search but to see it physically was not possible. I couldn't find this one in the store. But review from the people was all 5 stars or 4 stars and it looks good in the picture. Yes, this fan from Lasko really looks good, I was happy when I opened the box and assembled it. Assembling can't not be easier  either. However when I turned on the Fan, I was disappointed. It doesn't move air too well. It was quite then after an hour, it started making rattling sound. I hoped it might get better, but midle of the night I turned off the fan, because the noise was too much. It has inonizer and a blue LED light comes on when ionizer is on but you do'nt feel or smell the typical Ozon. the remote control does work if you press button from 3 feet away. So whwt is the use of remote when you have to get up and walk to the fan then use remote? (Battery was new). So you have a very good looking fan, but nothing on it seems to work right. This fan is not cheap eighter. I returned it very next morning and my suggestion? Don't buy
 Purchased this fan less than a week ago. Very disappointed with the volume of air it moves. You can do better with a 10 $ fan from wherever. In two days I now have a noise from the unit. Sounds like a vibration. Very annoying. Can hear it over my 55" Samsung tv next to it. This is a con. Do not buy this fan.
 Purchased based on another fan I had by the same manufacturer and I liked the form factor and ionizer. Assembly was a piece of cake. Air flow was decent, but my issue is the noise. Not really loud, but annoying whirring competed with the tv. I bought it so I didn't have to keep moving another fan, but I'm going to return it. Very disappointed... again, it's the frequency of the fan. I dunno, but am not satisfied.
 Based on the reviews I was expecting a ton of air to be pushed out of this fan. Unfortunately it is not as strong as I hoped. But it is fine for a small room, and it takes up very minimal space.
 I had bought two units of the same model, one month apart, because I am so impressed by its performance. Both work wonderfully. The machine came with three levels of wind speed, an ionizer that actually works to eliminate odor, and a timer to set up to 7.5 hours. One thing I have to mention is how quiet it is. Even at the highest speed it barely make any noticable noise. In comparison I had one of those fancy ionizer-fan from shaper-image or brookstone, and that sounds like a WWII fighter plane taking off when turned on, let alone/not to mention the higher price tag.<br/><br/>This summer this beauty is going to save me a lot on air contiditioning for sure!
 I bought this fan in 2006 (yes, exact same design) and the main bearing has failed after 6 years of heavy use.  Other fans have a high pitched whine from the motor, where this one has a subtle whurr.  The look of the fan is like a piece of furniture, as it should be.  Competitive fans look like a giant blender to me, some are down right hideous.  I've just ordered another lasko, I hope it lasts as long as the last one.  I highly recommend this fan, especially if you don't like persistant high pitched whining noises coming from your fan.  Hope it helps!
 Very good product. This fan is pretty quiet. I do not have to raise the TV volume when I put this fan on. If someone says it's loud then their fan is broken.<br/><br/>The air volume is decent....not a tornado but no slouch either. The best feature for me is that it takes up very little room compared to a traditional fan. It looks like a piece of furniture &amp; the remote is great. Lastly, my 2 year old son can't hurt his fingers when he sticks them in the slots because the blade is far recessed compared to a traditional fan.
 I love this fan, it keeps me comfortable and cools as much as you would expect a fan to cool.  (It works for Texas heat!) It is quiet, so much that I can forget it is on (and I most often have it on the highest speed.  My greatest fear with fans is noise, this one is definitely not at all!  It is so quiet, the only way you know it's on is the feel of air touching you.  I love the remote, and especially I love the rotating it does.
 My husband and I got this as a wedding gift and it is a great fan.  It cools down our front room (granted, it's not a very big room) and it's not too loud.  It rotates pretty far around and there's a little ledge on the back if you need to pick it up and move it.  It's a high quality fan and I enjoy it very much.  We haven't had any problems with it so far, but I will update if I see any potential issues.
 We loved this fan but sadly one week after the 1 year mark it stopped oscillating. Still works great but now we need to buy a new one because of that. I cant stand a fan blowing directly on me, which is why i spent this much on one rhat oscillates.
 My mom bought one of these for me a few years ago. During the summer I can leave it running for days at a time and there's been 0 issues. The paint wore off of the buttons but I know what they all do now anyway.
 I bought one of these over 6 years ago (possibly 7-9 years ago - I've had it so long I don't exactly remember when I got it). I used it pretty much year round. This past weekend, the motor finally gave out on the fan. It was a really reliable fan. I highly recommend it.
 I've had this fan for four years and found it very quiet and considerably more powerful than I needed for my apartment.  This year, however, due to the intensely wet summer and fall,there has been a mold or fungus bloom, probably in the crawl space under the apartment.  There has been a persistent odor, something like an overfilled ashtry, strong enough that I began having headaches, which I rarely get, and was sneezing constantly.  On a whim, I turned on the ion setting on this fan.  I understand the scientific claims behind this device but I doubted this simple fan could really make a difference.<br/>I was quite wrong.  The following morning, the room I had left the fan in was completely free of the stench. I have since moved it through the apartment and now no longer can find the odor at all.  I still need the landlord to do something about the source but at least I can live here comfortably again.<br/>This is an amazing piece of equipment and cheaper than the competitors.
 Bought this to compensate for the fact that apartments in Seattle don't have A/C yet regularly is in the 70s/80s+ in the summer (CRAZY)! This fAn is a godsend. It is the perfect size and circulates air very well, almost feels like the air coming out is cooled.<br/><br/>The timer settings are convenient too with varying options. Great to set before falling asleep.
 Quite possibly the most useless use of materials and labor, ever!  Bought it elsewhere in an emergency.  Am 3' away from the fan as I write this, can barely feel a breeze!  Fanning with a magazine would be more effective.  Beyond me that such a useless product exists!
 This is a pretty decent fan, initially I was happy to have it. Yet I still decided to return mine. Unfortunately it started making an odd burning smell or odor shortly after using it, and I became distrusting towards leaving it running for long periods of time.  Also, the smell was not desirable. But as far as construction, were one to be in excellent working order - it is pretty solid. It is huge for one thing, so if you don't want a large, masculine looking tower fan (esp with the cherry wood trim) - this one is not for you. Decent air speed and power with this fan, could be a tad better, but very poor oscillation band/width. That is a setback. Good settings though overall, nice functions and layout. Remote works great. Attractive design, looks, etc., but again, extra large in size. Must be a solid 48" tall. Something to think about, if you are big on aesthetics. Similar to the other Lasko fan I reviewed,  I would say this could be good in very large rooms with vaulted ceilings, workspaces, home gyms, pool areas and patios, etc.. Thanks!
 I really like this fan and have this in a few rooms.  They are a great fan to have around.  I purchased a few of them in a brick and mortar store.  They are easy to use even my 5 year old knows how to use it.
 It’s slim and looks good in any room.  Takes up very little space.  Makes such a difference in keeping us more comfortable in our Arizona heat.
 arrived today, doesn't blow strongly as a fan would though. Didn't come with battery (uses 2 aa)
 When i took it out of the box i loved the modern design, which went perfectly to my decor. I dont think my bedroom is big 14x20, and on the highest setting i barely felt a breeze when it was aiming right at me lying in bed at 5ft away!!! Really disappointed because i wanted to keep it but it just doesnt do its job. Will be returning it. Also found it weird that it didnt come with the batteries (ive never bought something that required batteries and it didnt come with it). And definitely wobbly when the buttons are touched, not when the fan is on.
 If you're looking for a fan to really blow some air Lasko is not the one for you. We bought 2. This one and another one at Walmart and both fans were a disappointment. You just want to feel cool when that fan hits you and Lasko fans don't do it for me. We thought they would be like the Bionaire fan we bought at Home Depot and not even close!
 Our 10 year old version of this recently died and was used almost daily.  We used it primarily in the bed room for both routine circulation between heating and air cycles, and to provide a nominal amount of white noise.<br/><br/>Will need to purchase a new one come the spring and this will be at the top of the options list.
 as described-delivered on time despite saying it was not
 I've owned this fan for a few years, am just now getting around to reviewing it because the noise it makes is so frustrating! I've read other reviews that people having the "ticking" sound, I'm sure I'm past my warrantee period but wish I had returned it a while ago. The noise is unbearable, I can't keep it on when I sleep. Also, the dust accumulates like crazy in this fan and it's really difficult (nearly impossible) to clean out.
 This is the best fan I have ever had.  I just bought another one.
 This is perfect in my room. I had another one just like this in my room that went caput. So glad I bought this because it's so quiet and it puts out a pretty strong wind.  I am the type that has to have airflow when I sleep and a ceiling fan just doesn't always do the trick.  This has many features that I'm very happy with.
 I was happy with the first one I bought a year ago and just purchased another one.  So far they are both working very well. The unit has options for directing air to one area or moving side to side, and it provides sufficient cooling for a large bedroom without blasting the air. Best of all, it is quiet relative to most fans or (moderately-priced) ceiling fans. I am usually a light sleeper and I have no trouble sleeping with it on.  Even though it is tall, it looks decent enough to tuck it in a corner when not in use rather than storing it away.
 Bought this used, knowing there would be minimal damage. There is much more than minimal damage, control panel is broken, did not come with all of necessary mounting screws or tool to install, bottom brackets are bent. No batteries for controller. Was said that total damge was below 5%. Damage to meis closer to 40%. Very disappointed, not too happy i signed up for amazon prime
 It's taller than what it seems but I have to be inches close to feel the air and it doesn't even blow cool air. My ac wasn't working and I was excited to plug this fan! I was very disappointed that I returned it the following day.
 I used this fan consistently at night for less than a month and the fan just completely stopped working! Everything else works, lights, oscillator but no air from the fan. What a piece of junk, and expensive too! So dissappointed, do not buy this fan!
 Throws out good air, rotates across the room great ventilation, has handle to move and remote control, glad I ordered it.
 This fan does NOT blow as far as it says. I can only fill it if I stand within 5 ft. This would only work for a small room.
 This fan is pretty much useless in the spring/summer time in southern California. The fan on max speed is so low. Such a disappointment. It's basically blowing hot air.
 I bought  this in a store... Best fan it blows out cool... would recommend to buy this fans it works great..
 I’ve had this fan for 8-9 years and used it EVERY night. It still works great.
 Nothing else is even close. This is the fan God uses.
 I like this fan because it is sturdy and tall. I needed a tall fan because my bed is high up. The only thing i do not like is that the blowing power between level 1 and level 2 are pretty much the same, therefore making level 1 louder than it needs to be. If level 1  was noticeably  less powerful than level 2, i would have given it 5 stars. This wasn't a deal breaker for me because i need a little background noise to fall asleep. if you need silence, i would suggest looking at a different fan.
 I bought one of these a few years ago and it worked great, until it died exactly 5 days after the warranty expired. I purchased another similar product by the same company and it too didn't live much more than a month past the warranty date.
 I selected this fan particularly among all the lasko models because of its look. I had a 48" lasko fan before and it brokend down after almost two years. Basically i think it is a good brand.<br/><br/>Upon its arrival, I put it into use right away. Comparing to what i had before, this fan has less wind power. The 1st gear is almost useless. May be it only could be used for over night in bed room. In addtion,  the Rotating angle is very limited, which has only aobut 35 - 40 degree turn. I am not sure if it is only the problem of this particular one or it is the problem for this model.  I am kind of disappointed at it. I will keep test it for another week before I decide if i should get a replacement.
 LOVE LOVE LOVE! It's quiet, smooth. Light weight comes with remote! Instantly made our bedroom cool in 5 min or less!! So amazing!!
 Went from a noisy metal twenty dollar fan to this. I think it is a great investment. It takes up less space, is more quiet, and I love being able to customize the settings and make it rotate.
 This is a gift and was really disappointed when it showed up on my doorstep in an exposed box displaying what it is and bent up and dented.:(
 the oscillating motor on it makes alot more noise than i would expect from a fan, but its lasted for years.  too noisey to sleep with, but great for cooling a room
 Good wind produced, especially if you place it on oscillate right by your bed when you're lying down.  :)  Ion feature is ok so far.  VERY quiet considering the wind output of the fan.<br/><br/>I like it!<br/><br/>Downfall:  A bit fragile, so I can see that maybe it won't last a long time.  Also the wind doesn't project across the room.  It does produce a great breeze from closer in though.
 A little bit noise
 As far as noise I would say it is in the quiet range. On low, which is what we have been primarily using it on, it barely makes a noise. You can "just" hear it on medium and it sounds like a normal fan noise on high. We use it in the living room where the TV and everyone are at, but haven't had to turn the volume up any louder to overcome the sound of the fan like we had to with the Optimus.
 Surprisingly... noisy!  I've purchased tower fans before and they were much quieter... that being said, I agree with other reviewers- it does appear to blow cool air.  I like that it has timer and ionizer functions.  It is a PRETTY fan (the wood panel does NOT look cheap); quite tall.  A good deal overall, I am just disappointed with the noise level.
 I have owned the same one for over 6 years. It is a great fan. Even after my dog chewed the cord. I replaced the plug and still works like a champ. Best fan to have in terms of life. Well worth the money
 This is a great fan, we have owned it for about 2 years and it performs well.  Run it every night, even in winter, my wife loves it.  Has remote too.
 Third Lasco tower fan in 10 years. They last forever. I have mine on 24/7. Very quiet
 I have a great lasko tower, so I stuck with the brand when I needed a second one.<br/><br/>This model is much louder than my existing fan, but doesn't put out more air. It has one small improvement though; the new modified top is much easier to move around.
 All good. Seems to work as expected.
 Great fans! Have had two of these for I think at least 5 or 6 years. Today, on one of our hottest days of the summer the one in our bedroom died. It has 24/7 every summer and most nights the rest of the year because I need the cool. These fans are quite and never disturb our sleep. I was concerned I would not be able to find this exact fan again and was thrilled to find they are on Amazon! I will order two because I need one for my office.
 I just received the fan. It does not blow wind with great speed, for me, it has the same strength as any other fan. Despite this, I gave it four stars because the air really feels fresh.
 I always read the negative reviews, and not just the positive ones I'm a pretty picky buyer and I have to tell you I have found nothing wrong with this fan, in particular it's quite quiet and on low puts out A LOT of air.. The person that complained it doesn't put out enough wind must want to live in a wind tunnel..<br/><br/>Great product, have owned it now for 2 months, use it non-stop in my office.
 Love this fan.  It is whisper quiet, moves a lot of air and it does not take up much floor space.  My neighbor visited, and liked the fan so much, he went home and bought one form Amazon too.
 OK, see the other reviewews for the fact that this fan works, but only for small rooms as it does not blow air far. BUT REMEMBER THAT YOU CANNOT TAKE THIS FAN APART TO CLEAN IT! It sucks lint like any other fan and the interior is unreachable, uncleanable and if you try to clean it--any moisture at all inside and its done. So do not plan to use it more than a year unless you do not mind filthy insides blowing air on you. I live in a dusty area but have a very clean home, (Hawaii), so I'm not a slob. ANY fan gathers lint---just be aware that you cannot clean the filters that spin inside this one! Aloha.
 After waiting 9 days for a 2 day delivery ( it's not the fan's fault). I'm only rating the fan as great and  a great price,thanks.
 Lasko is a no go. Bought 2, Barely used either &amp; here I am looking for more fans, different brand of course.
 OMG, I thought this was going to be an amazing fan, it is after all a Lasko and I have NEVER (until now) been displeased with anything I have purchased with their name on it, but this was A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT and I have it set aside to either sell at a garage sale (and even then I would have to tell the person wanting to buy it, that I would want to plug it in and let them judge for themselves if they are pleased with it), or donate it to charity, although I am not sure if I could do that with a clear conscious, because even if someone got it for free, they would have to pay the electricity to run it and it is not worth it. It is compact and I have one other tower fan by Lasko that is an older model and it works great, although on high, it is a little noisy, but it works great and looks nice, But this one was a waste of money and if I had not already thrown away the box, because I never dreamed a Lasko fan would ever disappoint me and that I would need to return it, I would have sent this back the day after I got it, what a major mistake buying this lemon, I was so excited about getting it, but not pleased AT ALL....I did replace it with a pedestal Lasko fan, an 18 in, that came with a remote and it is great, puts out a LOT OF AIR, and is so quiet. But not so with this purchase what a waste.....
 My son bought this fan and after seeing how well it worked, my mother and I decided to buy one for each of us.  So, there were three fans.  After one year of use, the first broken was mine.  The fan didn't work.  The second fan broken was my mothers' the fan didn't work either.  And the last one with six months of difference was my son's.  My son didn't use it as much as we did so probably that's the reason it lasted more. I did my research and found that the fan has a defect in two resistors that overheat and burn out. Definitively WON'T buy from Lasko again.
 I'm ordering this fan after visiting my family.  I love how quiet and how nice the air feels.
 I had this fan for a little over two years when it gave up the ghost.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Pushes air just fine<br/>Acceptable noise level<br/>Lots of features I don't care about (remote, timer)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Ionizer is a joke - it does nothing (even if it did work, there's no way to clean it)<br/>Broke after only two years - the motor seized up<br/>Difficult to clean<br/>Accumulates dust like nobody's business and deposits it all around the base (far worse than any other fan I've owned)<br/><br/>I can't recommend buying this fan.  For $80, it should last longer - I'm just glad it died in October instead of July!
 After moving to Palm Springs thee years ago, I purchased this fan for my bedroom. It has been running almost non-stop for the last two plus years and still it goes on working. Have to say this little fan has more than earned it's keep and I would recommend for small rooms.
 Bought this fan to cool down the corner my computer is set up in.  Decided on this fan because of reviews stating it was fairly quiet.  It's quite a bit louder than I expected it to be, plus it makes a tapping noise.  But on the other hand, it pushes out quite a bit of air, more than I expected.
 This is a good fan, it works well, the swing is good, the noise is bearable: I am a very light sleeper, and can't sleep when the fan is on high, but low is quiet enough. The ion is great. All in all, it's a great deal.<br/><br/>The reason for 4 stars is that it has a high center of gravity. That makes it difficult/tricky to reach out from the bed and move it a little. I usually keep it about 3 feet from my knees, blowing air over me. And I am sometimes a little picky about the direction of the air flow, and tend to minutely adjust the direction of the flow by leaning out of my bed (I'm just too lazy to put a foot down and reach for the top of the fan), and grabbing the grey part below the vents to slightly adjust the angle of the fan. In the days immediately after I got it, I almost caused the fan to topple a decent number of times, that I am now conditioned to anticipate a fall.
 One of the best fans I've purchased. It works amazing in our living room. Worth every penny and saved me over $75.00 on a fan.
 Purchased this item from Lowe's.  Dead on Arrival out of the box.  Lights come on, oscillates back and forth, but no blow.  Returned for a refund.
 Just got one of these for a basement office space and it is fantastic! Nice and quiet, air is cool and moving around well. Seems sturdy and good quality. We are very pleased!
 I bought one of these about 10 years ago and it still works great.  I am getting ready to purchase another one for my loft.  I have had no problems.  I love the fact that it is a real space saver.
 I've had those fan going on 5 years now. Certain days I will let it run all day while I'm at work and haven't had a single issue with it at all. It's a beast highly recommend it, it doesn't move a whole lot of air but it gets the job done.
 Awesome fans. These have saved my home this summer. Far superior to the Honeywell HY-280 QuietSet tower fan. Some paint did scrape off in shipping.
 This fan has done everything I’ve asked it to and more. On hot ass days it’s provided me with cool ass sheets and blissful sleeps. If I could I would invite this fan to my wedding, it’s that cool.
 Just put this out on the curb. After 2 years of service used only during the hot months of summer the motor stopped working completely.  After cycling through honeywell fans that would last a year or less, I had high hopes the integrity of this fan would be better.  Is it possible to buy a fan that can last longer than a couple of years anymore?  Not happy to send yet another to the crowded landfill.  I cannot see buying another with such a limited life.
 Good choice--no complaints here. Everything is just as shown and described. Quiet and works welll--love the remote! Works throughout large living room. Very happy wjith purchase
 S. Mann's comment about being able to run it next to the TV without increasing volume was the deciding factor in my buying this fan.  It's SO quiet! The timer, it's beauty (you laugh, but this fan is pretty ... as another reviewer said, the faux wood is NOT cheesy), and small footprint are all good. There's a slot in back to store the remote control AND a built-in handle near the top, so to carry the fan from room to room is balanced and easy.  I find myself lugging it from TV room to kitchen to bedroom.<br/><br/>You can louver the air to blow up or down. It moves air well.  I use a lot less AC, now that I got this fan.  My rooms are small (10x12 max) with normal ceilings.<br/><br/>Ionizer feature. When it's on, a BRIGHT blue light is also on. Special, but unless you're a teenager, you'll want to tape a wad of tissue over it, if this fan's in your bedroom. I read up on what the ionizer does, and best I could deduce, it blows out particles which attach like magnets to (dust, mold, pet) airborne particles and they fall to the floor (so as not to be breathed in).  I sleep in the basement (musty) and have a cat, and did not notice the air feeling/smelling any fresher using the ionizer. Take this report with a grain of salt, since I don't really know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Negatives:  In the 6 months I've owned the fan, the only complaint is when it oscillates, a small click occurs. If in a room with conversations going on, you wont notice it.<br/><br/>If you are frail or wobbly, the bulk of the fan might be too much. I was thinking to get one for some elderly relatives, but just I know they'd try and lug it from room to room, and eventually I think it'd cause them to trip, drop it, or fall.<br/><br/>Packing/shipping: I appreciated reading another review that mentioned how the fan is shipped: right in it's box. NO packing or wrapping material. The shipping label is slapped right on the box, and any bumps or dings occur on (your nice storage box). There's appropriate foam blocks inside, protecting the fan. Just be aware, this is how a lot of things are shipped these days. (I'll be extra cautious to not have medical or sexual aids shipped to the workplace!)<br/><br/>If I had more storage space, I'd buy one of these fans for upstairs and another for downstairs.
 Makes a humming noise, not a "fan" noise which I do not like so that makes me not a fan of this fan.
 Use every single day. Awesome fan!
 If you're looking for an affordable fan that works well, this Lasko 2551 wind curve platinum tower fan might work on you too.
 I've had this fan for years. It has never let me down. Cools larges rooms very well, quiet yet still adds the little bit of white noise I need to sleep. Looks great and fits into any spot. The height is perfect too. I have a tall bed and it blows completely onto me when in bed. For the price I wouldn't purchase any other fan.
 This fan just plain works well, helped tremendously during the recent heat wave.  It's quiet enough for me to sleep near too.
 I LOVE this fan! I was afraid at first because some of the negative reviews, but it really works well! Not loud at all! It projects a lot of air and keeps my room a lot cooler than my past fan. Very happy with this fan, I would buy from this company again!
 This fan is a loud piece of cheap plastic crap...and I can't get a return on it !
 Wow.....great prodcut... it's a shame we can't make these here in the good old U.S.A......no complaints.....save on AC bill $$$$$
 I've had this unity for a short period of time. After using it for 30 minutes to an hour is starts releasing a terrible odor. Bought this unit because of the stellar reviews. Very disappointed.
 I've had it for 2 years and still going strong!
 The fan does what it says on the box. It looks good and as said before the rotation is EXTREMELY quiet. I think it is lacking in settings. The lowest fan setting is surprisingly intense and it only has 3 speed settings. Maybe if it were in a large room or house it would be great, but in my small apartment it's a bit much.
 Great working fan. It's tall, cool enough, oscillation &amp; timer work great as well. BUT, we were shipped a fan without screws. Rating 3 stars because of the hassle it took to go out of my way to buy screws.
 I'm a fan of this fan!  I liked the first one so much, I just had another one delivered!  Nice output with very little noise and with an air cleaner, oscillation and a timer to boot!
 This fan from Lasko has currently lasted me several years. I live in the desert, and during the summer setting this fan near my bed has helped lower my electricity costs and allowed me to turn the air conditioning off.  It runs very quietly (I am a light sleeper, and I keep this on my side of the bed).  Have had no problem, excellent product, and will buy this brand in the future should I need to.
 Great...makes no sound, excellent air circulation.
 we bought this fan to replace our one that broke, of course in winter so fan in a store are out of season -.-, we only use it in our bed room but even on the low setting it pushes air good. it is super quiet, and even when in oscillation mode it is quiet, our past 2 fans have make a clicking noise. the only reason i'm giving 3 stars and not more is it only came with 2 small screws for the base, the screws only fit to make the 2 bottoms pieces one piece we had to find screws to fit to attach it to the fan, so you need like 2-4 screws to put it together
 There are some days when the temperature isn't high enough to run your air conditioner. So I decided to buy this Lasko fan. Must say, this fan not only looks great, but also circulates air well. But the best part is, I now use my air conditioner only during peak summer days and this fan has helped cut my electricity bill drastically. My parents bought one for the living room too. This fan looks great if you have wooden walls and/or floors. Highly recommend this product.
 Dust magnet very hard to clean without opening up the back panel and it is not recommended that you do so
 Thanks to previous reviews, I chose this fan.  Very happy with it.  Looks great, is pretty quiet and does the job.
 This review isn't for this fan specifically as i'm sure they no longer make the fan I have since it was purchased in 2006, but as a company these guys are awesome their fans are champs, I can't tell you how many times my fan has been knocked over in the 9 years i've had it, not to mention having been transported to the 3 different places i've lived since i've had it...
 The fan worked great for about 2-3 weeks, but the buttons no longer work. I have to rely on using the remote to switch it on.
 Good price good product
 Quiet and does the job. Puts out a nice breeze and moves from side to side. Cord a little short, but overall very happy with it. Quick ship
 I clearly got a fan that somebody had returned, it did not come with a remote or screws to assemble, disappointed
 Awesome fan! VERY powerful! Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it's a bit noisy at night if you're a light sleeper even on level 1! Was a little disappointed because my other LASKO fan I own is extremely quiet. Other then that it does the job!
 They work perfect for air movement in my tent
 We loved it so much, we bought another one.
 I have had this fan since Summer of 2015 and I have had no problems so far! I love that it comes with a controller and has 3 different fan speeds. It gets my room cool and that is all I ask of it. I recommend this fan to anyone
 Nice quiet fan; however, the one I received does not come with a storage compartment for the remote.
 This is the my 2nd one, the fan always blows cold air. Believe or not when this fan is on its never had to turn on my AC. The air is as good as AC. Highly recommend!
 Tall sleek design, but bulky and not as quiet as other fans. Would not buy this again.
 A very quiet and powerful fan.  It did a great job in my office.
 The product works fine and at first it was pretty quiet but then when we put it on at night while we're sleeping you notice it makes some clicking sounds every once in a while.  Other than that it has 3 different speeds, can be used as an ionizer (but I can't tell the difference), oscillates and has a timer control.  Over all I'd say it's a great product for the amount of money I paid.  It's also pretty tall which is nice and has a remote control.
 This is a great fan; puts out cold air, quiet, and sturdy! Even on the #1 setting, the room cools down considerably within 10 minutes. Easy to use. Highly recommend!
 If you want quiet ok, but this has the lamest wind speed.  I put between my kitchen and dining room and it almost not worth turning on.  However, if it was a small area and you want quiet, this would be fine.  I would not buy this product again.
 Based On Actual Events<br/><br/>It was the summer of 14'. Where all body heat would rule all. 2 big guys sharing a 10x10 office with a non-working ceiling fan. We were the proverbial cat on the hot tin roof. We wanted to get out but had to stay in. Our lives looked bleak with the air filled with methane. We could see the light at the end of the tunnel. Then one of us says<br/><br/>"You can almost see the heat waves"<br/>"I know, my only regret is I didn't see enough boobs"<br/>"...agreed"<br/><br/>In our last moments we would cling to the past of the good times where winter was an option for us to survive and love this incredible thing we call life. We felt as if this angel was pulling us in closer and closer to the edge. Then we were saved by the good people of amazon for sending the Lasko 2551 Wind Curve Platinum Tower Fan With Remote Control and Fresh Air Ionizer. We could feel the cool air rushing to wipe the sweat from our big bodies. And alas comes the end to our tale of survival of the Meat Sweat of 14'. We live today to tell everyone of how this fan saved our lives and how it can possibly save yours.
 Okay fan, very attractive. Bought to help cool off the house during hot Texas summers. Works well in a smaller room like the bedroom.  Kind of loud and makes a click after a few weeks in oscillating mode. I don't know that I'd pay $60 for it again but pretty happy with it. If your looking for an attractive average fan with remote it will work.
 I bought this for my husband because he is always really hot in the summertime, and he LOVES it. It oscillates so we can keep the entire living room cool, or just focus the entire thing on him. Would buy again.
 This fan stopped working about 1 year after we purchased it. We barely used it for 6 of those months.<br/>I've had $30 fans last longer.
 Excellent fan for the price! It has been hot and when resting or watching tv I don't have to turn on the a/c. I am sure it will save me lots of $$$$ this summer!
 a bit too noisy for me. sometimes gets me awake at night. i had to buy sleeping pills because I did not want to return this
 Get 5 stars. Luv them. Bought 2
 We purchased this fan for an elderly relative several years ago. After using the fan for a few weeks, she said the fan was no longer working and smelled like it was burning.<br/>I looked inside and two resistors on the control circuit board with the buttons had overheated, burning the board and melting a hole through the plastic case around the board.<br/><br/>We returned the fan to Lasko and received a new fan under warranty. That fan lasted longer, until it was taken out of storage this year and would not turn on. Looking inside, it had the same problem as before, the same resistors overheated, melting a capacitor located above the resistors.<br/><br/>Just another example of low quality Chinese products that can't be fixed when they break, and in this case may be a fire hazard.
 Literally worth every penny. I live upstairs so all the heat is trapped in my room. This fan makes it so I can finally sleep at night. 100% worth it and the remote is just a bonus.
 Incredible product.  I bought the Dyson Air Multiplier AM07 first and returned it because it was actually kind of loud and didn't really move the air too well, especially for more than $300.  This fan is quieter and moves the air better.  I love it.
 Bought this through home depot in case there was a problem I could return it. Fan is great Feels like air conditioning. Strongest of wind come from unit. My family loves it. Not going to be sent back!
 Very quiet. Love it and going to buy a second one for the bedroom.
 I don't use it, but that is not why I purchased this fan anyway. The main reason I chose this fan over other tower fans was for looks. I love the wood on the front, and it looks very pleasing to the eye, unlike most fans. I think one of the worst parts of this fan, unlike previous reviews, is the noise.
 I got a defective model. I have to press the ON button about 10 times to turn it on. Then, it doesn’t turn off. I have to unplug it to turn it off. Then, when I want to use it again I have to press ON button 10-20 times for it to turn on. Ugh returning it. Waste of my time.
 I recently purchased this fan and immediately sent it back which is something I never bother with doing. It only oscillates maybe 30 degrees and you can't feel the air from 3 feet away! I went with the Honeywell version and I am MUCH happier with it and it was less expensive. If you're going to be sitting right in front of this fan and don't need the oscillation feature, it will be fine for you. Otherwise...don't waste your money!
 The fan is being used in a small bedroom on the lowest setting and is perfect for the space. It is quiet and does not keep me awake at night. I am planning on buying another.
 This lasko fan is placed behind the wood burning stove in our home to push the warm air around the room.  After 6-7 years of service of it is finally going out. This is a sad day for my wife and I. Im just happy that amazon has them in stock.
 As expected.
 So far so good! Just arrived today, very easy to assemble. Looks great and works perfect!
 Works perfectly
 This is an awesome product. Good Air flow, less noisy, good rotation and strong base. My use of air condition has reduced significantly due to this fan. I would highly recommend this product.
 I Love it and it's just right for me and I don't require a whole lot of cold cold air so this perfect.
 was a 5star fan (lol) until it started making a ridiculous ticking/humming noise two months into owning it. threw it out.
 Product is as described. Very efficient, just not too sure about its cooling power, otherwise a good buy
 very happy. I will buy another one in the near future
 Our office had this fan for about a month and we only had great responds from everyone.
 I bought this Fan from a big box retailer after reading some of the reviews. I really liked the fan since it was quiet and effective. Unfortunately it stopped working 2 days back which kind of bummed me out. I expected the fan to last atleast a couple more years. So I am off to buy a new fan, but definitely not Lasko !!
 This fan emits a shrill beep when you plug it in, again when you turn on the power button, each time you make any adjustments to the other settings, and yes, even when you turn it off. I dread pushing any buttons due to the annoying noise, and feel that my hearing will go down a couple of decibels if I had to hear this noise everyday. I have resorted to pulling the plug to turn it off.  Great fan otherwise.
 good investment
 I love the tower fan.  Looked at a lot of them befor I purchased this one. I like the looks of it as well as the operation and air it puts out.<br/>Good value for the money.
 Cool and quiet
 This fan moves A LOT of air and cools down any room in a fairly short amount of time. The remote worked fine for me so I'm not sure what other reviewers are talking about. My first order was lost in the mail but Amazon sent me a new fan via 1 day shipping at no cost to me!
 I purchased this fan yesterday and the 6 screws i got only 4 fit, the two for the base DO NOT FIT !!!
 Had a fan just like this that lasted 8 years with no problems the entire time. That's why I bought the same one when it finally gave out. This one is slightly larger, but seems to work just as well. I love these fans!
 Am unable to use the fan as it arrived without hardware (screws to attach the base) as many have reported. Will be calling today.
 I am completing this review on behalf of my boss, Bob Miles.  I ordered and he has told me numberous times how happy he is with it.  It generates a lot of air without wind and cools his entire office.  It is pretty quiet and he loves the remote and timer feature.  Thank you.
 I love this product!  I have actually bought 6 of these Wind Curve fans in recent months.  The design is pleasing.  It doesn't take up much space, operates very quietly, oscillates, ionizes the air, and has a remote control.  What is not to like?
 the summer is even better with this fan in ur room
 Great fan. A little louder than expect, but I great fan nonetheless.
 I ordered the fan for my mom during a recent heat wave, after realizing all the local stores werre sold out. I should have checked Amazon first. It arrived promptly, was easy to set up, and works beautifully. And she lloves  the remote!
 Was great when working. I had it in one place the entire time of use and fan stopped working after about a year.  Electronics still worked, but motor apparently failed, very poor quality for something so simple as a basic fan motor.
 I bought this item before Thanksgiving. I was happy with the shipping. So far I've been enjoying this fan. The features are great and it's practically soundless compare to other fans I've seen. I like the look. I just hope it keeps working for more than a year. Is that too much?:)
 This fan was a big mistake. The screeching noise is unbearable when it oscillates. To make matters worse, the fan's blades are tiny and it barely produces air. Can't use it at night as the noise is too loud, but even if the oscillating is turned off, it does nothing to cool down an area of heat even if pointing right at it. A poor excuse for a fan.
 just what I needed
 Great fan! Works great.
 Have had this fan for 4 years and is blowing on me right now, very satisfied sleep with it on all night and is great fan!
 Runs quiet and good for the price!
 After trying three other fans I finally found THE one!  This fan is just about soundless......I was amazed.  I love it! Throws a lot of air. Remote works perfectly and no noise!
 works well
 I love all the features but the two top are the remote and the timer which will turn it off in 30 min or 7  hours. I love it!!!!
 Very reasonable priced, works well, puts out a lot of cool air. Like the remote feature. Was much more than I bargained for; we are so glad we purchased it from Amazon as the shipping was very reasonable.
 Excellent and was a gift!  This thing is amazing, feels like air condition in bedroom.  I have an AC but this machine is amazing.
 I purchased (2) Lasko fans about three months ago and it was NOT what I expected by reading the reviews. As stated no loud noises but it didn't really blow out an air either.<br/><br/>Was a total waste of my time and money to purchase.  The only positive was it shipped to a P.O. BOX address (work overseas) and I received my pkgs rapidly.<br/><br/>Had I been stateside I would have purchased different fans for comparison.
 I purchased this fan two summers ago (2008).  We used it for about three month.  That summer wasn't too hot so we used it minimally in conjunction with our AC.  It sat idle for the winter.  The following summer we tried to use it again and we had a horrible time with it.  The fan and motors seemed to work fine, but the electrical functions of the fan seemed to work intermittently.  Sometimes the power button would work, sometimes it wouldn't.  Same issue with the rest of the button controls.  The attached remote did not help either.  It seemed to be a loose connection inside the fan that would totally keep the fan from working.  Sometimes, if you tapped it on the side or picked it up and moved it, it would start working.  This just became such an annoyance we stopped using the fan.  I definitely would NOT recommend this fan.  Move on...
 Works very well and is fairly quiet. Has been a Godsend during this hot summer.
 Works well for its purpose, easy to assemble
 We were happy with this fan last summer, we didn't need to use this since last September and we need this again now. This fan, however, just doesn't function anymore. Completely broken. We kind of noticed signs of mulfunctioning last year, now it's broken. We didn't expect that we have to buy a new one this year; of couse, I'm not gonna buy this one.
 Using it for 6 months so far no complaints
 I followed the cleaning/vaccumming instructions the first 2 summers. Filth/odor built up on fan. So,  either throw away or remove the 20-24 screws and take 3 1/2 -5 hours to clean it.  I have owned 3 other ion fans that had an easily removeable cleanable fan/filter component that takes  a few minutes to clean and 5-10 minutes to air dry before replacing...I suggest you eyeball any tower you're thinking of buying to check out the ease of cleaning.
 Very disappointed.......  only lasted 2 months!
 the light on the front is incredibly bright for use in a dark bedroom, but a bit of tape fixes that.
 This fan works perfectly for the bedroom!  It creates just enough air to keep it comfortable, quiet operation, and the timer on the remote is a great convience!
 I really liked this fan. It worked great. Suddenly, with no advanced warning, it wouldn't turn on. I have 2 other fans that I have been using for 10 years and are still going with no problems. I expected this to last for more than 2 years! I will not be buying any more Lasko products!
 Great looking and great working tower fan.
 Sleep beautiful the night No sweat enjoy the cool breeze Even my dog enjoy the cool breeze Sleep with his legs open
 worked for a very long time with no issue. but gave out a couple of weeks ago. very happy with the performance all in all
 I am a huge advocate of saving electricity which is why I bought the fan.  I like to sleep in cool temperatures and living in the deep south only allows that luxury with the AC cranked and running all night.  The fan does a GREAT job of pushing air and I now sleep with my AC 7 degrees higher than I used to saving a bundle on my power bill.  (It costs less to power the fan than it does the HVAC system) If everyone turned up their HVAC system by 2 degrees(in summer - down 2 in winter) it could help to lessen the effects of Global Warming greatly.  Mission Accomplished.  The fan is sleek, powerful, the remote is handy, its inexpensive, and quiet!  Great Buy!
 Excellent fan. Loving it.
 Used fan in a small 1 bedroom apartment to help with the AC cooling. Fan stopped working without warning within a year of purchase. Home Depot indicated they "have had a lot of problems with this particular model". Was a great fan while it lasted which wasn't long. Customer service at Lasko pretty inept. Will look at another manufacturer for next fan.
 Only one word :  Magnificent
 i thought the plastic and faux wood might look cheesy but it really was the classiest option at this price.  looks nice, efficient, small footprint.  remote a nice feature (though i got called out during a conference for playing with it).
 Very happy with the product.
 Lasko did it right , this fan is able to cool down our bottom floor of our two story house. It is quiet and moves air quite well . It is form and function .. Defently well worth it....
 It's so beautiful, it's like a piece of furniture...and does a great job cooling.  Highly recommend.
 This is a great fan I run it 24-7 and I never have problems with it and it also looks koo.
 I bought this fan today at Walmart (for $47.94).  I needed something to cool my medium size office (18'x18').<br/><br/>The fan was easy to put together.  I placed it across the room from my desk and within five minutes temperature had noticeably dropped.<br/><br/>The remote control is great and the timer feature means I don't have to remember to turn it off before I leave each day.

A LOUD HUM noise is all I hear. It is unbearable  Returning it later tonight. Here is a vid zoomed in or w/e.
 this fan works really well for a year. It stopped working about a week after the warranty expired. It's a shame because otherwise, it's a pretty effective product.
 Lasko makes a MUCH more powerful fan that costs less.  Look up Lasko #4930 High Velocity Fan.  It's infinitely better.
 I just wanna say that it's cool.
 I purchased this fan about 6 months ago within the first month it stopped oscillating it has very poor wind movement it also collects massive amount of dust and there  is no way to clean it without completely taking it apart
 I have never purchased a tower fan before so I have nothing to compare to, but I would say this is a good fan, not great, but good. It does move a ton of air. Maybe even too much, I don't put it on a higher speed than 1 because the 2nd and 3rd speed is very strong and blows papers and other things all around the room. The ionizer I use very little. It gives me a headache, and I have heard nothing but negaitive things about ionizers so I don't use it, but that is not why I purchased this fan anyway. The main reason I chose this fan over other tower fans was for looks. I love the wood on the front, and it looks very pleasing to the eye, unlike most fans. I think one of the worst parts of this fan, unlike previous reviews, is the noise. The fan itself makes little noise but the air it pushes around makes a lot of noise, even at low speeds. It is not something terrible, and can sometimes be relaxing, almost like the sound of a constant breeze or wind, but can sometimes get distracting/annoying Overall I would recommend this fan to anyone who wants to buy a fan with ionizer and great looks. If the ionizer and looks aren't important to you I might go with a cheeper fan.
 I liked the looks of this fan, read the other reviews and decided to try it. The fan is not noisy at all which is what I wanted because I watch TV in the room it is in. But I also wanted it to cool the room quickly. The ionizer is plus because it also takes care of the smells from the kitchen that carry into this room. The remote is a plus! Easy to assemble, easy to use, has a remote, is quite, and helps with odors.
 Tower fan is very nice, works wonderfully, and adds to a room's decor without standing out too much! Shipping was on time and I am very pleased with purchase...just what i was looking for!
 I have had my fan for two years.  Quiet and puts out lot of air.  Use it in my living room on the first setting most of time.
 Less than a month has past since getting this fan and the oscillate has already stopped working.
 I bought this fan mainly due to the positive reviews here.  However, I decided to return the fan for refund on the very first day it arrived because it doesn't push as much air as it was claimed by other reviewers here.  I like its look but a fan must at least achieve its primary objective which is to cool the room; I don't think this fan achieves this objective at all.
 Bought one at a local wal mart and walked up to it to shut it off and the static electricity from the carpet charged me up and when I touched the control pad it sent a charge into it from me and the control pad quit working ....Couldnt turn it on or off so take my advice if you have it in a carpeted room use the remote because the manufacturer will NOT replace the fan !!!!!
 This one is a bit noisy but works great. So far no problems
 Each time I've bought one someone else in the office has asked for one.  We now have three and love them.
 not to sure about this fan.  it worked well for about 4 months and then it started making this fast rattling/clicking sound.  i've tried various things to stop it but nothing really works.  i think i'm going to have to take it apart and find out what's causing this.  what a pain!  makes it very hard to sleep at night.<br/><br/>an interesting side note: a few years back i owned a different model LASKO fan.  although i don't have it anymore, i kept the remote.  as a test, i tried the old remote with the current fan.  sure enough it worked, but what i found interesting is that the old remote had a "breeze" button which would repeatedly alternate the speed, slow, fast, slow fast...  i tried it out on my new fan and it worked!  i wonder why this feature wasn't included on the remote for this fan?
 Beware of the flattering reviews on this fan. My wife bought this for my office as the wood veneer was supposed to match my furniture. The fan is cheap with plastic everywhere. It is flimsy has rattle when moving.  The air fan makes a lot of noise but you can't feel anything unless standing 3 feet in front of it. Would not recommend this fan if it were free. Spend the money and get something that works from  some one else but avoid these cheap Lasko fans
 After about 7 months, the entire internal housing (the vertical fan itself) collapsed inside the unit. I took it apart (NOT a fun job) and tried to fix it. The unit was dead.<br/><br/>It all started, like others here have said, after it started making noise one month prior. After investigation, it appears it was a cheap Made-in-China part that holds the entire fan atop the mechanism/moter, and it just gave out. Another Chinese conspiracy to make products that go bad within the year so we will obviously go buy another one.
 Garbage.  Complete and total garbage.  Rattles and grinds.
 This fan was awesome while it lasted. It worked for about a year and a half, and for no reason (that I can figure out atleast), the fan stopped working. The oscillating function still works fine though...<br/><br/>I will be buying a different brand next time.
 this product so far is working amazing, no odd noises, actually no noise at all, incredibly silent, plus it moves a great deal of air.  remote is responsive and fits well into the compartment in the back.  this product is very sturdy as well.  so far i recommend this product, to all looking for a good tower fan. but i hope to write a review down the rode when my family and i have used it for a few months.<br/>update-its been some time and my family and i are fairly impressed with this product, it still is incredibly silent and is running strong i am very impressed with my purchase
 Love it!!
 barely moves air.  i put it next to my pc desk. i am 3 feet away and cant feel anything. worthless fan. my 20 year old tiny fan is better.
 This is the first time I am creating a review eventhough I have been a regular shopper on amazon for many years..The reason for my review is to underline that a broken item can be DANGEROUS!<br/><br/>here's my story:<br/><br/>after studying customers' reviews and advices, I ordered 2 tower fans by Lasko with 1 day delivery.<br/><br/>the first one - 42 inch wind curve tower fan by Lasko was delivered today in a terrible old factory package by Lasko.<br/><br/>1- There was a huge hole in the upper middle part of the box.<br/>2- The item was not placed inside the amazon's standard package.<br/>3- I immediately knew that an air tower fan can not survive such a terrible weak packaging with a big hole on it through which I could already see the front of the fan before opening the package<br/><br/>I tried to be optimist and assembled the fan.<br/>It was not solid but rather sturdy after assembly.<br/>Then I switched the power on..<br/>Oh My God!<br/>the tower fan's inside components were FREE-ROTATING with a very scary loud sound.<br/>The tower was shaking! It looked like it was about to dismantle into pieces and that screeching whirling part inside was hitting to the interiour walls of the fan very violently!!<br/><br/>I was SHOCKED- TERRIFIED and very SCARED!<br/>I moved away from it immediately and switched the power off and unplugged it.<br/><br/>now I asked for a refund and waiting for the UPS to come to pick it up<br/>after re-packing the fan, my conscience forced me to stick a big paper on the box with a red marker which read ' it is dangerous to switch this broken fan on '.<br/><br/>the other tower fan which I ordered (model again by Lasko company) will be delivered tomorrow<br/><br/>I really hope that my terrible experience from today wont repeat itself..
 I avoid all Lasko brands.  I have had three of their products fail within 3 months of use on each item.  One ground gears when oscillating, one stopped working completely and the other became the noisiest fan I even owned before giving up.  Your money is better spent on a brand like Honeywell.
 it does not circulate the air at all, just rotates a very small space, we have been trying to contact you to send it back, but the hold time is way to long.
 eTotal lack of amperage or watts used. (Thought this was illegal)
 I found that I did not need the product and tried to contact the vendor. The box was unopened. Never heard from them.
 Your product was broke when it was received..The inside rattles like it wasn't put together correct  I had to go to a Brick and Mortar store to buy one that works.<br/>I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!
 The box was missing the screws to put the fan together and stuff is made from cheap plastic.<br/><br/>not recommended.
 Oh man, this thing is awesome, I may never use the AC again. I sleep in the day and have an issue with afternoon sun turning my room into an oven, this fan has brought me so much relief, it's perfect for cooling down the room so I can snooze before being up all night.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-RSII8D6BIJDAH"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B17c+jJq5WS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jFNs+qPQS.png"/> This is really quiet. It’s not silent, but it has a small hum to it. Good white noise for sleeping. I believe the loud ones are defective. It doesn’t blow very hard, like others. It comes with a remote and a handy hook for it at the back. Batteries not included, takes two AAA batteries. Overall it’s good and I’d buy it again.
 Menopausal hot flashes and 106 summer temps. prompted this buy.  I have central A/C but this provides the kind of air movement I needed without blowing all the house dust around.  I love the Ionizer  -  it makes the air feel cooler.<br/>It is large but it fits better in a corner than your usual round fan. I'd love it if it looked more vintage in some way - I generally hate appliances - but house vanity goes on the back burner when you are HOT!<br/><br/>After a couple of months I am buying a second one so I don't have to move it around the house (although it is not too heavy and I can usually move it with one hand to lift and one to steady it).<br/><br/>I don't use the remote so can't comment on that.
 Wow!<br/><br/>Bought this because we live in an old building and we have a window unit in the living room, our room is on the far side of the complete opposite side of the apartment.<br/><br/>We did not want to obstruct any more window views, so we did not want another window unit A/C.<br/><br/> We certainly did not want a portable AC...those things are gastly, loud, and obnoxious.<br/><br/>THIS fan here is quiet, doesn’t take up a lot of room and it does wonders for our bedroom…lets me sleep through the night in peace.<br/><br/>The ionizer is a plus.<br/><br/>The fan has a timer mode, oscillator mode, ionizer and speed setting. All of which can be controlled through the remote control, which is small and has a storage area on the fan itself.<br/><br/>Love it!
 This is going to be a pretty through review.<br/><br/>To start off, I will go over assembly and packing. Following that, I will review the fan and its controls, air flow, the ion feature and other specs.<br/><br/>Assembly and packing:<br/>The fan came in a tall box that contained the fan, two base pieces, and 3 bags. One contained the manual, the other contained 4 screws that can be tightened by hand, and the third contained a remote. Once you remove the fan from the box, you will clip the two base pieces together. The base then screws into the bottom of the fan using the four screws that can be tightened with your hand. No tools required.<br/><br/>Fan controls and air movement:<br/>The fan has 5 buttons. A power button, a swivel button, an ion button, a timer button, and a fan speed button. The buttons do not beep when they are pressed. The fan moves a good amount of air and is extremely quiet. I sit about 20 feet away from the fan and feel a good steady breeze. The timer is like majority of other fans on the market. It has a 1/2, 1, 2, and 4 hour setting with the option to combine times. It also has 3 fan settings; low, medium and high.<br/><br/>Now for my only disappointment. Lasko advertises this fan as having an ion feature. Upon inspection, I do not see any metal plates that would be used by the ion feature. Furthermore, I have a high sensitivity voltage meter and there is absolutely no difference while the fan is on normal or with the ion feature on. This is in wattage and amperage. I am not convinced this is even a feature on the fan, rather just a light and a selling point.<br/><br/>Here are some more detailed specs of the fan:<br/><br/>While fan is on high:<br/>.45 amp<br/>55 watt<br/>56 va<br/>60 Hz<br/>.12 KWh<br/><br/>Fan on medium:<br/>.40 amp<br/>46 watt<br/>50 va<br/>60 Hz<br/><br/>Fan on low:<br/>.38 amp<br/>42 watt<br/>48 va<br/>60 Hz
 It was super easy to put together and I had it plugged into the wall in 10 minutes.  I LOVE how quiet it is!  This blows air at low speed can blow 10-15 feet across a room no problem.  The remote is a blessing, I can be a lazy bum, turning it cooler or off.  Highly recommended
 We have only had the fan 2 days so far, but it’s AWESOME! I will definitely do a durability update in 2-3 months and if anything goes wrong, but so far this fan is perfect! Very impressed with the design and power, has 3 fan speeds, oscillation, ionization and timer functions. Aesthetically pleasing, the wood paneling makes it look more expensive. Very easy assembly, just put the base together and it snaps/locks in place. Very impressed with the oscillation, it rotates about 180 degrees to get the full room. Almost purchased the similar looking Honeywell model in White that is a little less expensive, but when I did the math the 4 &amp; 5 star reviews on the Honeywell accounted for about 75% of the reviews, but for this one they make up closer to 90%, and more of them were 5 than 4. Not as many stated that this one konked out after a few months as they did on the other one, and there were several reviewers on the Honeywell that mentioned problems with the base breaking. Those were all reasons I went with this one and I’m really glad because the base is much sturdier and differently designed, we have a cat so the sturdiness was important to me. We have another Lasko brand regular fan that we have had for over a year now in an un-air conditioned apartment in Long Beach CA that has pretty much been turned on 24/7 since we bought it and it has never slowed down or had any problems so I’m hopeful that this fancier model will be as reliable. Could not believe the difference in cooling power from this tower model compared to our regular standing one...my fiancé said it was like sleeping in a calming meadow, haha. Super quiet, too.
 It's the first tower fan I've purchased, so I cannot compare to any others.  Why it works for me... we have an open floor plan and the breeze can be felt from one end to the other, approx 65 feet.  The height is nice when working in the kitchen.  The fan was purchased to use on the top floor, but it is actually too big for the smaller rooms upstairs and this size fan is more appropriate for very large spaces.  It is bulky to more from floor to floor.<br/><br/>It do believe it will scratch the wood floor, when someone came to clean there was a large half circle scratch like it was dragged to clean around it, but  I always lift and do not drag.<br/><br/>It's not super-quiet, imo, but I don't have another tower fan to compare it too.  Louds sounds do bother me and I've never turned this off because I found it bothersome.
 I bought 4 of these because our windows will not allow a/c units. Was a bit skeptical about how cold these would blow. 100% impressed. The air coming out is as cold as an a/c unit. Now I will not have a hot home come summer and that equals less anxiety since heat is a trigger for me! Best purchase!
 To the point, I might still recommend this fan for the price.  It has quite a good stream of air it's able to push out, though it's very direct.  Even at a distance, needs to be pointed exactly at the person (with the fins manually adjusted almost all the way down, interestingly enough, if it's at a direct angle and you're in a seated position).<br/><br/>The problem for me with any fan is mostly noise.  I called the company in and this seemed to be the better choice when it came to their fan options (in that respect).  As suggested in the headline, the issue isn't just the loudness of the fan which respect to actual fan/wind noise; the motor at the base creates a subtle (to the untrained ear) buy VERY otherwise noticeable pitch, heard at any distance.  To get a sense, go to onlinetonegenerator.com, select the "Triangle" wave, and type in 120 Hz.  I would say it's a mixture of 120 and 241 Hz - maybe a bit less sharp sounding than a triangle wave (like between a triangle and a basic sine wave).  In terms of loudness, it's relative, so it's hard to say, but for some sense, basically it's in equal proportions loud as the fan noise on the lowest setting (which again, isn't loud, but still very noticeable).  Let's put it this way, I can still hear the fan above my TV set louder than I would typically otherwise have it (with the fan at over 12 ft away and the TV at an equal distance in the other direction).<br/><br/>At first I actually thought it was the plastic possibly vibrating (the sound itself sounds cheap in this way and the whole thing is essentially plastic), not helped by that in fact IT DOES make some sort of vibrating noise while oscillating (moving back and forth) every time it starts turning the other way.  That's unacceptable in my view.  In my case it's actually okay, as I only use it to rotate it in the direction I'm currently positioned.<br/><br/>Final two points, it is (imo) aesthetically pleasing, and then with respect to the ionizer, I couldn't exactly comment.  I would just have to assume it works (would otherwise need to be scientifically tested in like a controlled environment).
 I have a very similar (older model) fan like this in my bedroom that I love.  I finally broke down and bought one to have downstairs as well.<br/><br/>I love this fan because...<br/>- it is tall and thin so it doesn't take up a lot of space<br/>- it has 3 speeds as well as a timer if you want it to shut off automatically<br/>- it oscillates left to right (not up and down - but you can manually change the direction of air flow to be higher or lower)<br/>- it is quiet (although I enjoy the sound of a fan)<br/>- it is a nice gray color so it blends better than a white or black fan would.  It isn't too shiny<br/><br/>While it has a remote - I have not used it because I have so many other remotes I can't handle anymore! And getting up to turn it on or off is not that difficult.<br/><br/>The one in my bedroom is at least 3 years old now and still going strong.
 The first fan I got the remote did not work since I specifically was needing a fan with a remote i was pretty bummed. The box was badly damaged that it came in so I have a feeling it was not treated well in shipping and that is probably why the remote did not work. The remote was not protected by foam like the fan was. Its taped to the outside of the fan in a baggie. So I can see if the box were knocked around so would the remote. So Lasko needs to work on the packaging.<br/><br/>I contacted Amazon and they wanted me to mail back the fan unfortunately there was no way that was gonna happen the Original box was barely a box any more and I cant even imagine all the duct tape in the house would have kept it together. Frankly this is not exactly an easy size box to find. It is as tall as a 6 year old child. Amazon was awesome about it and sent me another fan since they couldn't just send me a new remote. Luckily the 2nd fan remote works perfectly. I have an extra fan now which i will probably donate to habitat for humanity.<br/><br/>Thanks Amazon for not making me try to make a box to ship this beast back in.<br/><br/>The fan it self is perfect. It is very quiet.  You do hear it but its not really noticeable except on the highest setting. Its winter now so not really using it much of course but I am in the south so its not uncommon to have some warmer days here and there. My bedroom seems to stay a little warmer than other rooms in the house so I like to be able to cool things off when I need to. The controls are very easy to figure out pretty standard for most fans. The remote works from across the room which is exactly what I was looking for.<br/><br/>I'm giving it 5 stars because it does work but if Amazon has not stepped up and solved the broken remote problem quickly and efficiently it would have gotten a much less score of course. I think this really is a packaging issue more than anything.
 I bought it to cool down my bedroom during sleep time and not have to run the central air all night and make my electric bill go sky high during the hot summer months on So. Cal.  I set this up in no time.  It's easy to just screw on the base.  All you need is a proper screwdriver and about 5 minutes.  I plugged it in after placing it by my bed, turned it on and got familiar with the settings, and then let it do its thing and it performs beautifully.  I keep the handy remote on my beside table.  The fan has three speeds, it can oscillate or stay in one position and the air coming from it is plenty cool.  This is just a GREAT FAN.  I'm considering buying another one for another room.  I find that I don't have to run the central air at all during the night and that this cools down the bedroom wonderfully.  I highly recommend it.  I've had it for over a month now and it's just a workhorse.  I'm looking forward to seeing how much money I save on the electric bill now with not having to have the air conditioning on all night.  Buy this.  It's a great fan at a very very reasonable price!!!  I figure it will pay for itself after a couple of months.
 Main reason I got this fan was to help cool down the room at night without keeping me up with white noise, and it does that job. It is still just a fan, but it is a good fan. It moves the air around enough to keep the heat at bay and it keeps the noise at a low level hum that doesn't disrupt sleep. It is also tall enough to blow air above the bed without taking much space from the room.<br/>The remote is a plus, but I haven't really used it yet since I mostly use the timer, which I love. The ion option really doesn't look like it does much other than turning on the blue light (which is kind of nice as a night light). Haven't noticed a difference in temperature or quality of the air by turning the ionizer on.<br/>It was quite easy to assemble (I did have to look at the instructions though) and it stands firm and oscillates without issues<br/>All in all, it is a great fan and moves as much air as a box fan without all the noise.
 I just love it!  Contrary to what other buyers said, I found it quite easy to assemble.  Simple put upside down on a soft surface while screwing in base.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I find the oscillation feature not "wide" enough for my needs, but I can live with it.  It is very quiet, the ionizer feature does seem to cool the air, and the directional air is very handy.  Do keep in mind if you have limited space that it is somewhat large.  But I manage to fit in in my bedroom doorway to blow in a/c air from the bathroom.  My bedroom  is pretty large, has only one a/c vent and has SW exposure - making it quite warm.  Even on low I can feel it all the way across the room, bringing down the temperature by about 3 degrees..
 LOVE LOVE LOVE this fan!!! Very quiet, cools our VERY large rooms. Love the swivel feature &amp; the ability to angle the air up or down. Don't know if the ion feature works or not, can't tell the difference in air quality. We had 25 people at our house the other day &amp; it kept the room very cool - Phoenix in late May! Able to keep our AC a couple degrees lower now. Buying at least one more!
 This fan is fantastic.  It feels more like an air conditioner than a fan.  My husband loves it as he loves cool air on him while he sleeps at night and the sound of the fan helps with white noise.  It is loud enough to keep out little noises but we can still hear outside noises such as the trash service trucks in the morning or lawn mowers.  I know quite a few people buy these to cover up noises if they nap during the day or they are night workers.  This might not be for you if that's what you need it for.  I do notice if you fall asleep before the noise, you should sleep through it.  I love how this is really good for those with small children.  Our daughter loves to stand in front of the fan and make her robot sounds.  I'm always afraid she's going to stick her finger in there.  This has small vents and she can't even get her fingers inside the slots where the fan would be.  We loved the first one so much that we purchased a second for our family room.  It's not loud but does give off a cool breeze to the point we don't have to turn down the a/c to keep us cool.  Our family room is around 400 sq. feet and you can feel this fan from all corners.  The oscillating is great and it's does pivot nicely.
 Nice fan. It was not difficult to assemble once I got all the tape and plastic off. It actually was more difficult to get the tape off the wrappings and took longer to do so than it did to assemble this. Note if you try to assemble while sitting on the floor with the fan on its side it is difficult to align. I found this out with a different fan I assembled. If you flip the fan upside down (I did this on a carpet) it is very easy to align and insert the screws. You need to be careful as you don’t want to break the fan. Another option is to lay the fan across something with the bottom hanging over and attach the base.<br/>The fan worked fine. Not the strongest but enough. The remote worked well as did the manual controls. No idea about the ionizer, but the light indicating it was working went on so I will assume it works.<br/>The item is all plastic but seems to stand stable on its base. We have it on a hardwood floor so I cannot comment on stability on a carpet. I like that there is no pedestal and the height is good. Overall so far so good.<br/>I checked the price of this fan and only Walmart was comparable, but, not in stock and longer delivery time. At other stores it was up to $20 more expensive.
 I bought two, one is louder than the other one. The quieter one wobbles when it oscillates. The fans are made in China, I bought two and they both have defects, no surprises. Another review mentioned burning rubber, They were probably smelling the Styrofoam packaging. Another review said they used a screwdriver.. but the screws are thumb screws, so you can turn them with your fingers. Another review said he didn't know where to put the screws and uploaded a video to help others, well that guy is dumb. The base snaps together like a lego in 1 second, then you screw in 4 screws with your fingers and are done. Idiot resistant but not idiot proof
 Got this for my toddler's room as his prior fan got really loud. It works well, produces a decent amount of air flow, and is very quiet. However, we've run it for about 20 hours now and there's a pretty bad plastic smell that comes out when it's on. I hope it goes away soon or I'll have to return it. Not good for a child's room.<br/><br/>Update:<br/>After about 80 hours of use (10 hours per night over 8 nights) the platstic smell is gone. Now I have a quiet fan with decent power circulating the air in my son's room. Favorite feature is the timer -you can set it in increments of 30 minutes from 30 minutes to 7.5 hours. Recommend!
 This fan worked like a dream out of the box and it still does a really good job but after two and a half to 3 weeks of using it at night when I sleep it's starting to make a whining noise and it kind of defeats the purpose of spending good money on a fan if it's going to sound like a cheap one. I never leave negative reviews about products but I really feel like I could have bought a small desktop fan or clip on fan and got the same results. The ion button doesn't do a thing and it might be completely lights up a room. This is not a bad fan at all it just a regular fan in a pretty package. If your ultimate goal is to move a lot of air and you don't mind a little extra noise just get something else for the same price or less
 The remote SUCKS! I usually have to hit power button 3 times before it goes on and then it’s s-l-o-w to get going! It’s often the same with changing speeds. It’s moves as fast as a little old lady! This is my 2nd remote controlled Lasko tower fan. I bought this one for the family room because I liked the wood grain look in front. But the Lasko #2535 I so much better! When I click ON for that remote that fan comes on IMMEDIATELY! This one is crap... especially when you’re having a hot flash and need it on NOW! If I didn’t already throw away the box I’d exchange this POS for another #2535 model. If you buy this one you’re buying it for the looks ONLY!
 As the owner of both the Dyson Air Multiplier AM07 Tower Fan, White/Silver and the Lasko 2551 Wind Curve Tower Fan with Remote Control and Fresh Air Ionizer, I can say the Dyson is very over-rated.  Yes, it has a cool factor the competition may not have, but when it comes down to doing what it is meant to do, move air, it doesn't shine.  The Lasko fan has a similar size to the Dyson, and at a small fraction of the purchase price, I can recommend the Lasko without reservation as an excellent choice.  In terms of noise, air movement, remote control, features and function, the Lasko is every bit the equal to the Dyson, albeit without the cool factor.  If you want to keep cool and move air for the least money, go Lasko.  If you need the cool factor, drop the coin on the Dyson.
 I have only had this fan a short time, but I am pleased with it so far. We use it in a room that is about 200 sq ft and the breeze on all settings can be felt across the room. I would expect a little more out of its highest setting but since the fan is so tall it is being spread out over a large area so it still moves quite a bit of air. The noise is not an issue at all even on high. To me it is a very natural fan noise and very soothing and would be easy to sleep with it on. I can't yet comment on the ionizer, but I have had it on the entire time the fan has been on. Will have to wait to see if the air seems fresher after some time. The base of the fan does seem slightly flimsy causing the fan to rock a little when adjusting the settings which are on the top of the fan. It is very stable when in use but I would think it should be a little more stable. I do like the remote control that comes with it so I see myself using this more than the buttons on the fan itself. There is also a great place to store the remote when not in use. As far as the rotation of the fan when oscillating it doesn't turn as much as other heaters or fans that I have so it does limit the area that is in range of direct air flow from the fan. With some slight improvements I think it would be a 5 start fan. I would definitely buy this fan again if I needed another one.
 I purchased this Lasso Wind Curve Fan for my daughter and grandson. It arrived yesterday at their home and she called me first thing this morning to rave about this fan. She told me they slept the best ever having this fan on. She told me it is nice and quiet and cooled the room down to a perfect temperature. She loves the slim line of it and said it is easy to carry up and down the stairs. It takes up very little space and my grandson even commented on the woodgrain look of it. He said it looked like a fancy car dashboard! I am thinking about getting one for our house as well.  Yes, we have an air conditioner but it makes so much noise I have a hard time sleeping. This fan is almost whisper quiet. I am pleased and my daughter is absolutely grateful and happy that she was able to sleep so well. She has asthma and the fresh air ionized is great. A great find....a great purchase. Thanks Lasso and Amazon!
 Life in the PNW is one where no one believes air conditioning exists - and in this record dry period (50 days without rain) and record highs (well into the 100s for several days) - well, things weren't looking pleasant for most of my friends. I'll be honest with you. I'm from the swampy parts of Indiana, so the fact that Seattle's 100 is actually 100 degrees and not mixed with a claustrophobic humidity just meant that I was mildly uncomfortable but nothing I couldn't live with - but both my roommates and anyone who came over to my top floor condo were dying and turning into liquid puddles around me which was not great at all for any attempts at socialization.<br/><br/>Enter this Lasko fan. (Lasko Wind Curve Fan w/Fresh Air Ionizer, if it's important - I know there are like 12 on the page). I swear - I got it together in five minutes, and it let out cool air.  It's so quiet I sometimes forget it's on, and most importantly, when I combine it with my box fans I get a vortex of air that's pushing all the hot air inside out and keeping it cool inside.<br/><br/>I'm now the most popular person on the block and I don't even have air conditioning.
 This tower fan is very nice and reliable. It's the third Lasko fan I have ever purchased/owned. I purchased this fan to replace a Vornado fan that crapped out on me. It circulates the air around the room well and is not really that noisy. Also, the ion feature seems to work well. Just like the other Lasko fans I have purchased in the past, this one is still working like a champ. I have it on and running for hours on end every day in the living room, but there has been no problems yet, whatsoever. To be honest, I don't expect any, since I have had good luck with this brand. Totally worth the money.
 I absolutely love this fan. We actually used to have a few of these fans while stationed in Japan. Unfortunately when we got to the states I moved across country and I gave them to my in-laws. We moved to the East Coast and then I bought them over there. I ended up giving them to my parents when we left for the West Coast again. I have been looking for some fans. I went to Walmart target you name it and all the fans were extremely expensive. They were around $69.99 to $89.99  for this size fan. They did have a smaller one for $49.99. Costco also have one for sale that was as big as this one for $49.99 but it was very unattractive. Anyways I'm glad I hopped onto Amazon see that they had that's because I didn't see this in the stores. we shouldn't be moving again. So I am keeping these. It blows super cold and is very attractive in the living room. If you have any hesitation to order this don't it's a super good deal and a super good price! I am planning to order one more.
 It actually does cool.  Fans blow air - that's all.  So why did I feel that it was actually cooling to the air?  I'm no scientist, but after a bit of research I discovered that when air compresses and is directed through a small opening it actually does cool the air coming out.  This thing gets cold!<br/><br/>Anyway, my imagination or not aside, the air flow is perfect for my bedroom use, the oscillation is sufficient, and the noise level is better than acceptable.  I love pure quiet but no fans do that.  This is actually pretty darn good for the amount of air it's moving.  I don't care for the fake wood look but others do.  Remote works, though have only used it from a few feet away.  I haven't needed the ionizer, which is supposed to remove stale odors.<br/><br/>Negatives:  Don't count on the clever idea of storing the remote in the fan because it falls out (how in the world do you screw that up?!)  It's a poor carry design.  It's a two-hand carry for a small handed person - you just don't feel like you have a grip on i<br/><br/>I would purchase this again.
 This fan was easy to assemble. I've had it for about two months now. Overall it is still working great but I do feel like the strength of the fan has weakened a bit. I had been using a small desk fan but it wasn't cooling my room enough. The height and strength of this has made a huge difference. I have an alcove studio on the top floor so a lot of heat gets trapped in. This fan does a great job of cooling the space down quickly.<br/><br/>One thing to note - could be considered a pro, could be considered a con. Because I liked the quality of this fan, I also got a Lasko heater. I actually keep both of them out because, even though it's the winter, it can get really hot in my apartment, so at different points of the day I may need one or the other. Lasko remotes appear interchangeable - both remotes work for both items. With one push of a button I have turned off the fan and turned on the heater at the same time. It's frustrating in the middle of the night trying to find the right angle so it reaches the right sensor and not both, but at least I have a spare remote now.
 The best. It's shocking how well and how nice the these machines help. It's night and day. They also work perfect to move air across a bed at night; due to the higher fan zone it most fans would need to be lifted or placed on a shelf. This sits on the floor and moves air over furniture, couches, beds. It doesn't take up room and have toe cutter edges so if you have it in a hall blowing into your bathroom after a hot shower it's not a dangerous toe breaking obstacle. It's easy to lift and turn or run controls. It oscillates or sits and so you could court your spouses needs or be selfish and remote control the machine to just fan you off. At least the fan is quiet and not going to scramble your TV viewing or cause you to not sleep. It's like a 2 out of 10 on fan noise. It would work great for a nursery baby crib due to its height and design it's likely to be very helpful for hotels and office buildings. It's sophisticated and modern looking but would help push smoke, cold or hot humid air just as well as any blade rotary round fan. However this takes up much less space and won't break your toes if you stub them into the base. It's perhaps even better for older people since the remote would allow them to sit and adjust it. So older people whom are ill don't get pnumonia if they can't handle cold air too long.
 I used a Dyson tower fan ($399) -and loved it until it died after 12.5 months. Way too much money for 1 year of moderate use. I purchased the Lasko Wind Curve Fan after reading reviews of several fans. I am very pleased with this purchase. I rarely put this on level 2 or 3 - 1 is more than enough in my bedroom. This is well designed and quiet. I put a Velcro attached "filter" on this...that filter is supposed to cut air flow a bit but I have not noticed it. The Dyson was easy to clean and that filter makes the  Lasko easy too. Would buy another Lasko if the need arises, but would not consider the Dyson in the future. Highly recommended.
 What can I say.... It BLOWS. It can move an impressive (Rare and elitist scientific term of CFM measurement) amount of air fairly quietly. I have no clue if the Fresh Air Ionizer really makes any difference, but I use it when I'm feeling tired anyway. If anything, I like the blue light. It sits on a small cabinet behind me and circulates air around my head in my litte Stuffice (Studio/Office) keeping me cool. Well, as cool as the ambient air will allow that is. I rarely use the remote, but its handy to have around. I hacked the holder and used a binder clip to stow the power cord when not in use.<br/><br/>I'd totally buy another should the need arise.
 Nice looking fan.  Bigger than I thought it would be.  I got it for our workout room with high ceilings where the ceiling fan just wasn’t cutting it for longer runs on the treadmill.  This works well for helping the room cool down and I like the design and slimmer silhouette.  One negative is the smell of the plastics.  It gives me a slight headache every time I turn it on.  I’m hoping this dissipates over time.  I’m also very sensitive to smell, so it might just be me since it didn’t bother hubby at all.  Other than the extreme plastic smell, it’s great and works exactly as intended.
 This is perfect. I was skeptical as it was purchased to help reduce the use of a/c and lower costs for the electric bill, keep in mind I live in central Florida. It is super quiet and has enough force that the air is felt across the room without being too much. I do not regret this purchase! Great packaging and extremely simple assembly!
 Got the fan in today and while running it has a very bad burning plastic smell. It blows air really good air though and easy setup.<br/><br/>I am going to continuously run the fan in the bathroom and see if the smell goes away after a day or two. I am thinking I may need to break it in.<br/><br/>If it doesn't go away I will for sure return it.
 I was really excited to get this fan but, after using it, it is very disappointing. The airflow is not very strong even on the high setting.  The fan itself is a bit wobbly if you change any of the buttons directly on the unit instead of using the remote. The degree/width of the oscillation is not very great and so you cannot feel any air movement except for directly in front of the fan and maybe 12” on either side of directly in front.  I would return this fan if I was able to.
 This was a great investment for the increasingly hot summers. It puts out a decent volume and velocity of air without being obnoxiously noisy. It features a number of different fan modes that can be combined (ion, oscillation, timer, etc.) and it has a remote. Unfortunately, it's not quite smart enough to leave on with a particular setting and be woken up by a smart plug to cool your home before you arrive. The only two negatives are the size and durability. It's slightly too tall to tuck under a bar height counter, but looks good in the corner of a room. Lasko is a well-established fan company and I trust their products, but for an extra $4 I took the extended warranty offered by Amazon just in case my unit proved to be a lemon like some others reported. So far, it's going strong and I'm quite pleased though.
 I am quite pleased, with the operation of this, fan. I have never had a vertical, before, of this kind. I have always chosen either a box-type or pedestal-type. I wanted this, one, because of the Ionizer addition. Have wanted one, for a very long time, but my pedestal Lasko just was refusing to give, up. I finally said to heck, with it, &amp; ordered this, anyhow.<br/><br/>The low setting has enough strength that I feel a good airflow about 10 ft distant, plus. It is also very, quiet.<br/><br/>I have had this for a little over 24 hours, but am telling about it, now, because I have faith in Lasko products. I have been purchasing their equipment for several, years. Each item I have received has lasted for, years.<br/><br/>Thanks, to others who have rated this, item. I think I shall enjoy this fan for years to, come.
 This fan is wonderful. I bought it in the height of summer in Texas. I run it in my home office for 8-10 hours a day at various speeds and functions (timer, oscillate, etc) and it worked fantastically well. Until about a week ago, it was quiet as a strong whisper. Now there is something in the unit itself that has become very noisy. I still give the fan credit, I think I may have just received a faulty one.<br/><br/>I contacted customer support, and I will update this review depending on how they decide to handle this product.
 I ordered this fan to help boost our downstairs window unit air conditioner. There are some days that it's just too hot for it to handle, and we need some air circulation. This fan is taller than I expected out of the box, but in a good way - bigger is better when trying to cool a room. Although some assembly is required (to put the fan on the rotating pedestal) this assembly is simple and the fan comes with directions that are easy to follow. Have a screwdriver handy, as one is not provided. All in all, I had it hooked up and running within 10 minutes and that included time to find a screwdriver. ;)<br/><br/>This fan is powerful and was just what I was looking for. It is the perfect complement to my air conditioner to get the air circulating through the room and provide that extra boost of coolness. I am extremely pleased with the outcome. The dark gray plastic and dark brown wood grain front make it an attractive part of the room - no more of those ugly circular oscillating nightmares! I like that it offers three separate speeds and can be set to a timer - perfect for when you're just using it to fall asleep. I will likely purchase more for the other rooms in our house. A+
 We are so happy that we purchased this fan! It is wonderful! I am not sure why people complained about the blue light on the ion feature, it is not too bright, but should you find that it bothers you I would recommend placing a piece of black electrical tape over the light. This fan cools our large room wonderfully. The ion feature has been a wonderful aid in combating our dogs flatulence problem! I would recommend this purchase to all who want a fan that cools your room quickly and also for the ion feature which has been a God send! My husband has C.O.P.D. and the ion feature really seems to help with his breathing issues, especially during times of high pollen. The room we are using this fan in is twelve feet by sixteen feet and it cools the room quickly and very well. If you have air conditioning in your home this fan will help to lower your electrical bill. I would urge any one who has air conditioning to purchase a few of these fans and to use them with an eye towards lowering your electric bill. We are truly delighted with the performance of this product.

Before we got our first Lasko with due diligence he did his research. Found it deserving of being purchased for our needs: low operational noise, a thermostat to use in conjoction with our A/C or without. Diversified settings, cleaner air and an added component for safety in their blue electrical prong connector. In settings you get it all-directional and different speeds. It will work efficiently in large rooms and the design so slim you can fit it anywhere and it’s not an eye sore, inconspicuous and elegant. I have given it as a gift to friends and they rave about them 🤗. I could go on, and on... but enough said: get one, you’ll like it 😊👍🏻‼️
 So far so good. I read a ton of these reviews and all signs point back to this unit as my best option. I was looking to replace my 10 year old oscillating fan from Costco. I know, unbelievable it lasted that long but it also didn't push out that much air. What I found in these reviews is either they push out a lot air and the oscillating motor breaks or fans where the motor doesn't break but the fan blows weak air. I've had this one for a couple weeks and the fan still oscillates while pushing out more air then my old Costco. I run it at night and have it shut off during the day. My other Lasko is a #4930 which is nice but again, the oscillating stopped a couple weeks after I bought it so now it just pushes air fast in one direction.
 It took me a long time to find the right fan for me, but this is the one. I sleep with the fan on and needed a quiet replacement for my virtually silent tower fan. After much trial and error, I stuck with this one. Although it is not silent, It is pretty quiet and I got used to the noise after about one night. It moves a lot of air, it oscillates silently, and has tons of timer settings. Very good fair price and very attractive looking product. Comes with remote. Only downside may be that the oscillation range is about 45 degrees, which may be too little for some people, but not for me.
 After comparing several fans I decided on this one - mainly because I thought it would be the quietest one. Unfortunately it is not quiet. The output on step 1 is very much sufficient for a small bedroom, so that's a plus.  Tried the ionizer function (which, annoyingly, has a bright blue light when turned on) but not sure what it's supposed to do. Could have returned it but didn't want the hassle. If you're looking for a fan with good output and don't mind the noise, this one will work for you. If you're looking for a quiet fan, keep looking.
 I received my Lasko fan yesterday. My initial impression it's very elegant, turned it on and it's very quiet, tested out the range and I can confidently say it has a wide range for both the air and the remote.  It looks almost like the one advertised except for the one I purchased was from BuyerVPC and it did not have the remote storage area as the one in the video.  That being said, I still love how it looks and how it works.  I did reach out to the seller to inquire about the remote storage area and the customer service was very friendly and gave me helpful instructions on how to file a claim in order to have this documented as well as gave me my options which was pretty much either return it for a full refund or get a one time small discount. After submitting a claim, they got back to me within a couple of hours. I agreed to take the discount because it's a very nice product and functions quite well.  That is why I'm choosing to give them 5 stars for service and product.  I definitely recommend it!
 I love this Lasko Tower Fan. It does exactly what it's supposed to do with some extra features I appreciate. This will not create a cold breeze like an AC unit, because its a FAN. It will keep the air moving in your home/space, which I think helps you feel more comfortable. The strength at which the air blows is pretty good at the highest setting (#3). It's nothing you'll be shocked at, but it does a good job. This definitely helped me and my family this summer when the heat wave started. We weren't about to drop $300 on a portable ac because 1. We don't have the space when in use, and later to store during the cooler months, and 2. That's a lot of cash to drop on something I'm only going to use maybe 3 months out of the year. We've used this fan for almost 3 months now, including at night. At the highest setting, it creates a moderate white noise effect, which doesn't bother my husband or me. I hate dead silence when sleeping, so that's why I like this fan on. But everyone has their own preference so keep that in mind.<br/>I highly recommend this fan if you're looking for a way to cool off in your home without dropping some big bucks.
 My fan completely stopped working yesterday. I ordered this at the end of April.  Worked great up to now. Very disappointed, would expect it to last at least a year even with heavy use. Unfortunately I cannot reccomend this product.<br/><br/>Update:<br/>I was contacted by Lasko and they replaced the fan. I just had to send in the cable. I will update if I have any issues with the new one but so far so good!  Moved it up to 4 stars.
 I was honestly expecting a bit more from this product in terms of the highest cooling setting, but I guess it's alright for what you pay for. Although a previous regular Lasko Pedestal fan that I've had for years seems to bring out more air and cooling out of it than this thing. Nonetheless, I decided to give this to my mother who doesn't need as much cooling, so it worked out in the end.
 Attractive, good air circulation, and a setting that sends negatively charged ions out with the air: I purchased one fan for my residence in a very hot Los Angeles to keep the air moving in my bedroom at night and the air conditioned air of the house circulating around my work space during the day. I bought a second one for the place I stay when I'm in Berkeley. So far, I am impressed. I really like the tall, slender design that fits attractively  into many spaces and makes it easy to move from one room to another.  As for durability, I've had my fans for only a couple of months, but a friend bought one for her work place and it is still performing well after 13 months of daily use.
 This fan has been been great, I work in a home office on the second floor in an old house without much insulation, so it has been really hot. This fan has made my workplace nice and cool. I've also been using it at night while sleeping - it makes the room so cool I have to turn it off or put extra blankets on.<br/>1. It is really quiet - very good for when I'm talking on speaker phone<br/>2. It moves a lot of air<br/>3. The oscillation feature is smooth - no jerkiness<br/>4. Very light - can move from room to room no problem<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the Ionization feature is supposed to do, there wasn't much about it in the instructions. I guess it's supposed to help clean the air. If that's the case, I'm not sure how well it works as my air is pretty clean as is, but that's not the reason I bought the fan. If it does work, then bonus for me.<br/>Just an overall well designed fan, I love it and highly recommend it.
 This is my second Lasko Tower fan. I still use the original one in my living room. I bought it almost 7 years ago and it's been a super reliable workhorse. I run it constantly during hot weather.<br/><br/>The heat waves are getting worse every year and it's hard to sleep at night, so I realized this same fan might be a good solution for the bedroom. It's relatively quiet and it circulates air well. The remote is handy, too.. So ... I bought the same product again. It's a slightly newer version of my 2011 Lasko Tower fan, but overall seems the same. I hope it's just as reliable as my other one!
 I like that it doesn't take up any space, and that it sits right down on its little pedestal instead of on a short stem above the pedestal. I think that makes it a lot more stable than the stem would. And I LOVE the remote control! I'm menopausal, so that's quite a handy little feature for turning on at night from the bed, for those nasty hot flashes that wake me up. It does have a very bright blue light when you use the ionizer (no need for a nightlight if you've got THAT turned on!), but that is purely a personal preference as to whether it's an annoyance or not. And as others have stated, you can always throw a cloth (old sock?) over it to mute or hide it. Other people have complained about the high-pitched(???) noise it makes. I've heard nothing high-pitched on my fan. In fact, I've found that it tends to make more of a low-pitched hum towards the ends of its oscillation radius, which becomes constant if you stop the oscillation after starting it, but doesn't start up at all if you never turn the oscillation on. Some nights that hum gets on my nerves (usually when I'm wired anyway, and not quite ready to go to sleep), some nights I don't even notice it. Again, that's personal preference/sensitivity, not the machine. It's not that the sound isn't always there (it is), it's just that sometimes I notice it and sometimes I don't. I've only had it for about a month, so I can't comment yet on durability, but I was porting it back and forth from the living room to the bedroom at first (now it stays in the bedroom), and that wasn't really all that inconvenient.
 Very quiet operation on all 3 speeds, but especially on the lowest speed. Fan has all the features including oscillation, ionization, and remote control. Has up and down directional adjustment in addition to oscillation to provide excellent coverage of larger areas. The fan is a full 42" tall but the fan opening is about half its total height. I find the fan somewhat bulky and it requires more floor space than anticipated. The "Curve" design is aesthetically pleasing, but does little to nothing to enhance performance.  I would prefer this fan to forego the curve and have a straight, slimmer design.  The vertical stability for this fan could be better and at 42" tall, the fan wobbles when using the manual controls or the holder for the remote. Once running, the fan operates smoothly. Overall, a "very good performer".
 This a replacement for the previous model that lasted us 5 years. To be clear the fan still works but it makes some really strange noises so it will be used in the living room and the new fan will stay in our bedroom. This is our sleeping fan so it runs all night with the ionizer. Ionized air is supposed to help with depression and sleeping and a bunch of other stuff? At least that's what is supposed to make those Himalayan salt lamps so great. I don't know about all that. It's a fan ,it has a pleasing hum, it's familiar, it puts me to sleep.  Also note, these fans are really hard to clean. We vaccum them and we use a can of forced air on them regularly . I really wish they were easier to clean.
 I have a room in my apartment that gets way hotter than any other. I lived here for almost a year, enduring that discomfort before it dawned on me: hey, you should buy a fan. After looking around, I settled on this one and it's been great. This fan is reliable, quiet, and easy to control with the included remote. It doesn't eat up too much floor space with it's vertical design and the ion filter really does make a difference. My one gripe with it is that it's just not as strong as other fans I've had. Most day, this fan is more than sufficient; some days, however, it just gets too hot and this fan is just blowing hot air. If you need a strong fan and don't mind the noise that comes with it, this probably isn't for you. If you're looking for a well-made, quiet fan to take the edge off warm days, look no further.
 Ordered two of these fans since all of the ones we had chose the hottest week of the year to die.  The packaging was pretty beat up, but the fans seemed fine.  One of them makes a rattling noise when it turns, so we put that one in the living room.  The other one has a totally dead remote - we tried two different sets of fresh batteries and it doesn't work at all. Otherwise they do what they are supposed to, more or less.
 We are big fan people in our house. We have a standing Vornado, this fan, another like in the bedroom, plus three rotating air filters that keep the breeze flowing throughout our place. It is a little crazy, but it keeps things cool.<br/><br/>The Lasko is probably our coolest looking fan and we'd say it's the most impressive as well. It moves a good amount of air on its highest setting without sounding like a truck is starting in your living room or blowing all your papers on the floor like a Vornado.<br/><br/>For fans of this style, I think this is one of the bigger non-commercial fans that I've seen in any person's house. It rotates quietly and we keep it running pretty much 24/7. It hasn't had an issue yet and I don't expect it to. The remote is nice feature, but we find that don't really use ours. We just turn it on and keep it on - the Lasko just keeps chugging away. We have a pretty big living room and the Lasko pairs with our standing Vornado to flip the air over on the regular.
 tl;dr - you'd move more air by waiving a folded up magazine in your face<br/><br/>I bought this fan mainly because Amazon flagged it as the #1 tower fan. We have a Lasko "cyclone" fan or something with a similar silly name like that we got at Target. Alas, we're in a heat wave, so all the fans are sold out. I saw a similar Lasko fan (#2554) got rave reviews on thesweethome.com so I poured over Amazon, Lasko's weird 1990s / 2000s website, thesweethome.com, and any other place I could find to get a fan that didn't cost an arm / leg *and* moved air quickly.<br/><br/>Finally pulled the trigger and got this tower fan. Unboxed it, plugged it in, and scratched my head when I realized the "maximum" setting moved less air than the "low" setting on my old fan. Yes, yes, it's quiet. Yes, yes, it "space saving". Yes, yes, it's "ionizing". Other than turning on a blue light my 2-year-old loved to look at, I don't think the "ionizing" actually did anything.<br/><br/>It didn't make it more than 30 minutes outside the box before we crammed it back in. Boo!
 I just received the fan this morning. It came in it's own box only, with no amazon box over it. Normally I don't care about that little detail but because of the lack of protection layers, the box came with a baseball size hole in the front where the top part of the wood grain panel sat against the inside. Now, The fan's very nice looking front panel is an eyesore in my room where the fan is setup. Returning something this huge (the box is almost as high as my chest, and I am 6'1") would be a huge hassle so returning the fan is not an option.<br/><br/>The fan miraculously still works somehow, despite a distinct rattling coming from inside (when shaken) that I assume is a tiny piece of the wood grain panel that broke off and fell between the panel and the front grill where the air comes out. Assembling the fan wasn't as hard as some reviews have said, it's easier if you put the power cord through the bottom hole of the stand, then turn the whole thing upside down and screw the bottom of the fan to the circular stand BEFORE putting the excess power cord in the metal slot in the back of the stand to keep it straight.<br/><br/>Getting to my experience with the fan itself, in my opinion, it's definitely NOT worth a $56 price point. It's only slightly more powerful (on high) than my ancient desk fan that is at least 9 years old. The oscillating feature is nice and I have no complaints with it. The ionizer is so far unnoticeable but I've only used it in my room with the door closed for about three hours or so. I have no idea if because of the damage it's less powerful now, but I'm really disappointed in the product so far. I would appreciate any feedback from Lasko on this issue as they aren't a third party seller so I cannot leave seller feedback to them.
 We love this fan. It is tall. There is a vent to select pushing the air up as well as just out. Ionized air smells good and feels even cooler. My wife tells me it is still the same temperature, but I feel cooler. We would buy this one again. I can now work at my computer desk more comfortably than before. I can hardly wait until Fall and Winter when it will be used just to keep the air healthy and circulating.
 This thing is amazing. It's been pretty hot this summer so far, and I don't have AC in my house. I live about 6,000 ft up so the sun definitely beats down on my apartment moreso than it would at a lower altitude, which makes everything ten times hotter. I wasn't able to keep the temperature down in my apartment, and was worried about leaving my pets in such a warm environment, so I decided to get one of these. It came about an hour ago, and took make 15 minutes for me to set up. So far it's blowing really cool air on the lowest setting and is virtually silent compared to my other fans. Even on the highest setting it wasn't that bad. I know cleaning is gonna be a challenge but I think I'm gonna try the vacuum trick, and if not maybe grab some air duster. This fan is amazing and has cooled my house down to a livable temperature.
 Long overdue review but honestly, I love being cool rather than hot and this baby got me through our hot California summer!<br/>I know it's a fan and not air conditioning but I sleep with it about 3 feet from my face directly at me, on full blast and love the ionizer effect as well, it's a plus.  When it was over a 100 here, it still was better than the ceiling fan alone and another fan on the floor, I think the fact that it is level with your bed (it stands about 3 feet tall) and blows in your face is what does it.  I really never had a horrible night after buying this, easy to set up, the blue light is bright in a dark room but if you want you can cover it up (the blue light) and sleep peacefully.  The ionizer is a major plus for me, knowing how negative ions make you feel better!!!  I actually would not be without one of these, even my dog loves it and she sleeps with me!  Great for the heat even though it's a fan.  I recommend it.
 I had been searching for a new oscillating fan for a while when I came across this one. Some of the reviews were less than pleasing but I decided to go ahead and try it. It has been amazing. I am generally a hot sleeper and needed something that I could have either directly aimed at my face or being able to put it on the oscillating mode for total comfort. I am in love with this one! I sleep comfortably through the night which is a nice change.
 The fan works as advertised, looks nice in the house and moves a high volume of air.  I like it much better than another brand I used to have.  It moves plenty of air through my living and adjacent dining room.  With this fan I can have the AC temperature up several degrees and still be comfortable.  I definitely recommend this product.
 Researched quite a bit before choosing a fan for my 23 foot rv. Selected the Lasko Tower fan due to the great reviews.  Originally purchased model 2511 from Walmart as they had lowest price however it didn't produce much of a breeze.  Contacted Lasko directly to inquire about the difference between model 2511 and 2551.  They stated 2551 was more powerful so I returned 2511 and purchased 2551 through Amazon. There was no difference.  The fan is quiet however the blue "on" light is very bright especially if you like darkness when sleeping.
 Loved this so much I got two more. Just in time, as our AC went out and it was 100° outside.  This made indoors bearable.  I still use it in the living room and bedrooms to circulate the air better. Nice quiet fan. Not sure how the ionizer works as I do not see a plate anywhere, and there is no way to open it up to get to one to clean it if there were. Fan has a good strong breeze on high, and there is a noticeable difference between high, medium and low. The swivel action covers an entire room should you want it to, or turn it off and have it blow right at you. I love the timer feature. With half hour, one hour, two hour and four hour settings, you can select just one or any combination of them to have the fan shut off when you want it to.
 This fan saved us over the hot summer months. The breeze is strong and cool.  Even in a warm room!  It has an extremely simple lay out that even I can understand and remember.  the buttons are very tactile and laid out in a logical way.  The fan was very easy to assemble and comes in a sturdy material.  Our large Labs love to run and play and knocked our poor fan over more than once.  What's that saying?  It takes a lickin and keeps on tickin!  I won't say that it is quiet, because it is not.  Although it is quieter than many other models I have used.  This fan was worth every scent we spent.
 Love this fan. I wanted the tall fan so it takes up less space than a box or pedestal fan like I used to have. Plenty of airflow for my living room. Quiet, too. Not silent, but not at all noisy. I was torn between the smaller size and this one, and am glad I got this one. The smaller size would have been ok on my dresser in the bedroom, but not for a larger room.
 So glad I got this. I live in FL in a very old house with central air. It easily gets up into the mid-80's many days inside. This fan keeps me and my older pets comfortable. Its light weight so easy to move from room to room or even out on the porch. For us, a very good thing to have.
 This cooling fan is absolutely amazing. I would definitely buy it again and am very happy with this purchase. I highly recommend it.<br/>Pros: super cool air, oscillates well, has lever feature to better direct air, remote feature is fantastic and convenient, stands high so air gets across entire room, seems to be made of fairly high quality materials, looks sleek, fairly easy to put together.<br/>Cons: somewhat bulky looking, took me a little to bit together but still fairly easy, somewhat pricey but still a good value.<br/>Overall, an effective and affordable fan, warranting an easy 5 stars!
 Got this for our front room (where we watch movies) which is a small room about 10x12 feet, this fan is quiet enough to not interrupt movies/tv and because of it's height and power is able to keep the room perfectly cool while reaching the back corners even in the hot months. I love stand up fans like this b/c they do not take up much floor space, the fact that it runs fairly quiet and looks nice ta' boot really spiffs up the whole room! It is made of fairly strong plastics, but I bet a few good drops or knocks might crack the unit; sturdy enough for the price though.
 I don't write a lot of reviews, but this fan is amazing so I had to give it credit where credit is due.  It's quiet, not silent, but very quiet, no other type of fan will come close to how quiet it is.  It circulates well, and like all lasko products seems well built.  I have no idea how to determine if the ionizer is working, but the air does seem fresher so there's that.  The one drawback is the blue led light that comes on when the ionizer is activated, which is bright and would keep your room lit at night, which can be fixed with piece of electric tape.<br/><br/>Update: 1/29/2017:<br/><br/>I don't like this fan all that much anymore, yes it's quiet and moves a lot of air, but the gimmicky blue light which can't be shut off, the gimmicky remote, which I never use, the timer which I never use, and the deionizer, seem like un-needed features.  After a couple of years, the base is starting to wear and not move smoothly.<br/><br/>Also, most importantly, why I went down to two stars:  It started puking out sticky dust balls both on the intake and the blower, which was gross, so it was time to clean!  Getting it apart was ridiculous, there are 16 mixed types of fastener screws on the back, that's quite excessive for a piece of plastic, and the only way to clean the thing is to take those screws all out, and then the 120v components are exposed--I put it back together with 4 screws, leaving the other 12 out, you literally can't tell the difference in how it holds together.<br/><br/>There is also no good way to open the front of the unit, which means it can't really be cleaned.  the blower wheel (impeller) doesn't seem to come out either so I had to try to rotate it while sucking it with a vacuum attachment, compressed air might have been a better choice, but do it outside!  Lots of trapped dust came out, it was a big mess.<br/><br/>I'd give this 5 stars if it had come with a pre-filter slot on the back of the unit and was made to be easily cleaned.  I'll be buying a filter , cutting it to size, and taping it on on the back.<br/><br/>Lasko, I hope you are reading this review, the features on this unit were NOT well thought out, when it dies I'll be buying a Honeywell with a filter, or perhaps a HEPA unit.
 GET THIS FAN! This is the second one I bought. The first one I bought a few years ago and it's my favorite. I sleep with it on and it's not loud, but makes that soothing fan sound that helps a person who needs a fan to sleep. It's tall an thin, not obnoxious like some fans are. It doesn't take up a lot of space and can easily be put in a tight space or corner. Comes with a remote, oscillates, different speeds. I wish I had more of them, but they are a bit pricey to get more. Worth the price though and if I was a Rockefeller, I would buy more.<br/>Edited: A year and a half later and it still works perfectly. I use it 8-10 hours a night, every single night. Not super loud - I would even like it a little louder, as I need noise when I sleep, but it's enough. Doesn't take up a lot of space, either. If the one I have ever stops working, I'll get another one.
 I adore this fan! Second time I've purchased it. This one is a tiny bit louder, and the lights are a wee bit brighter, but I just cover the Ionizer light with a scrap of black construction paper taped down, and it doesn't keep me awake. My dogs LOVE the lever that allows me to direct the air downward. Oh, and it's also a bit more powerful that the last one I purchased which lasted about 3 years. This fan probably runs about 18 hrs a day, every day, from Feb thru Nov or Dec. The ionizer really cuts down on the dust here in AZ where we keep windows open a LOT. At the end of the season, we just use our baby compressor and blow out the dust, cover it with a contractor size garbage bag, tape it shut and store it in the garage. And yes, you WILL have to use the giant bags-it's very tall. I usually start it up again outside, blow it out again, then bring it in after a good wipe down. Hope this one lasts as long as the last one!
 This fan does the trick. We wanted to avoid installing a ceiling fan in our Master BR in a new house due to the lovely high ceiling and the desire to have a chandelier instead. But, alas, I get super hot at night, and my DL likes a quiet hum at night, so the dilemma was what to do about that. This fan solved both issues. It stays on my side of the bed and he gets the noise while I get the air. It is just loud enough to soothe one to sleep and keeps cool all night. I'm not sure about cooling an entire room, as that's not what we needed it for, but it works well and tucks away nicely when company comes over. There aren't super bright lights, either, which helps with the night time. The one we tried before had very bright LED lights and was such a distraction at night, but this one is great.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R39CMJ07RS8EWA"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1eoDJI6wNS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91TpyAM-qhS.png"/> Initially this fan was great. The airflow it provides is actually quite surprising given how quiet it is. The oscillation is silent as well; no audible cranking sounds or the like. The remote is simple and works well. The ionization feature noticeably changes the quality of the air for the better. And the design of the unit itself is quite nice.<br/><br/>However, after only a day of use my unit has a periodic rubbing sound coming from the top of the unit, somewhere inside the fan structure itself. It sounds as if something is brushing up against the fan blades every 10s or so, or it could be an imbalance or some bearing issue, I'm not entirely sure as I would have to open the unit up to really see what is going on (which I do not want to do). The periodic rubbing sound is very noticeable and annoying, considering how smoothly the fan runs in between the disturbances. I will give it some time to break in, although I do not think there will be an improvement. Perhaps my particular unit had a manufacturing flaw or something like that.<br/><br/>Update: The rubbing sound is now louder and semi-constant. This is after 2 nights out of the box. I can no longer sleep with this fan due to the noise. Unfortunate, as this fan had so much upside.
 I purchased this fan when two others I had by a top brand died after a year and a half each. I thought I would try Lasko, and it has been a solid purchase. The fan puts out a good amount of air, and it does a great job cooling a whole room. If you're looking for a focused blast of air, however, this is not the fan for you. I wish it would oscillate at a broader angle, but there were no secrets about the trajectory when I bought it. I've had it around a month, and it still works just as well as it did the day I first put it together. Assembly is straightforward and took no more than ten minutes to figure out the directions and assemble the fan with the base. The base is very sturdy, and the locking system it employs upon assembly leads me to believe it will not be unsteady at any point, even when my behemoth of a cat is clawing at the grates. The remote is useful, but if the fan is oscillating, one must wait until the sensor is pointed directly at the sensor in order to change settings. I cannot speak to the ionizing feature because I never use it for health reasons. This is a good fan, and I am hoping it will last a long time.
 The fan was easy to assemble and practical to use. However, we bought it because of the remote control so we would be able to control it without getting up. We put brand new batteries in the remote control but it only worked once! It does not even work when we hold it right in front of the fan. So much for a remote control..<br/><br/>UPDATE: got  replacement! This one works fine!
 Extremely disappointed. It absolutely do not air up a room or any area whatsoever. One has to go directly in front of it to get any air and even so, the breeze coming out is not exhilarating at all. The first night i turned it on it was powerful, and after two nights ( when I said night, i'm not talking about having it on the whole night, i mean four hours top, i.e, the most) performance went down hill. I think i got a faulty one, but if it is performing how it should, then the description was intentionally misleading. That's the way i see it because of my experience with it. I really am disappointed.
 We have a similar fan by another company at work. I wanted one for my home. After researching I went with this one and am glad I did. My wife was skeptical but after it arrived she fell in love and purchased another for upstairs. This fan is slightly taller than similar models by other makers which makes it great for use near our bed.<br/><br/>I love that it has a remote and several settings (oscillate, 3 speeds, ionizer and timer) you can also adjust the airflow on the fan itself (like the direction lever on a car's air vent). It's fairly quiet especially compared to the fan we have at work.<br/><br/>I also like the dark gray and "woodgrain" finish. It looks nice in our rooms and isn't an eyesore the way a white fan would be.  Very pleased with our purchase(s).
 This is my second tower fan. It works as you'd expect. This one blows notably more air than the Honeywell Quietset, but makes more noise doing so. It's not the quietest tower fan, but it does a nice job of replacing any fan you currently have and will be much quieter than the regular round bladed variety and probably have a similar output.<br/><br/>This one has some nice features: the ionizer function, remote / timer, and a small adjustable up/down set of blades at the top of the fan that make it easy to set up for bed height. It has been well thought out, and seems durable. I've run it day and night for weeks and it's still going strong.
 I own a Lasko heater which I've been very happy with for several years now. It's simple, reliable, works well and never seems to let me down. I would give that heater 5 stars in a heartbeat. So naturally when it came time to buy a fan, I immediately went to Amazon and searched for Lasko fans. Sure enough I found this one which seemed to have great reviews and all the features I needed. I purchased it right away without hesitation.<br/><br/>It's been a couple of years now, however, and suffice to say I'm not exactly impressed. There's a few reasons why I feel this way: first off, this fan is very large. It was much bigger in person than I expected. Secondly, despite how large the fan is, it doesn't move very much air. Even on a mild summer night I cannot rely on this fan to provide much relief at all.<br/><br/>At first I thought maybe I was expecting too much, however, my brother owns a smaller fan he purchased for a similar price at Costco, and his fan is much more powerful and moves far more air. Next summer I'm going to shop for a new fan and I will update this review if I have better luck with that.
 I ordered a different Lasko fan last year that I loved but my husband broke it and it’s not available on amazon at the moment so I decided to give this one a try. It’s quiet and blows nice cool air but it doesn’t blow as hard/far on the highest setting compared to my last fan. For $55 it does it’s job, the only thing I hated was the smell, we had to really air it out it made our bedroom stink.
 Other than the fact that this is a fan, and it works like a fan, I cannot say anything positive about it.<br/>Out of the box this fan is very loud. In fact, I ordered a new fan because my previous Lasko tower fan was aging and had acquired a loud and annoying bearing noise after several years of nearly 24/7 use. This NEW Lasko fan is even louder and more annoying while putting out less of a breeze. Furthermore, the new fan came with an intermittent and loud buzz which emanates from the top of the unit.<br/><br/>The buzz coming from the fan isn't a deal breaker (I can fix that kind of thing), but the bearing noise is unacceptable. I also have a sneaking suspicion that the fan itself is badly out of balance.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a low noise tower fan, look elsewhere. Obviously, a fan of this design will not be whisper quiet, but out of the box, this new Lasko is louder than a 1980's high velocity bathroom ceiling fan. This piece of low quality garbage isn't worth $10.00, let alone nearly $60.
 I have always purchased only Lasko fans.  They have always served well.  This fan works well enough as long as I don't choose the oscillating option.  That causes the fan to make a loud, clicking noise as it swivels back and forth.  I need that feature, so I can not choose five stars.  I will call Amazon and check into the potential for a replacement.
 I use this fan every night and it is perfect for our bedroom.  Very stylish and Easy to put together as well.
 I purchased this Lasko fan because all the Lasko fans I purchased (total 13) for both home and office have really been great. They are strong, reliable, very quiet. This particular one was very disappointing. It was fine the first week and of course after I have thrown out the box, the fan starting acting up. It makes such a racket, very loud that I have to turn it off at times just to get some peace. I will purchase another one and definitely keep the box until the return window closes. I give it 2 stars only for the Lasko brand. If any other brand I would give it a 0 if I could.
 I live in a small apt., and this fan cools so well, I didn't have to use my AC as much, and saved money. It is very well constructed, and attractive as far as fans go. I've had it almost a year, and everything is working perfectly so far.
 Purchased this to replace an old, noisy floor fan.  This fan isn't as quiet as I was expecting based on other reviews, but it's still a million times better than what I had before.  It moves more air and makes much less noise.<br/><br/>I didn't think the remote control would be that useful, but I found I used it much more than expected.  Depending on the weather: turn the fan off or on without getting up, or change the fan speed.  I guess it's like a TV remote control.  I can remember having to get up to change the TV channel and volume, and that didn't seem abnormal at the time, but if I had to do it today, I'd be saying "what!?!?!"  Technology marches on ...
 We rented our apartment in March, thrilled with all the large windows, throughout.  What we failed to realize is that every single one of them slides open side-to-side, and won't hold an A/C.  Come June and July, our place turned into a greenhouse.  Our two little fans weren't cutting it, and even with the blinds dropped and angled to reflect the sun, and the windows open and the fans going full blast, vainly attempting to drag in a bit of fresh air, our place was a hot, stagnant, intolerable mess.  Getting outside is fine for much of the day, but during the sunburniest hours, and our toddler's naptime, we just had to be inside.  So we got this, and it is lovely.  Its not an A/C, won't do anything for humidity, but it does get the air moving well--better than a rotary fan--and freshens it up nicely.  It probably wouldn't cut it in a more humid climate, but it's been enough for Western Washington during our record high early summer.
 There are two things to be aware of when you purchase this.  You should get a measuring tape and see just how tall it is...I do have not a good sense of size and was surprised.  However, the small footprint means that this wasn't an issue, at least for me.  Second, you need a phillips screwdriver to assemble the base - not a big deal, and it only took a minute.<br/><br/>If you need a fan for white noise to sleep, this is a great fan.  There are three settings, and the lowest one is a little quiet for me, but the middle setting is perfect.  Also, this is great if you live in a dusty old house or have pets (both apply to me).  They make my allergies act up occasionally, but this makes the air so fresh and really helps.  Even in the winter, I leave the fan on low so I can keep the ionizer going.  When it's on low in the winter, it doesn't make me freeze because the speed is very low.<br/><br/>I do not move it, so it has held up very well.  Because the base is made up of two parts, I do not know that it would hold up well to being moved constantly.<br/><br/>I use the hose attachment to clean the fan whenever I vacuum - it is easy and helps keep the air fresh.<br/><br/>I will be purchasing a second for the house - this is a great fan.
 We purchased three of these to use as flying insect repellent for outdoor catered events, and the airflow appears to be effective with the fans 5-10 feet away from the food tables. The fans present reasonably well, and have nice oscillating features. Both a benefit and hindrance is the fact that they are pretty light, so they are both easy to move, but may blow over in gusting winds.<br/><br/>The fan was easy to assemble (the base comes in two pieces), and I cannot attest to the ionizing features.
 I've owned this fan for 2 seasons now and still believe it's the best vertical fan out there. I use it in my Man Cave / Theater to keep air moving. It's very good at moving air about a rather large room (16x25). I like the quiet blower, even on high speed. The remote is a bit touchy. You need to be point it directly at the unit however the claim that it doesn't work very far is total wrong. 25' away and it functions just fine. It is a sight to sight remote. As for being top heavy, I disagree. The unit is heavy enough to stand strong on the base however it is a bit wobbly at the pivot point on that base. Since you won't usually keep the unit standing in the middle of the room, more like in a corner, the chance of tipping it over would mean that you will have to run into the wall too. It would be possible for a medium to large dog to get playful enough and tip it over during a clumsy run around. It is very safe around young toddlers and cats. Nothing to get your fingers injured on or in. I highly recommend this fan.
 I purchased this fan a few months ago while it was still chilly outside because I needed to replace a plastic Lasko fan that I bumped into one night and broke. Opting for the tower design was definitely a good idea since it is much quieter than conventional circular fans, it takes up less space, and looks more sophisticated. The remote is a nice bonus to have when you are across the room (20 feet away) and want to oscillate or bump up the level. This one fan is powerful enough to circulate the air in the whole front half of my apartment (Foyer, Living room, Dining room, and hallway). The Ion feature is also nice, even though i'm not sure exactly what it does or how effective it will pan out to be. Because I purchased this fan in early spring the price was only 42$ instead of the current 65+$ list price. It is definitely worth the 42$ with free shipping, however i'm not sure if i would personally spend more than 50$ on a fan.
 I bought this fan after another tower fan that I had finally died. I knew I wanted one with a remote so I could control the fan from my couch. I have physical pain problems and that feature is invaluable to me. This remote is terrible. It is flimsy plastic and doesn't work unless you aim directly at the front of the fan, which is difficult when it is oscillating, and then you have to repeatedly hit the button to get it to do what you want. That is a huge bummer for me and I wish I had known that before purchasing.<br/><br/>The other parts of the fan are great so I won't bother returning it. It is larger than I thought it would be at 35" tall. The power the fan has is great and it really circulates the air in the room. The ionizer is a nice bonus although to be honest, I have no idea if it is actually doing anything. All in all it is a good fan for the money.
 Overall I'm happy with the purchase. I needed a fan to use in my apartment to keep air circulating between rooms. I've placed it in the hallway and it does the job quietly.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>The fake wood on the front actually makes the fan look better than the generic all-plastic competition.<br/>Fan blows air well enough to circulate and slightly cool a medium sized room ~12' x 12'<br/>The remote works well and is simple to use.<br/>Assembly of the fan is very easy.<br/>The fan is quiet enough that I can be on the phone without interference or background noise.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>The fan feels very wobbly even with screws tightened. This doesn't affect the operation of the fan, but I can't help but notice it when pressing buttons. It's sounds like squeaky plastic when it wobbles and that detracts from my overall opinion of the fan.
 Purchased this fan to replace an old tower fan that had started making random clicking noise during the night. This fan makes enough noise to drown out sounds from out but is not too loud to be annoying. We only use the fan on low in our ~200SqFt bedroom and it cools the room. Medium and High is too much for the room.<br/><br/>Only complaint is the blue light for Ionizing function will light up the whole room. Nothing some well placed tape won’t remedy.
 I read a lot of reviews for fans and I ultimately ended up buying this one because the reviews said that this fan seemed to blow cooler air for some reason, and that seems to be true. The people who had trouble assembling this fan should never shop at Ikea. The base comes in two parts that fit together and there are 6 screws 4 of which have little knobs on them so you don't even need a screw driver. And that's it. Several people said that their fans started making rattling sounds after about a month. That hasn't happened to mine, but I will update my review if it does. I'm not really sure how much the ionizer helps purify the air because I don't really use it.
 Ordered on a Sun and arrived Tues!!  Very quick shipping.  Product as described and very easy to assemble.  Total of 6 screws of which two required a Phillips head screwdriver.  Believe me if I can assemble so can anybody else!!  LOL<br/>Immediately used fan and is fairly quiet (sounds like a fan) and doesn't interfere w/conversations or TV.  Very strong, cold output which is perfect for my "out-of-whack" external thermostat (aka menopause) 😉 Love this fan and is aesthetically  pleasing to the room decor too
 Got my Platinum Tower today . Came with 6 screws to mount the tower on the base . It was a simple and easy mount to install . Remote control however did not come with the required batteries (  2 AAA Batteries ) . Once I plugged in the unit it started making a tick,tick,tick sound as it was working . At first I thought ohhhh noooo this will take a little time to get used to this noise . HOWEVER,,,,,,,,,,,After running for a few minutes the ticking noise stopped completely , and it's now running very smooth and QUIET . This unit is absolutely an upgrade over our other Lasko fans . I ordered a total of 5 of these , and boy oh boy am I glad that I did !!! I highly recommend this to all . If your even remotely thinking about making this purchase , Do yourself a favor and buy it,,,,,,,Buy a few , You won't be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
 I love this fan. I just purchased two more with the mahogany trim. I think the investment of three fans in my condo will pay off if I stop using the condo AC and accompanying central fan. I love the feeling of a breeze. It is quiet and attractive and relaxing.The instructions are not very clear, but I figured it out. It took about 25 minutes.
 I read a LOT of amazon reviews before deciding on one of these tower fans.  And I am thrilled with the final decision.  This one has 3 different speeds, the possibility of oscillating or not, and an "ionic" button.  I am not sold on that button doing anything, but whatever, it is there if you'd like to try it.  I've turned it on a few times and don't notice a difference.  I love that it comes with a remote so I can turn it on and off from bed without getting up.  I read comments about the sound and the lights on this thing, and I am happy to report that as far as fans go, it is very quiet.  It drowns out some background noise, but that is nice in my urban neighborhood when I am sleeping.  The light is very small and very dim.  I am the kind of person who needs the alarm clock on the lowest brightness so it doesn't bug me when trying to go to sleep and I have not noticed this light at all.
 FAN-TASTIC product. This Lasko 2551 Wind Curve Platinum tower fan could use one lower speed to allow even quieter/silent operation and slightly lower breeze, but it's everything I'd expect from any QUALITY TOWER FAN and at a reasonable $59.99. At the lowest setting, it is not silent, but it is quite quiet and is WAY QUIETER than Vornado tower fans by far. This Lasko even has an OSCILLATION option that is totally silent AND an IONIZER option as well! I can easily watch a movie or TV with this on the lowest setting and maybe even the medium setting, and the medium and high settings are NO MORE LOUDER THAN WHAT I'D EXPECT with the additional power and air displacement -- definitely no ridiculously loud blowing sounds here. There is even a very convenient, full-function remote (line-of-site) and a WONDERFUL TIMER that can be set from as little as 30 minutes to 7-1/2 hours, with 30 minute intervals, so I don't have to worry about turning it off later.  I do have to agree that the blue light that turns on to indicate that the IONIZER is working is not really, really bright, but it is a bit too bright in a dark room; TIP: I've actually just taken a black marker and shaded over the black tinted plastic in front of the blue light which helps to reduce the blue light that shines thru -- it's quick, simple, and definitely reduces the intensity of the blue light without a noticeable change to the appearance. I'm definitely recommending this well functioning fan and hope it lasts a long time. Cleaning it may be an issue later tho.<br/><br/>FYI, this fan is not Energy Star Certified, but I really couldn't find any that were during my internet searches; I hope it doesn't waste too much electricity.<br/><br/>**********<br/>Update on 8/3/15<br/><br/>Lowered rating after using the fan in a completely quiet room. Fan is a bit noisy, but still puts out plenty of breeze on the low setting. Like I said earlier, I wish there were a lower setting for silent operation and less breeze. Still a four star fan tho'.
 I bought this fan on March 3, 2012 and it's June 12, 2014. I can't sleep without fresh air blowing in the room so I use this fan every single night no matter how cold it is outside.  During the warmer months I also pull it out to the living room to keep us cool during the day. The bottom line is that it has not faltered once in more than 760 days/nights. It pushes plenty of air...more than any other tower fan we've ever used and just as much as any pedestal or box fan, in my opinion. I never did get the hang of using the air ionizer part, it always turned off when I tried. Recently my daughter tried it and it stayed on so I'm not sure what was with that, I've just been happy with the fan part.<br/><br/>There are cons:  The brightness of the lights on it (too bright) and the loud beeping it does when you push a button (very loud).  Those weren't game changers for me, I want flowing air more than anything and that's what this fan gives.<br/><br/>I don't know why I had a slightly less than excellent opinion of Lasco years ago, maybe because their prices were so reasonable that I thought they must be selling junk. Now, as I look around, I realize we have many of their fans and space heaters and despite continuous daily use, they almost never wear out.  I like it when a company makes great products and sells them at reasonable prices.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading, and have a comfortable summer.
 Not sure if something happened along the way or if the seller's distribution center has disgruntled shipping employees but this arrived with all kinds of holes, rips &amp; tears on the box. The picture attached is just one example. When I opened the box the plastic wrapping was pushed all the way down to the base like it had been removed. Amazingly, the unit itself was not damaged and seems to be working fine for now.  I'll update this review at a later time and adjust the star rating accordingly.
 This cools my bedroom perfectly! I am currently living in a dorm-like building, so certain rooms receive adequate AC and some (like my room) do not. I suffered through the last couple years and finally broke down and bought a tower fan to use.  I now use it almost daily and don't know how I ever dealt with the heat without it. Particularly in the evenings, it is really nice to not wake up sweating or have really restless sleep due to discomfort.<br/><br/>The fan itself works amazingly well! I typically use the high setting right now (it is summer), but I'm sure the medium and low settings will be nice for the Fall. The fan also has a sleep timer which is awesome. I have used it a couple times but, since the fan turning off made my room hot again and woke me up, I am mostly just leaving the fan running all night.  Again it will probably be nice when the weather is a bit cooler. It is a relatively quiet fan, so I sleep through it with no problem. There is an ionizer setting, though I haven't really used that much and don't know how to really judge whether that works well or not (I've never had one before). Finally, probably one of my favorite features is the remote control! I keep my fan on the wall furthest from my bed, so it is nice to be able to use a remote when I want to change settings rather than having to get up and walk across the room to mess with it. The remote can also be used to choose whether the fan is oscillating or not, so I often use the remote to line up the stream of air where I want it to be (sometimes I want it directly on me and sometimes I prefer it pointing somewhere else).<br/><br/>Overall, a great product for a great price. 5-stars, for sure!
 Received the fan today, so this is a day 1 review.<br/><br/>Installation / Setup<br/>Installing the base platform was simple and straightforward.  Takes 2 minutes and a total of six screws.  Remote uses 2 AAA batteries.<br/><br/>Operation<br/>When I turned the fan on for the first time I cycled through the fan speeds several times thinking I hadn't found "High".  This model is very quiet and thus also not a very high output fan.  In all fairness, it does produce enough air circulation for my home office.  However, my previous Lasko tower fan model produced so much circulation that I typically had it on the medium setting.  The rotation feature is just as silent and smooth.  Overall, I wish the fan had a bit more horsepower so that it could operate effectively in larger rooms.  However, I may grow to appreciate the quiet operation.<br/><br/>Appearance<br/>Fan looks sharp and looks exactly like the product pictures here.  The remote is just a bit smaller than your palm.<br/><br/>Maintenance<br/> Will update this review in time if any maintenance related issues occur]
 I bought this on Amazon last July because I thought it would be high quality (based on price) and liked the modern design, which would look good in our living room. It was OK while it lasted.... less than a year. For $60, I expect more. I bought a $20 floor fan from Walmart at the same time. It creates just as much breeze  and is still going strong. I'm really disappointed in this purchase.
 I did a lot of research before settling on this fan. So far I am happy with my purchase. I currently have this set up next to my bed and my review is based on that.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>-Aesthetically pleasing (I've received several complements on the look)<br/>-Has the potential to move a lot of air<br/>-Remote works well (buttons have a nice feel)<br/>-Great price<br/><br/>Cons<br/>-Would prefer a lower setting (As others have mentioned, even on the lowest setting it moves a decent amount of air)<br/>-The fan could be quieter as well<br/>-The remote has no backlight which makes it next to impossible to use in the dark<br/>-Air purifier doesn't seem to do much<br/><br/>With all of that said, great fan for the price. I would purchase again.
 I bought this for my wife who is a teacher and her classroom tends to get hot during the warmer months. This unit has several speeds and will oscillate if you want it to. This unit surprisingly enough actually puts out semi-cooled air which I imagine is just from the design of the fan. The wife loves it so that is plenty for me.
 I so wanted to like this fan based on the reviews. It's just the wind speed is not enough for me. The air coming out of the fan is cool but, by looking at the size of it, I would expect it to have great wind speed.  Especially on the highest speed level. Unfortunately I had to return it.  It just wasn't for me. I have noticed from my experience when it comes to tower fans that either hit and miss and this one was truly a miss for me.
 I like Lasko fans.  They're not hugely expensive and they last.  I've got some older ones (5-6 y.o.) that I'm upgrading and the new ones are a lot better constructed.  Assembly is four thumbscrews - no tools - to attach the base (the only assembly item).  The 2 piece base, which used to screw together, now interlocks and is more rigid than before.  And the fan is quiet.  As quiet as the 36" fans I've also purchased.  One item not mentioned (or at least I don't remember it) is that this one, unlike the smaller units, has adjustable vanes that allow air to be directed more upwardly, which makes for much better circulation in, say, a dining room where there are a lot of airflow obstructions.
 I was skeptical on this one.  I hate putting a AC unit in my window.  I read the reviews on this.  Thought I would give it a try.  I’m not kidding.  It cools the room almost as good as a window AC.  And I’m sure it will help my electric bill this summer.
 lasko makes a very nice fan I took away 1 star because remote does not work as well as older models of same fan
 I purchased three of these fans back in 2014, my mother, sister and I still use them daily.<br/><br/>In my small apartment, it's perfect white noise while I sleep and noticeably cools the living room during the day. It most definitely saves me money on electricity during the Florida summers. I have brought this fan camping on four occasions where it was exposed to dirt, rain and insects, it continues to function without flaw. The remote still works too!<br/><br/>Great fan, well worth the relatively inexpensive price.
 I have a small apartment and this fan is perfect! It is made for a small space. It has a small footprint and really does a good job of moving air. It is quiet, it oscillates, it has three speeds and it has a remote.<br/><br/>I had no trouble with setting it up because my sixteen year old son did it in about five minutes. He did not need a screwdriver and, knowing him, I doubt he looked at the instructions. It was working flawlessly when I got home.
 I am happy that I purchased this fan. I use it often especially at night while I'm sleeping.  I don't get any cross-breeze in my bedroom and this allows me to have the feeling of a nice flow of air over me. I don't use the ionizer while I'm sleeping, though, because the blue light is very bright.<br/>I find the fan to be very quiet. Yes, you will hear the air blowing but I don't hear and other noise as it swivels.<br/>I will most likely buy another one so that I will have one in each room.
 This thing makes all the difference in the world for my apartment. I have a wall AC unit in my common room, but my bedroom is a U away from it so air has a really hard time making its way in. This fan solves that perfectly: my bedroom is now cooler with my wall unit on fan only than it was with the wall unit on full blast. Ionizing is a plus.<br/><br/>My favorite thing about this fan is that it is at completely bed level and oscillates. As a result, while it blows cool air into my bedroom, it also blows it directly over me in bed so I'm kept at a very comfortable temperature even on hot summer nights, even under sheets on memory foam.<br/><br/>The drawbacks are that it is a bit louder than I expected from the description and reviews, even on the lowest setting, but it's not enough to bother me or prevent me from sleeping feet away from it, just noticeable. It's also fairly cheaply made with light plastic, but at $40 for a fan this effective that is to be expected. It looks and functions like a fan twice its price so overall I'm happy with it.
 As others have stated - fan is great, but remote is not.  The first new set of alkaline batteries allowed me to use the remote at just a little beyond arms length from the fan.  I was considering returning it after trying three different, new sets of batteries. Fourth times is the charm?  I don't know, but with the fourth set of batteries (fresh from WalMart Duracell) I was able to use the remote from about 6 feet IF (and ONLY IF) it is pointed exactly at the IR sensor  top, dead center of the front control panel].<br/><br/>The fan is great!  I set it right in front of the floor A/C vent and it circulates the air very nicely, even on the low setting.  Nice looking, quiet and effective.  We bought it to replace a ceiling fan that was making noise in the living room.  When I went to replace the ceiling fan, I was amazed that our dropped ceiling had supported the fan all these years! I refused to unsafely hang a fan to a tiny little dropped ceiling tile furrowing strip!!  No electrical box or anything! Just the tiny half inch board!  Anyway, There was no easy way to properly support a fan so I bought this fan and a ceiling light.
 This fan is one for the ages.<br/>Pros:<br/>Love the ION function.<br/>The timer is a plus, especially if you want to keep it running while sleeping at night<br/>The oscillating feature is nice<br/>The air that blows from it is cold, which is a plus for those who don't have window fans or don't have access to fans to cool a room<br/>Cons:<br/>It does make a bit of noise, but not more than any other fan
 It arrived a bit later than estimated date which I needed (no longer need) and it was actually broken, made so noisy weird loud sound as I turned the power on, I hear just the noise and nothing worked.<br/><br/>But I didn’t have time to take this to either UPS or Amazon drop off location, nor had no time to wait for picking up guys at home while I have been always busy being outside. (I ordered this for my home.)<br/><br/>I no longer be able to return the item. So unfortunately this became a completely crap and need to be thrown away.
 We needed a powerful large fan to cool our living room, which is about 11 x16.  This fan did not disappoint.  I was actually shocked by its size, its huge!  Take note of the measurements if you are looking for a smaller tower fan.  It did require some assembly, but nothing I couldn't handle, just a few screws on the base which is needed for it to work properly because like I said, its huge.  I love the look of it, the remote control is pretty awesome.  It kicks around a decent amount of air as well.  Much more than my last fan and surprisingly did cool the room down.  Its relatively quiet as far as fans go, but its not completely silent.  We found ourselves turning the TV up slightly when it was running.  I give it 4 stars for a couple reasons, I did expect after seeing its size that it would be a little more powerful, but its still good.  And  my biggest compliant was how amazon shipped it to me.  It was just shipped in its box like you would see it in a store.  The box was huge so I understand why they did that, but it should have been wrapped or re-boxed or something because any of my neighbors knew what was sitting on my doorstep and could have stolen it.  Other than that, I am happy with this purchase.
 This fan blows. I have other models from this manufacturer, and I like them all. There are a couple of issues I have with this model, but they are minor. I am not convinced they’re a little ionization thing does anything at all other than turn on the blue light. Also, previous models gave a little audio indication when you press the buttons on the remote. This one doesn’t, and that’s a little bit inconvenient. But Really, this fan operates as advertised. It pulls area in from the back pushes it out front. Good job on that guys!
 Less noise, feels durable quality!<br/>I was having a hard time to sleep because of a little fan with a great noise, no matter the speed it made a lot of noise, so with this I feel like a great upgrade in sound quality and also the amount of air that this guy pushes is very good.<br/>Something that surprised me after start using it was the feeling of actual cool air, it feels like it doesn't just push hot air, but instead it pushes really cool air. I like to use the Ion function just in case, and honestly since I replaced my old noisy fan for this guy i feel i ever breathe better, is like i was continually constipated in the past for some reason, and now my nose feels clear all the time (I am very surprised about this), i use it in my bedroom and something that I'm trying recently is to position it so i don't receive direct air flow, but instead I aim it in a fixed position like my feet for example all night long so it circulates the air instead of actually aiming it directly on my face or body.<br/>On the less favorable side (which is no big deal to me because i don't use those features that much at all) i found the leds quite annoying for a person that likes to sleep in a pitch dark room so i decided to use electric tape to cover the speed and the Ion leds, I don't use the timer at all so no need to cover those either, so just a little piece of tape in the front of the fan would do the trick.<br/>Now let's talk about the remote, simple, fells kind of like shock resistant, but something i didn't actually like is the fact that in order for the fan to comunicate with the remote they need to be facing in a straight line, so if it is swinging or if it is facing away from you, chances are you are going to struggle to make that fan receive commands from the remote that comes with it =(<br/>I don't give less than four stars because i wanted to give it 5 stars because of the way i use it, it does what is the most important to me, and in a great way, feels very durable, nice and cool air flow... other than that little details that i don't care too much about.<br/>Great job Lasko, i sleep way better now! =)
 We have four fans in the house, and an additional 3 that no longer work well, or don't oscillate or worst of all make terrible noise. This one not only looks good, but it is quiet. It does not have a wide range for oscillation, but is adequate for a 10 x 10 room.  I'm not sold on the concept of Ionizing, but you don't have to turn that part on. One thing this fan has that I have not seen on other fans is a louvre function that allows for a vertical adjustment of air flow. It was super easy to put together. 4 thumb screws and two small screws and we were in business!  Best fan I have ever purchased, and that is after just a few hours of operation.
 I gave 4 stars because of this fan while it works fine it is not what is being advertised in the video. In the video, a different remote control is shown and they show a storage area in the back of the fan. There is no storage area in this fan. No big deal but I do like to receive what I order. I already own a similar Lasko fan that's been good for years. They are reliable. This fan is NOT as powerful as my other one, but I guess it will do. It is quiet and that's a plus as I intend to use it at night in our bedroom. I do like the looks of it, I think it looks nice.
 I love this fan!  It works great and I love all the features it has; different fan speeds, oscillation; remote control.  I love the remote control.  I personally don't think the fan is loud, but that depends on the person.  It has three speeds, and as you increase the speed it get a bit louder, but not bad.  I love it.  It's easy to move around, it's sturdy - won't knock over easily.  I highly recommend this product, and may buy another one for another room.
 I previously had this same exact fan and it was so amazing that I used it every single day and night until it burned out. For the great price that I paid and the excellent quality, I would say I got way more than my money's worth out of that fan. I was sad, however, and wanted another immediately so I came to amazon. I ordered this one, and while it looks exactly like the older model, it came in an updated style (still very true to the picture of the fan). It's amazing! Super quiet, works extremely well at moving the air, and I love the ionizer. It has a timer on it so you can set it if you are leaving or maybe going to sleep, and it comes with a remote. One thing that I will note is that my last model used to click while oscilating which drove me slightly crazy, but this one is silent! Putting it together was very simple.<br/><br/>The only thing that aggravates me is the tiny blue light. It never goes off, so if you are a person who uses a fan in the bedroom and likes a completely dark room, like me, this may also get to you. .....But the fan is so awesome that I don't even mind! When it came time to get a new one, I didn't even think about another brand or model. I will surely use this one until it burns out, too!
 Love my fan! Living in the South with the humidity, rain, humidity then heat if your not careful your electric bill can be higher than your neighbors hair! So I needed something for my room at night to keep me from melting. The tower fan is great, sits in a corner doesn’t take up space, rotates, low setting is super quite, &amp;  high setting is very powerful. The remote is super cool to have, who wants to get out of bed to change the setting on their fan. Make sure to order AAA batteries for the remote and you’ll be set! Worth every penny! One of my great finds of 2018!
 Quiet but powerful and the remote for oscillation, on/off and timing features is great. It cools/circulates our living room (about 60 sq ft) and we bought another one for the master bedroom which works awesome. The tower shape and wood inlay on black looks much nicer than the cheap white plastic fans, it blends into our house. CA housing doesnt have central air so these fans are great for apartments and offices.
 We bought two of these fans with the hope that they could effectively cool our 1300 sq ft condo on warm days without having to constantly run the air conditioner.  I am happy to report that they are both very effective at moving the air and keeping our place cool!  In addition to their ability to cool, the fan is nearly silent on the first two speed settings and has a very nice ionization feature that does seem to help eliminate odors.  This is a feature we only use when we cook food that leaves a linger scent.<br/><br/>In addition to the ION setting, it does have a sleep timer which is very helpful.  It allows us to leave the fan running for the pets for the hot afternoons or to leave it running a little longer after we leave if there are still some lingering scents! The timer is a very nice feature I have never seen before.<br/><br/>If you are looking for an affordable, well built fan that moves air, look no further!
 The air produced by the fan is substantial versus, say, fanning oneself with a magazine. It doesn't really compare to the power of a bladed fan 1/4th the price. However it does oscillate, it has a convenient remote, and it takes up minimal space. It's also much quieter than the box fan I'm used to using. I was surprised for how much I spent, how flimsy the base of it was. Soft plastic. I suspect that if you knocked into it hard enough it would both fall over and snap at the base.<br/><br/>Otherwise, aesthetically it works. The neutral grays fit seamlessly into most spaces and if you can force yourself to forget how flimsy of a material the base it, it almost looks like a sturdy metal monolith. Inevitably, it's ability to be a fan is the primary consideration so far as I'm concerned. It's just not a strong fan. I would suggest using it in a cubicle or bathroom or some other small room where it's output can be appreciated and is noticeable - that is a big selling-point for bladeless fans after all.
 First of all the night and at of this can is good. It fits nicely in a corner. It oscillates  back and forth widely.  I have it sitting on hardwood floors and it's Pretty quiet. However, when I had it On high (#3), I thought it was On low. It was very disappointing. I thought maybe I had it in too big room, so moved it to a smaller bedroom. It was still inadequate but I did not want to take the thingto post office for return. Bulky package. Anyway, I had a tornado and have both of them going in the living room a d the pair seem to work together in  going the air. Neither one was that great alone.
 This thing is a beast. I live in a small 1 bedroom apartment in New York with no air conditioning. The ultimate test: high 70's outside, window open, sun beaming in, zero wind... I turned this thing on and in 10 minutes I was chilled. Not only that, but it is super quiet for it's size and power. I'm a very light sleeper and I could easily sleep/nap with this in the same room. I was a little startled by how tall it was, probably because I didn't read the description thoroughly enough. I'm 5'8" &amp; this comes to about my ribs. But even so, it is still aesthetically pleasing and it fits nicely in the corner. And it doesn't scare my cats, which is a bonus.
 Amazing fan - I read a review that said how "cool" the air felt but couldn't believe it until I felt it for myself!  It really moves air.  It is also very tall.  The noise is just perfect white noise for sleeping.  We gave up the noise machine.  My husband and I are both sleeping so much better.  (There are 3 levels if you want it quieter/slower).<br/>The remote control takes AAA batteries and fits into a cute little slot in the top of the unit for storage.<br/>The only drawback is that the blue Ion light is very bright - I just put some electrical tape over this area.  You could also turn this off for night I guess.<br/>Got a second one for my son's room : )<br/>I am tempted to buy a third fan but when they are at the door and on oscillate they move enough air for the entire floor - that's one on each level, so I don't really need another.
 We ordered 3 of these fans because the A/C needed help keeping our house cool in this FL summer heat as well as the need to replace very old fans. We decided to put 2 in each bedroom and the 3rd one in the living room. I love that they are on the quieter side and don't have to blast the TV to hear over top of it, even on High. They also come with a remote so the hubs can use it while on the couch and the fan is across the room.<br/><br/>Lasko has always been a favorite of ours and have bought their fans in the past. We have what we call the wind tunnel in our room, so these new fans are MUCH quieter compared to that one. This fan is also lightweight and easy to move around the house, especially since it has a handle on the back near the top.<br/><br/>The air flow is decent and has helped keep the bedrooms some degrees cooler. One bedroom has an alarm clock with an indoor/outdoor temp display. That room could get to 83 degrees in the middle of the day. This fan has helped get it down to 78 most days.<br/><br/>This specific model has different options, including:<br/><br/>* 3 Speeds<br/>* Oscillator<br/>* Timer<br/>* Ionizer<br/><br/>Overall, we are happy with our purchase and have no complaints so far.
 Here are the tower fans I tried and compared before settling on this fan<br/><br/>Honeywell Fresh Breeze Tower Fan with Remote Control, HY-048BP<br/><br/>Dyson Air Multiplier AM07 Tower Fan, Black<br/><br/>Lasko 2551 Wind Curve Platinum Tower Fan With Remote Control and Fresh Air Ionizer<br/><br/>Lasko 2554 (this fan for which I am posting review)<br/><br/>About me (So that you know what are my priorities when i look at a fan)<br/><br/>2554 is a clear winner. Why<br/>1. Doesn't make noise (very little compared all others i compared with). Honeywell makes noise especially when the fan oscillates. It won't let you sleep if you are particular about noise. Dyson is very quiet but only upto level 2 (it can go from 1-10). You practically have to turn dyson to level 7-8 because the speed of blowing air is too less and you still have to keep the fan close to yourself to get good air. A complete failure in design. Looks great though (like many other things, looks great but doesn't do it's job). I have seen 2551 Lasko and it is not even close to Lasko 2251 noise level. and too tall<br/>2. You can still have 2551 at max speed level and feel comfortable about the amount of breeze you get. Ideall you have keep the fan at level 2 and you won't even feel it<br/>3. You can keep 2551 6-10 ft away from and have the fan at level 3 and not worry about noise. Level 2 good enough and level 3 is probably needed on 100 degree days.<br/><br/>Bad part<br/>1. To use the remote, you really have to have a direct angle to the front top of the fan. Else the remote may or may not work.<br/>2. As other people have answered in Q&amp;A, it doesn't oscillate much. but you can avoid the problem by keeping the fan away from you and that way the fan can cover a larger area. Moot point but good to know.<br/><br/>Why 5 stars and not 4 - there are so many bad fans out there that i would say lasko did a great job with this fan. overall a winner. deserves a 5 in this crowded market.
 The fan works well.  The remote needs a redesign.  The clip on the remote that's used to secure it to the fan prevents the remote from laying flat on a surface.  It's usually on my nightstand, and I'm worried that it'll actually scratch the wood.  You also have to point the remote directly at the fan, which is an annoyance.  If they redesign the remote, they'll have a great product on their hands.
 This fan is AWESOME!  The first time I turned it on, it seemed weak; I don't know if it needed to "settle in" or something, but now I've used it on all three settings and they're all great - even the first setting works well!<br/><br/>It also looks great and I don't know which fan people got who say it's noisy - THIS fan is very, very quiet on settings 1 and 2, and low (like soothing "white noise") on setting 3.<br/><br/>I totally love this fan!  It's also priced well.
 My bedroom might as well have no insulation at all. For those of y’all who live in the South, you know how hot it can get. This fan really cools down the bedroom in just a few minutes. Best money I’ve ever spent! For those complaining about the blue light, some tape over the bulb will solve all of your problems.

The issue I have is that this fan has gotten louder over time. I'm not sure if its the bearings in the motor or the motor itself, but the fan produces an annoyingly loud hum that reverberates throughout the room. I've attached a video that captures the sound a bit.<br/><br/>While I typically don't mind a bit of fan noise, the noise with the fan I received is just too excessive.
 Seems to be a good fan but missing some of the screws...seemed to be a repackaged item! Perhaps s return.? Bought as a new item so not too happy with this purchase...Also the remote does not work at all! Tried 6 different sets of batteries. Nothing
 THIS IS THE BEST EVER FAN! I would give it a 10 if I could. We set it up in our den. It is so quiet, I hardly know it's  there. Quiet is the most important to me. But I  will go further. It distributes the air evenly!. Loved it so much I purchased one more for our daughter's  room. Sturdy, did I say quiet, easy to put together. QUALITY fan. Did I say quiet!!!!
 Some tower fans blow (in a bad way).  This is not one of those.  In fact, this is the baddest (in a good way) tower fan I have encountered life-to-date.  Oscillates.  Strong output.  Air ioniser.  Aesthetically pleasing.  That's about as good as it gets for a fan without rigging it up to an air compressor, an evaporator, a couple other things, and installing it in a big box in your window.
 I bought this fan to replace the high velocity Lasko.  This one is pretty quiet, but doesn't blow hard enough.  I'm hoping it doesn't break apart like the high velocity one.  The reason I don't like this one is when you push the ionize or rotate button, every time you turn it on you have to push them again.  Why can't it just remember that it was pushed before?
 I'm in my 30's and have never had a fancy Dan like this. 1) It HAS A REMOTE!!! 2) It has the right amount of white noise I need, it's not super quiet but I like that about this fan. I grew up in my Grammy's house and it made so much noise at night creeking and cracking ( old house) that I can't sleep without some white noise to calm me down. I like the Ionizer feature, I don't like how bright the blue light is but oh well. I love the timer on it too. It's a big plus that it doesn't have regular blades. I'm happy with it.
 The Lasko 42" Wind Curve fan has worked fine for me for the last 3 months.  I normally wait longer to try out a product before reviewing it, but I thought I would give others a heads up.  The biggest complaint I have with this fan is that when you turn it on, you have to reset the settings each time.  If you prefer a certain speed or want it to swivel, you will have to go through each of the settings one by one until you get to it.  It would be SO much easier if it could remember your settings (aka, Fan Speed - Low and Oscillating) or just turn on to the last settings performed.<br/>As far as the fan pressure goes, I'd say it's fair to low.  If you're looking for a fan with a lot of pressure, this ain't it.  The noise, while it's not overly loud, I would not say that it is particularly quiet either, and I found the breeze function to be annoying with the whistling noise coming and going.<br/>I also think the "cooling" is a bit of a gimmick.  I can not see any advantage to it.  If you're looking for a basic fan, this will work, but I would not buy it for the selling points it tries to hit on.
 It's okay.  Just okay.  It's tall.  It only oscillates between about a 20 degree angle.  I do like that it is very quite.  I'm not sure though how much air it is actually moving.  I don't know if the $300 Dyson is that much better but at least this is quieter than the old box fans.  If the packaging could be put back together, I'd probably send it back since it isn't great but the internal packaging had so much tape on the thin plastic there is no way to put this back together.
 This fan is a life saver.  I have become very hot blooded as I get older and waking up in the middle of the night and having to get out of bed to turn on the fan and turn it back off didn't help with my sleep.  This fan is wonderful.  I keep the remote control on my night stand and when I wake up hot I just click that button and cool off, then I click it off.  The air feels really cooler coming out of this fan than just the normal round fans.  It may just be in my mind, but it is great.  It is very quiet as well.  Great investment.
 Okay, I just bought 2 more of these fans, just in case they realize...they last too long and should probably cost a lot more.  I would have bought them at 99.99!  Got my first one probably 5 years ago or more and we used it between our 2 lazy boys on oscillate...It was perfect.  Then we redecorated and don't sit as closely, but they hardly take up any room, so I got one more, one for each.<br/><br/>Today I realized, why keep the good ones in the living room and fight over the filthy black plastic ones in the family room...well I got us each one for that room.<br/><br/>I tell ya, one fan, on the lowest setting, by the side of your chair, will make the hottest room cool!  Now we can be comfy in both areas.<br/><br/>And don't forget, they run silent (well, almost) like a submarine!
 This fan is finally being put through it's paces with temperatures hitting ninety. It works quite well, blows out cool air. With lower temperatures, I sometimes have to turn it away from me slightly, or I get too cold. It's not too noisy either, which is nice while watching TV. The reason I knocked off a star is that it doesn't really cool down a room, even a small bedroom. It will cool down the area it's targetted at and that's it. So it doesn't work as well as I'd like for my bedroom, but works nicely to cool down a couple of spots on the couch in the living room.
 Works as it should...but, I wish it blew cold air during the really hot days.  It seems like it just blows around the hot air in the room (and I know there is really no way to get cold air to blow, being that it isn't an actual 'air-conditioner').  When it isn't too hot in the house it works perfectly, keeping the room(s) at a comfortable temperature.  ::::I guess my next investment will have to be a new place (with an air conditioner as an added feature)::::<br/>Not sure how the Fresh-Air-IONizer is supposed to work (I haven't noticed a difference in the air when that function is on).<br/>I have NOT had a use for the remote control yet; however, I have used the timer function a few times...when we leave the house on a hot day (and I don't want to leave the fan running the entire time), I will usually set the timer for the max (4 hours) to continue running after the sun goes down, in an attempt to cool the place down a bit before we return home.  Depending on what time we leave the house, sometimes it helps...sometimes it is just as useless as it is during the HOT days =/ !!<br/>I opted for the 2-year warranty, just In case...<br/>*I would recommend this fan to others.*
 This is my 4th Lasko fan - they are in several rooms in my home.  I find Lasko to be the most reliable, durable, long lasting fans at a reasonable price compared to many others.  This one has a beautiful wood grain finish that accents the other wood in my home so it is fitting nicely into the living room.  It is quite powerful yet quiet so it is a welcome addition to the room.  It was a great buy for the money!
 1st item was returned, remote did not work. If not for the problems I had on the phone would of rated higher but had to hurdle over language barriers and very bad information from representative at customer services.<br/> As for the fan it moves the air very nice and I keep it on low. I do wish it was quieter. On low its not to bad but on med or high it roars. Set up was easy and fast.
 From other reviews, I was not expecting to be giving 5 stars.  However, we are pleased that the fan came while we were still having hot weather so that we could try it out, and it really does the job for our purposes.  Some said it was not quiet enough--we thought it was very quiet and had no problem hearing the TV or conversation when it was in the same room.  I like the features that it has and we have used them all and think we got a good product for the price.  If it lasts a year, we will be even more happy.  I would recommend this brand and model to any of our friends.
 I wasn't sure this cleaner was going to do what I hoped.  I was very surprised, and pleased to find features I didn't even see.  The fan is very powerful, which was unexpected for the price.  The timer has 5 settings so you can turn it off in 1/2 hour increments up to 4 hours.  6 screws to put the whole thing together, so under a minute.  The 180 degree swivel is great, not sure how long it will last if you run it full time.  I got this to clean out a musky smell I had in son's room.  Had tried airing out everything, including his matress, and could not do it.  Within 1 day, there was a HUGE difference.  I got 2, 1 for that room and one for the living room, have 1 cat and a bigger Dog, and when he's wet, you smell dog.  This fixed that up quick.  I don't normally write reviews, but had a friend over who liked it so much, I ended up selling both of mine to him and ordering 2 more.
 My upstairs does not cool as the lower house.  I like it cooler.  2 separate fans in the bedroom still did not provide enough for m best rest so I tried this.  It's a fan people.  It is not an air conditioner. Some reviews make it sound like such.  That said, it does cool better than a regular fan but not drastically.  I like it.  I love the remote and the aesthetics.  I do recommend!  Very easy to set up.
 -used it for 2 season now (july 2018 update)<br/>-compared to my - Bionaire® 42'' Remote Control Tower Fan (BT440RC-CN), The Lasko is more quiet.  However my generic $30-40 oscillating floor fan was still MUCH quieter.  The Lasko did have better wind stream of course.<br/>-it served my purpose but in terms of quietness it's COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on what your comparing to in your home.  Nobody can fully answer this question for you.  my 2 cents on this is that you will hear it at night when you sleep.  I wouldn't consider the lowest setting to be "loud" category nor is it whisper quiet either.<br/>-VERY small radius - wish it could go further<br/>-its tall but feels sturdy.
 So I have only 1 A/C unit in my  750sq ft] Miami apartment and it was a horrible A/C unit. I spent some time researching fans and came across this one.<br/><br/>I set it up in my living room to help move the air around and to help the A/C that is in my bedroom. It helps.. A lot more than expected. I actually not only feel cool, but I sometimes feel cold when the air is blowing on me which would never happen with the living room ceiling fan on high.<br/><br/>It has an "ion" feature which I have yet to use. But just as a fan it is amazing. I love the oscillation, the look, and the remote. It is also extremely quiet. It is quite large, but not overly so.
 Only used once to try as still not that hot in NY.  Definitely more powerful than the previously owned tower fans.  You can actually feel the air blowing.  Also bought the Lasko 4930 High velocity.  That one is more powerful than Lasko 2551 in terms of air output however Lasko 2551 is quieter.  So going to put this in bedroom and the high velocity 4930 in the living room/kitchen area.  Hope it helps the air conditioning bill go down some.  Problem however with the FEDEX delivery used.  Live in apartment building, package was delivered but don't know to who.  Amazon fixed though by sending replacement using USPS.  It would help to have a reliable shipment method that uses signature confirmation otherwise UPS and FEDEX are not always reliable.
 We got this fan about a month ago to try and deal with the rising temperatures and unbearable humidity of NYC summers. Let me just preface by saying that nothing beats a proper AC put in the room, fans won't cut it when the summer really hits full force. But for now, it has been a very welcomed breeze in our room that alleviates our sweaty suffering overnight - and as others have mentioned here it has a surprisingly cool feeling coming out of it, particularly when the ionizer mode is on (could also just be psychological honestly, but I sensed a slight difference). Only thing I wished it could do better is have a wider angle of oscillating - only about 90° give or take. And also not sure why the clearly false claim on the product description: electronic timer has only 4 options between 0.5 and 4 hours, not 7.5
 Fan model is defective, they put little metal clips on one of the fan blades near the top that makes a ton of noise &amp; glue it on and it stinks.
 Now, this is a pretty nice size fan was not too hard to put together puts out good air flow and tall enough it puts out pretty good air flow too I also like that is has Fresh Air Ionizer too! I liked the fact it was made of medal not plastic some fans are harder to put together this one did not have alot to put it together just followed instructions and it was up and running you can use the buttons on the fan or remote I have not used the remote because you will need AAA batteries and it did not come with those so I just use the buttons on top of the fan enjoy!
 I'm one of those people that has to have a fan on when going to sleep. This fan is powerful, but not as much as I was expecting. If it wouldn't have cost $12 to return this fan I would have done so and bought a "wind machine" fan instead. it works well though for general purposes, my apartment just gets really warm because the cold air doesn't make it to my room.
 I have tried a number of fans including ceiling fans, box fans, vornado, stand fans and the GoWise pedestal fan with temperature readout.  I like this Lasko best.  It is the quietest and creates a gentle soothing breeze that feels quite fresh.  The breeze feels better to me than the others. I use the ionizer sometimes but I have no idea if it really offers any benefit,  I did not give it a 5 simply because when the fan oscillates the airflow is not always on you.  To try to address that, I bought a second Lasko for a large great room and will have them in opposite corners oscillating out of synch so I will feel the gentle breeze more continuously.  I hope it works.  But if not, I needed it anyway for the dining area in the great room.
 I got this for a combination of a cooling breeze and white noise to help me sleep. The breeze part is fine - in fact I think this is a terrific fan that is more practical and rattles less than a traditional box fan.<br/><br/>For use at night, however, there are some serious drawbacks. The sound it makes is very high-pitched, and is more annoying than soothing (that's subjective). But the worst part is the super-bright LEDs, especially the blue "ionize" light. The lights are so bright you can almost read by them, and so using this in a dark room at night will require covering them with electrical tape or something, which blocks the sensor for the remote.<br/><br/>There is very little difference in pitch and volume between the three settings, and I don't feel a signifiant airflow change either, but the higher speed does help quell some of the plastic rattling from the inside of the fan. The first one I received I had to send back because the rattling was so bad, and the second one was much better. Still, at night the slight rattling or clicking is annoying, but for daytime use it's easily ignored.
 I love my new Lasco tower Ion fan. It has powerful airflow on just the 'low' setting. It has smooth, strong, breeze-like air movement. The oscillation doesn't reach 180 degrees, but really it oscillates enough.. It (the strong air flow) reaches all the way across the room w/NO problem on the Low setting. I also like knowing it has the Ion air cleaner. I use it often..<br/>I would buy it again &amp; I recommend this fan.. very happy😊
 We love our fan!!!!! It's quiet enough and moves air through the bedroom nicely. I'm a year round fan person (all seasons, all weather's) there is something about a nice breeze while I'm sleeping that I just love! It's got 3 speeds, it's oscillating and has an ionizer in it. The only down side is that the remote it comes with has to be pointing directly at the front of the fan to work, so sometimes I might as well have just got up and hit the button, but it's nice to have and we enjoy it very much.
 This fan is beautiful, functional, &amp; quiet.You don't have to turn the TV up to hear it.  I like that you can set a timer, my husband loves that theres a remote. I like that there is a spot for the remote on the unit so my children don't loose it, and I don't have to listen to my husband yell "wheres the remote." This fan is powerful. I can set it on low 20 feet from my couch and still feel it. I like that I don't have to worry about little ones loosing a finger like the box blade fans. I like that its purifying my air as it works.<br/>I was originally worried about the size, 42 inches, and the sturdiness, I thought it would for sure get knocked over by my boys but so far so good. its not wobbly at all.
 I needed a fan with a small footprint and this is great.  Love the timer, and the ionizer seems to improve the air somewhat.  Remote is nice, and it cools my smaller room nicely.  Update to my review.  I've had this fan about 2 months, and one day it wouldn't turn on.  I contacted Lasko, and they agreed to replace the fan, but not until I cut the cord off, and mail it to them.  Then allow 2 weeks for processing.  So I'm without a fan in the middle of summer time for  3 weeks?  I could go to Home Depot today and be sleeping comfortable with my fan tonight, instead I have to wait, and for 60. dollars that not really acceptable service.  I recently had an issue with another Item I purchased, when I called, they apologized and sent me a replacement express.  Had it in two days.  Now that's customer service.  LASKO, you have something to learn about keeping your customers coming back.  Quality, long lasting products, and good customer service are the key.
 This fan is a beast!  I have a 550 sq ft studio that this is perfect for.  It can cool down the entire room and really feels like it's circulating the air.  I very much appreciate the ion air purifying feature since I have very bad spring time allergies.  The remote control is a nice added feature.
 I've had mine for a couple years now, and it's slowing down noticeably. I'm guessing I will have to replace it soon.<br/><br/>I've also noticed that they don't make this fan easy to clean - there is no easy way to disassemble it to get to the fan blades, where I think a lot of dust is being collected. This no doubt contributes to the fan slowing down.<br/><br/>I still really like this fan, and I would consider buying it again. It definitely pushes a lot of air, and the ION feature that cleans your air does make a difference. All, in all, I'm glad I bought it.
 This is a very expensive looking ionizer. I saw one in town a whole lot more expensive and not as tall. It circulates the air really well. I use it at the end of a family room and it blows throughout the entire room into the kitchen area. It is good to move air conditioning around the room. It looks really good! The remote keeps me from getting up and it has a timer too, 3 speeds, it ocillates and of course the ionizer. It was simple to put together - just set in the bottom and insert screws.
 So far, so good. Fan arrived today; a day earlier than anticipated. Base went together quickly - could have done it but hubby had it out of the box before I got that close. The thing that took the longest was actually finding the screws for the base but in less than 10 minutes it was up and running. Very quiet which was what I'd hoped for.  "Quiet" and "Oscillating"  with at least three speeds was what I was looking for - a plus is that there is a remote. Completely missed that there is ionization with this unit, too.  Since it has only been running 10 minutes, will post more if any issues crop up in the future.<br/><br/>Just be aware that the two triple-A batteries required for the remote are NOT included...but as of now, I'd have to recommend this fan.
 The fact that it swivels is a plus, better distribution of air around a room.<br/>Looks nice enough to be in a living room.<br/><br/>Could not get remote to work on the first try. Have not had time to try again since but will.<br/>The base is fragile, thin plastic, and could easily be cracked or broken if the fan were to be dropped or knocked over.
 I have owned one of these for almost 4 years. The air flowing from it always feels cooler than the air flowing from other fans and runs extremely quiet compared to my vornado and box fans.<br/><br/>The newer version is not as quiet as the older, however, still quieter than box fans and the vornado I have. They circulate a lot more cool air. I am still trying to figure out where the cool air is coming from.<br/><br/>I will always purchase Lasko fans. Their quiet and coolness is unbeatable.
 This fan is actually one of the most sought out makes AND model. I just replaced one that worked for 7 years with the exact same one. The older one had an annoying loud beep when you turned it on or off and the newer one did away with all of that. THE BEST FAN I have ever used EVER. I have to have one when I sleep that creates enough of a breeze that I can feel it but not a windstorm that blows the covers. This fan is the sweet spot of both and Lasko really outdid themselves with this model. Whenever this one goes out, I will replace it again with the exact same one. Love love love love LOVE IT!
 Living in a 650 sqft studio, I think this fan does a great job in pushing air throughout my apartment. The white noise on Level 2 fan is pretty low and my cat, who sleeps right next to it, dozes off in comfort - so I know it's not that loud.<br/><br/>It takes up very little room, took about 15 mins to assemble by myself and I'm a small person so it was a little tricky to get the tower onto the base. Once up though, it never wobbles as it oscillates, so it's great. I've had it for about a 1.5 months and works great so far. I can leave it on all day and still works amazingly well.<br/><br/>But if you live in a drier area like Los Angeles, might want to consider a humidifier as the air rips out moisture and can leave you with dry lips and higher potential for bloody noses. Otherwise, great purchase!
 The Lasko 2554 is a capable fan in that it outputs a fairly large volume of air at three speeds, with the extra amenities of oscillation, timing until shut-off, and an ion air freshener.<br/><br/>What is unfortunate is how plastic and weak this fan feels. Even during normal oscillation, the fan will occasionally creek and groan under the top-heavy weight of design. This also leads to a slight wobble that does not appear to affect its oscillation, though after months or years of operation, it may come into play.<br/><br/>After years of listening to an old box fan hum away, this fan has a much higher pitch in comparison.<br/><br/>This is still a solid fan, though questions of longevity remain to be tested.
 I was very careful about purchasing a fan.  I don't have air conditioning, and regretted it last summer. I have one old fan I "inherited" that is a Lasko and works very well.  I read every single review out there before I purchased this one, and the fact that it is a Lasko sealed the deal.  It looks very nice and is a lot taller than my old one.  That's the plus.  However, it isn't very powerful.  My lowest setting on my old Lasko is the highest setting on the new one.  Very disappointed.  I was thinking I'd be getting the same power and it would be almost the same as having AC.  It is quieter than my old one, so if that is important to you, then this might be a good fit.
 I purchased two of these fans this past summer when the large fan we'd had for a decade died.  One unit is in my bedroom, the other is in the living room.  That unit helps push cool air from the AC unit down the hallway.  These work so well that we were able to reduce the AC set point by 5 degrees.  While they are fairly quiet, they are not silent.  My one and only complaint is the light indicating that the unit is on is so bright it illuminates my entire bedroom at night.  I throw a black sock over it at night - that does the trick.<br/><br/>Overall, a great purchase.<br/><br/>UPDATE - 08/02/2016: Purchased a third unit for the second bedroom/office.  It came in two days - in fact, Amazon tracking says it's still on its way.  Couldn't be happier with this model!
 I loved it the first month. Then it just started to make a high pitched noise. I got it to aid my sleep, now the machine whirling noise is bugging me. If it's brand new, why is it making whirling machine noise already the second month I use it? Also, the remote is a joke. You have to stand in front of it no more than 3 feet away for the remote control to actually control the fan. Ahhhhh... why can't these big brand fan makers be more honest and spend a little bit extra to make their product last longer and worth the price? Stop making your products in China seriously. If it;s made in china, this shall be sold at half of the list price.
 For $30 (like new), this was a great buy.  However, it's a much tougher call for full price.<br/><br/>The oscillation is decent - it's smooth and steady, but it only oscillates through 60-75 degrees.  That's probably adequate for most people, but a 90 deg oscillation would have been better for me.<br/><br/>The power of the fan is decent, but it certainly doesn't rival some fans' strength that I've seen.  If you're going to use the fan for your bedroom, it should be fine.  If you're trying to circulate air through a large living room, though, it's going to be on the weak side.<br/><br/>The ionization, while a nice touch, doesn't seem to do a whole lot, but maybe the placebo effect is enough to justify having the feature :)  If I expect to be breathing fresher air, there's gotta be some value in that alone!<br/><br/>If you can get the fan used at a price closer to $30, definitely don't hesitate to make the buy.  However, for $60 or so, I'd consider other similarly-priced tower fans and check what those reviews say.
 I read alot of reviews on here that this fan is weak, etc. etc. But for my needs, that being a small room with poor AC air flow and with lots of equipment that generates heat, it does the job quite nicely! I love the remote. Very fast response time, I was very impressed.<br/><br/>And no, the Ionizer light does not bother me, it is not blinding and the light stays off when not activated. For those who had to go the extremes of duck taping the light to mask the brightness must live under rock and is sensitive to any light. Lastly, as for the "clicking" noise that comes about when the fan oscillates, if you install the fan correctly and use common sense you won't run into that problem. I myself found out why that could have occurred. I am very familiar with technology and equipment in general so it was nothing to put together for me. I have not ran into the clicking problem. I installed the base correctly and it oscillates fine. In closing, the fan is perfect for small rooms and blows out an exceptional amount of air. It wont blow you away, but it won't feel like a battery-powered handheld fan either.
 This fan would be great if it actually STAYED in the STAND! It is constantly falling over due to poor design and the fan level randomly switches to higher speeds, even when there is nothing around the fan. So for someone like me who sleeps with the fan on, the inconsistent fan speeds and the alarming, random THUMP in the middle of the night for the fan tipping over are two very unfortunate issues.
 So far this has been an amazing fan! I wouldn't say it is silent - it sounds like a fan but is MUCH quieter than a box fan. I like to have the room cold when I sleep so I normally keep the central air running - even in the winter - but the house was getting too cold at night for the pipes so we decided to get a fan. Definitely will get this fan again if we decide we need another for the guest room.
 Great fan and love the fact that it has a remote.....;makes it prefect!
 Had one of these for a year now and no problems at all. Best fan I ever purchased. Quiet. Love this fan and the features, 3 speeds, oscillates (or not), timer with 15 settings, Ionizer option and a remote to control it whilst cooling off. Much more stable than the old wobbly fan on a stand and doesn't take up much space. I like this Lasko fan so much I just ordered two more. Totally recommend this product.
 Ordered this based on the positive reviews and were not disappointed.  It moves a lot of air without much fuss.  The remote control is surprisingly useful and I'm glad we have it.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that it does not remember it has been in oscillate mode when it's powered off, so you have to reset that mode every time.  At least it does remember its fan speed setting.<br/><br/>Not really sure what the ION filter does, or is supposed to do.  It makes no noise and no perceptable difference in the performance of the fan.  Just shines a pretty blue light when it't in that mode.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the fan shipped without the screws required to bolt on the pedestal base.  We are at the hardware store all the time, anyway, so $0.25 worth of screw purchase didn't spoil my day, but really.  They might have included those.  Especially since they are a weird metric size and if you didn't know about metric bolts it would be tricky to get the right ones.
 I thought about giving it one star due to the fact that it DIDN'T COME WITH SCREWS. There's only one real instruction for this thing. Screw the base plate onto the fan. But they didn't provide any screws! Luckily I had my own and I was able to attach it.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say it's exactly loud, but ain't quiet either. I had just spent the weekend at a buddy's house and he happened to have the Lasko #2554 42-Inch Wind Curve Fan with Remote. That seemed quieter to me. If I had to do it over again I'd have bought that instead. But considering the hassle of a return I'll just keep this. If you're debating between those two, get the #2554.<br/><br/>Maybe it will even come with screws.
 I started with one of these to replace my ancient dying fan.  I loved it so much that I have now bought one for multiple rooms in my house and for my parents.  The remote works nicely.  It blows air quietly, rotates quietly and takes up very little space.  I bought my first one 4 years ago and it's still working well (with lots of use...I don't have AC).
 Great fan if you want to get a breeze in a room and cool it down just a bit. We have one AC unit in our three story townhome where the control is on the main floor. We didn't want to turn the AC down any lower but the upstairs is just so much warmer than the rest of the house. Sleeping at night started to become miserable but after ordering this fan it has been perfect. It isn't the quietest fan in the world so there is some noise but we actually like the background noise it gives. The fan was very easy to put together as well... Says my wife. She had it all assembled and in the bedroom by the time I got home from work (which must mean it's easy to put together which is a plus!).
 Lasko tower fans are wonderful but there were two major flaws with this unit.<br/><br/>1. Makes a loud buzzing or humming noise at any speed. Noise only stops when the fan is tilted on a angle.<br/>2. The blue "Ion" LED is so bright it can be seen from outer space.<br/><br/>These two issues made it impossible to operate while sleeping. Would probably be okay for a room where you do not require total darkness or quiet.<br/><br/>Swapped it for a different model Lasko.
 My second lasko wind curve, just a different color.  It's the best-I plan on purchasing a third.
 I bought this fan to replace an older Lasko upright that bought the farm earlier this summer.  We always have one in our family room during the summer months.  It really makes a difference and allows me to turn the air conditioner back some.  The first one arrived DOA, apparently damaged during shipping.  Amazon immediately shipped a second one and it arrived the next day.  They also made the arrangements with UPS to pick up the damaged one a day later for return.  Their buy and/or return system is amazingly efficient.<br/>As for the fan, it works fine.  It's plenty quiet and throws plenty of air around the room.  I don't know if the air ionizer mode aids in cleaning the air or not but that's not what I bought it for.  Am extremely happy with the purchase.
 Works incredibly well. Yes, it makes a little noise, but so does a ceiling or any fan.  The lights on the front are the only drawback. Especially the Ionization light. A crazy bright blue that is not conducive to sleep. Put a piece of black tape over it, done.
 This is a game-changer. In the heat of summer I found myself carrying this from room to room with me. It moves air well without being too loud.  It is taller than I imagined, but that's ok. It's still easy to move. The air feels cool and refreshing.  The remote and oscillation are amazing. I really love the shut-off timer. I set it before bed so the fan shuts if after the temperatures get low. I no longer scramble for the blanket in the middle of a night. It's great!
 I just received this last night, Sept 27th, from Seller Frozen Lemon. They processed and shipped my order fast!<br/> I had originally ordered this item on Sept 8th from seller Portable Guy, who after 2 weeks had not even shipped it, and when I contacted them I got an auto response that they were going on vacation! Wow! So...note to other buyers. Frozen Lemon is a great seller, take your chances with Portable Guy.<br/>The Fan: it's super quiet, has an ionizer that helps clean the air, rotates, multi-speed, and comes with a remote. This is super handy, as I like the fan on medium or high, but when we want to watch something on TV, we generally turn it down to low so it's at its quietest. Also, having the remote next to my chair, it's handy for turning the fan. All I do is hit the Oscillate button and redirect the fan.<br/>Great fan...highly recommend it.
 We bought two of these about 16 months ago; we used them for 5 months, stored them for 5, and then used them for 6 months.  When used, they are used 16-24 hours a day.<br/><br/>One of them is now making a loud clicking noise when it's on, so it's on lite duty and I don't expect it to last to next summer.<br/><br/>Nothing lasts forever though, and one is still totally fine, so I suppose we've gotten our money out of them.
 We bought two of these to support a compact A/C unit in our backyard apartment and they are fabulous.  They put out great consistent air, are tall enough to hit you when sleeping and are super quiet, but do give just enough white noise for those of us who love the sound of a quiet ceiling fan.  Highly recommend this product and the price is spot on.
 My house has vaulted ceilings, no fans, and I like air movement.  I figured this could be a nice substitution for a ceiling fan.  It really has been nice, as far as moving air around.  My issue with this product is the noises it makes.  This fan has a "back and forth" setting, and everytime it gets the end of the arc, it makes a noticable (almost buzzing?) sound.  As long as I am watching television, or doing anything else that creates noise, I don't really notice it.  However, I can't be in the room with this fan if the only other sound is me reading a book, it drives me crazy.
