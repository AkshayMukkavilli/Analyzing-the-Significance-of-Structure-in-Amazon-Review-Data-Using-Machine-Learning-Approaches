iPhone 6s Plus case being sold as 7 plus
Great Case.
Does NOT Fit iPhone 7 Plus
Doesn’t fit 8+ properly
This case is amazing and the seller is top notch
This is a very good case for the money paid for it
Premium Protection at a Great Price!
Sorry Rocky, but you asked for my review
Great case after a little modification but not so good right out of the box.
Package received is not made for iPhone 8plus
Exactly what I ordered. Product was reasonable and came ...
CHEAP WORTHLESS CASE !!
Great sturdy case
DO NOT BUY
Great case for 8plus
No military I know of would consider this Zizo (Bolt Series) "Military Grade"
Happy customer !
Good decision!
Good quality, same as higher price cases.
THE BEST HEAVY DUTY IPHONE COVER
Items defective despite of Amazon "Inspected" orange sticker.
Well....it’s ok-ish
Does not work on 7plus. Depresses power button permanently ...
It has an extremely poor fit when you also use a tempered glass screen protector like it's designed to use.
Rugged and tough feel to this case.
Bolt Beep
Okay case- NOT very good glass
Cool looking
Cheap quality.  “Wish.com” like.
Belt Clip is not practical
Cheaply-Made Product Lacking Quality
RUN OVER BY A CAR and it still works !
"I'm over here!!!"  w/ UPDATE
Great Buy!
Bad fit, very uncomfortable to put phone , will not recommend.
Are you tired of looking at an unbroken iPhone screen? Then look no further!
Belt clip is flimsy. volume control unpredictable
The best looking case I have ever had for a phone!
... 7 Plus in December 2016 and I was very happy after trying two other cases which I ended up ...
fits my 7 plus
Liner parts do not line up, and...
The clip broke off after a month and a half of use
Cheap material and not really a good phone case.
Use to be better! Great case but clip broke after first use!
Superior quality and engineering, easy to install tempered glass, solid, secure functional belt clip that I broke
Poor Durability, And Design
Not bad, but misleading
This seemed like a good case
Appropriate to iPh-8+ & Allows Wireless Charging.
Has a design flaw that breaks easily.
You'll love ithis well made case and all of its features... especially at this price.
This is my second one! I really like it!
Absolutely the BEST case!
Really great looking and functional.
Perfect case, well made and the price is unbeatable
... purchased this for my husband's phone and he really liked it however
A clever marketing description, no near what I was expecting
POORLY CONSTRUCTED KICKSTAND
No customer support, glass cracked already
Broken after less then 2 months use, without even falling!
Fantastic case. Comporable to the much more expensive Otter Box
Sturdy, grippy, plenty of protection and soft to the touch
Bad customer service
Good quality.
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! "CERTIFIED" GARBAGE!
POS...learned to hate this thing.
Excellent case / holster combo
Great for the price!
Excellent to grip phone case
Kick stand super case!
this is not a iPhone 7 plus case
Would not recommend
Great iPhone 7 Plus case!
Piece of garbage
You get what you pay for...wouldn’t recommend to my worst friend.
PIECE OF CRAP! DON’T BUY
It Makes a Large Phone Easy to Handle
Fantastic phone protection
I am glad I tried this case out
Avoid cheap knock-offs
Easy to assemble
I wanted to like this case
NOT for iPhone 8 plus!!!!
Incredibly difficult to put on over your phone
Best case I've seen. Great quality , great price.
Durable case but very tight fitting for iphone 8 plus.
Great case, sub par customer service
Highly Disappointed. Poorly made case (IPhone 7+)
Good case crappy kick stand
Not for everyone
If only I had a 7 plus it might be a 5 star review
Good quality product.
Please read all..
i really like the case
6 Months In, the Kickstand Falls Apart
Good case with good features...but fades fast
I love the case
Durable case, textured for more gription.
mainly too bulky
All most perfect case
Case buttons stiff but easily fixed with an exacto knife
I like this one the best for the grip and aesthetics
Best protective case for the money
Difficult/clumsy to use
Waste of money
wrong size but a great case
I love it except for 1 big problem...
Rebranded iPhone 6 Plus case that is falling apart with less than a month of use
Belt clip be gone. Plastic cover not reversible.
I was immediately disappointed when I first used it
Can't put my phone to sleep!
Fits iPhone 7 + perfectly
I bought this 10/16/16
Almost a win, but...
Great for protection, but don't expect it to be warrantied.
So glad I picked this one
Not Military tough!! Poor warranty!
Impact protection not good.

Its ok
Impressive material quality, buttons didn’t work
I am SO happy with my choice
Well worth the price.

Tough and sturdy without bulk
Nice case for someone who is rough with their phone
Great case!
Great Product!
My friend bought one of these and I liked it well enough to buy one for myself
Highly recommended for accident-prone people.
I tried the Zizo case once because of the slim fit and bold colors unlike the Bulky dull colors Otter Box
Absolutely amazing
This case is pretty much useless
I would use it full time if it were more durable like my Otterbox Defender
Kickstand Structural Failure
Solid product. Give it a try!

Estoy decepcionado
Wrong size label. Cheap manufacturing.
Zizo iPhone 7 Plus is a nice product but needs improvement.
Stiff stiff stiff
Cannot recommend.
my only suggestion is that the designers would add a sticker on the tempered glass cover that says something like "this side to phone face"
Bad Design, Not Convenient, Would NOT Recommend or Buy Again
