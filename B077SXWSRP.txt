 I work from home and bought the Echo Show specifically for two reasons: background movies and music to keep me company all day.  For music, yes, this is an excellent device.  The sound is loud, clear and surprisingly well-rounded.  Alexa recognizes voice commands very well in this respect.  Movies, on the other hand, are a struggle.  First, Alexa does not recognize most movie names by voice command, even ones I know are on Prime Video.  Next, if you have Alexa take you directly to Prime Video, it offers only a "lite" version of the service.  You cannot search movies well and the few categories they have stop at 60 results.  Being that I can easily stream 4-6 movies a day while working, I've already exhausted most of the good choices.  Then, for whatever reason, the audio volume on videos is 50-70% lower than music.  So in order to watch a video at arm's length away, I have to turn the volume to 1/2 at minimum, but usually 3/4.  I don't understand the massive disparity between music and movie volume.  Worse yet, if Alexa responds to a command while I'm watching a movie at that volume, her voice is two or three times louder than the movie, which is to say, obnoxiously loud.  Now, maybe I bought this for the wrong purpose.  I am never going to video call or have it control my lights, nor am I going to ask it to set an alarm or give me a recipe.  However, with the marketing claiming there are tens of thousands of commands, I was under the impression that doing something as simple as using Amazon's own video streaming service would be incredibly smooth.  Unfortunately it is not.  And like others have said, this is a touch screen after all, but there are very few things you can actually use it for.  I think I am used to the app screen on my phone I guess.  I keep expecting to be able to go to a home screen and pick what I want to do.  With no clear index of abilities, I really have no idea what I can do until I try things.  Then, after Alexa tells me she doesn't understand five or ten times, I just give up.  Last, I've gotten some errors while streaming video that claim the device's storage is full and it can no longer stream.  Well, there is no apparent way to clear the storage; streaming data should be temporarily stored and automatically replaced with new data anyway.  Because of this, I've had to restart the unit to clear the memory, which can only be done by unplugging it.  Yes, really, even with a touch screen and pull-down menu at the top, there's no restart button, you actually have to unplug it.  Decisions like these make me question who they had working on R&amp;D.  Some of these things just don't make sense.  I do think this has the potential to be a 5-star device with the hardware as-is -- the screen is very nice and the speakers sound excellent except for the volume issue.  I know not to expect the functionality of a pad or phone with a mobile OS, but I also feel very limited by the intuitiveness and functionality of the system as it is today.  Unfortunately I doubt the fixes will come before my refund eligibility expires...
 I have several of the Alexa devices (kindle, dots, spots, echo, original show) this device is different for 2 reasons, speakers and size of screen. This is a great kitchen companion. The screen is large enough to view from across the room. Before adding an ingredient to a dish, you can confirm the measurement without walking away from the stove, bowl, mixer e.t.c. It has great speakers so you can fill the room with sound as you prepare your gourmet dish. I am hesitant about putting it in the bedroom, video calling :). When I purchased my show, Amazon offered a free smart light bulb. I wish they would bring back that offer. Not that I would buy another show, but it might help others purchase one, if they were considering having a smart home.<br/><br/>The new Echo Show is a must have!!!!!!<br/><br/>I purchased my Akexa Show from an Amazon kiosk in a mall. That is why this post doesn't detail "verified purchaser".
 Edited 10/19/18: After 2 updates, the volume problem mentioned in my review is fixed. When using normal volume speech, but with the Echo volume set fairly low, Alexa now answers at a suitably low volume. And today, I was able to activate the new Whispermode, which works great! You whisper to Alexa, she whispers back to you.<br/><br/> I'm raising my rating to 4.5 stars. If Amazon would ever remove the annoying “Try this” messages ruining my home screen photo (and music screens as well), I would probably rate this as 5 stars. (This is unfortunately unlikely to happen, as Echo Show users have been complaining about this for a year and a half, but it hasn't changed.)<br/><br/>I upgraded from the first generation Echo Show. I’ll get my one real complaint out of the way first. On the second generation Show, you can lower the volume for music and videos, but not for the Alexa voice. Even with the volume set very low, so I can listen to music without disturbing anyone, if I need to interact with Alexa, her response will be very loud. This didn't happen with the first generation Echo. On that one, if I turned down the volume, everything was turned down, including Alexa. I did send feedback to Amazon about this, and I see someone else here commented on the problem. I'm eagerly awaiting the new whispermode, which isn't on my device yet, but really, I just want the voice volume to work the same way it did on the first generation.<br/><br/>I do really like the bigger screen size, which is a pleasure to watch. I'm also enjoying using the Silk browser to access YouTube. (You get to it by saying “Alexa, open Silk.” ) You can't use voice to search for YouTube videos, but if you're willing to sign into a YouTube account, you can access your saved video lists and get to the videos quickly that way. I also used the browser to access my local PBS TV station and watched some on demand video on that.
 Edit - 11/26/2018<br/><br/>Updated review after approximately six weeks of ownership with daily usage.<br/><br/>I had the first generation of this product and received this the day it was released.  I've used four of these Echo Shows daily.  I don't want to repeat the other great reviews on here so will try to add extra seven extra pieces information that may be helpful to you.<br/><br/>1) I wish Amazon and Google would band together and get over their silent feud.  I'm a huge fan of both companies (sorry Apple), but their products don't work well together.  After Amazon removed YouTube from the first generation product, I was more than upset.  Well, now you can get YouTube here via a workaround method.  You can use either Amazon's Silk Browser of the Firefox Browser on this device.  Neither works exceptionally well and I've found that Firefox works a little better, faster and with fewer hiccups.  So, you can get YouTube - just not on the YouTube native application.  It's not as good and linking your Google user account to the device and is much more difficult  to do.<br/><br/>2) It's difficult to get a Google-branded doorbell, the Nest thermostat or the Google camera to work with this device.  There are workarounds (many listed with a simple web search) that take a lot of time and technical knowledge to set-up, but everything seems like a workaround and isn't easy.  Amazon wants you to purchase their Ring doorbell, another thermostat brand (EcoBee), and Amazon-branded cameras.  This is very frustrating, to say the least.  I beta test Google Products and it's the same thing there.  Their new Google Home Hub doesn't support Amazon products well, but that's a different review for a different platform  Again, these two behemoth awesome companies need to come to terms and support each other's ecosystems.  I know it's a competitive "thing" that is supposed to benefit the shareholder via an increased profit margin.  However, as the consumer, this is a sore huge spot for me and I assume others?<br/><br/>3) I've used the drop-in feature from the Amazon Application on my phone to this device.  It's slow; painfully slow to connect and subsequently come into focus.  Moreover, the camera on this device shoots up the ceiling so you can't really see the entire room you've "dropped-into" well.  In order to see someone, they have to be directly in front of the device. Perhaps these are meant to be security/privacy features or are these just half-baked implementations?<br/><br/>4) I like that you can now issue a follow-up command to Alexa.  That is, you can program the device to listen to your request without saying the wake word "Alexa" again.<br/><br/>5) The user interface seems rudimentary. - almost like a pre-schooler designed it.  Sure the screen is larger, but simply displaying the weather, a clock or sports scores on a cartoonish-like background isn't enough.  I'd really like to see my Google doorbell and cameras as a default dashboard here without purchasing the Google Home Hub.  My hopes are this changes with future software updates.  Amazon: you employ some of the smartest talent in the world so please upgrade this simplistic screen interface.  It looks silly and very much like a Palm Pilot interface on the early 2000s.<br/><br/>6) Why oh why does Amazon Prime only display the last 60 shows in your library here?  You need to use the phone/tablet/computer application to see your entire library.  Amazon Prime shows are another fantastic thing about an Amazon membership, so why limit the ability to see a users' inventory?  Also, the volume on Prime video is much softer than when playing Amazon Prime music.<br/><br/>7) If you care about someone seeing your personal pictures, you can restrict access to your Amazon picture library,  That is, you can disable the picture feature on the settings menu via a toggle switch, the picture library comes "ON" by default.  So....if you have any compromising/private pictures uploaded from your phone automatically to the Amazon Cloud, you may not want them to display on your Echo device.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this is an incremental improvement over the original product with the best feature being the larger screen size.  The speaker sound is OK, but not fantastic as a few other reviews note and the sound is lower when using Amazon Prime video.  I'd like to see a better and more modern user interface and better ability to integrate with Google products.
 When I first saw the Echo Show Gen 1, I was on the fence of getting it. Looked promising but the screen was a bit small for the price tag. Glad I waited for Gen 2! The screen on this thing is beautiful. Full HD and vibrant colors. I'm amazed that I can watch my Prime shows and it looks great. I also love the lyrics on the screen for Amazon Music. Sometimes I just want a solo karaoke session in my kitchen.<br/>The sound of the Echo Show was what impressed me the most. I'm upgrading from a 1st Gen Echo Dot and the moment I heard the sound of the Show, I was blown away! There is so much bass and the volume can get insanely loud for such a little device. The kitchen might be my second most favorite spot in the house. Touchscreen is also very responsive and works great. The only thing I wish it had was an app hub so I can choose exactly what I want. Sometimes Alexa doesn't understand what I want to watch. Best Amazon machine ever!! Can't wait to see what other devices they release.
 Someone at Amazon thought it would be a good idea to make the clock tiny and non-changeable.  That is the most important task this thing does is tell the time and you can't even see it.  You can't change the clock, the size of the type or any font on the home screen. I called Amazon Echo Support, they said a lot of people where complaining about the same things, they didn't have any solution and politely thanked me for my feedback....  Mine is going back it's useless to me, if I can't see the time.
 Can't disable the stupid home. It is non-stop displaying stupid snippets. Looking at it now it's telling me these:<br/><br/>Try "Alexa, play the Rhino video."<br/>Try "Alexa, tell me a horse joke"<br/>Try "Alexa, what's the top rated Bluethooth speaker?<br/>Try "Alexa, what can I make with spinach?"<br/>Try "Alexa, tell me something weird."<br/><br/>OMG, they don't stop!  All the damn day. No way to turn them off other than turning off the display.<br/><br/>Is it too much to ask to just have a clock? Make it an option. Duh!<br/><br/>I want to buy 30 of these for my office and use them as video intercoms. I have 3 I'm trying out and for this purpose (and music and all the other Alexa stuff), they work perfectly. But this stupid-lame "try" messaging that does not freaking stop, I will have to NOT but them because they are beyond annoying. So lame.<br/><br/>Why, Amazon, why?!?!
 The actual hardware has improved.  The sound quality on this Echo Show is definitely better than the first generation.  The screen is bolder as well.  I own a first generation Echo Show as well... I do not love the new software update that hit all Echo Shows.  For example, if I set my background to show my family photos from Amazon Photos, I do not want to see stock photos of news stories as well!  I know I can turn off updates in my settings... BUT I like the words from the updates, I just want them over my photos like the old Echo software!  As it stands now, a family picture will come up, then a news story photo.  This is quite annoying!<br/><br/>I do not know how long Amazon will rule this market.  The new Google Hub looks like a great device.  However, the inferior sound and lack of a camera still puts it behind the Echo Show.  But in a couple years if a Google Hub Max comes out... I may switch to that!  The Google brain just is outpacing what Amazon’s articfical intelligence can do. (I have both Echos, Echo Shows, and Google Home’s in my house!)  Facebook also just released an interesting device similar to the Echo Show that lets you video message FaceTime Messenger contacts.  But as of 2018-2019, in my opinion, this is the best device of its kind on the market!  I’m very happy with this Echo Show compared to the first generation Echo Show!!!
 Very disappointed with 2nd generation Show.  Most home screen options were removed.  Can’t customize clock anymore.  Constant “Try this” on bottom of screen is senseless.  Can’t display personal recipes.  You must use Allrecipes or Food network.  Not as responsive as Echo.  I have two Echos, one Dot.  Love them.  The Echo Show?  Not so much.  The constant updates that change the menus and choices on the entire Echo lineup is becoming tiresome.  It appears as if someone at Amazon is trying to justify their jobs.
 I wanted one of these devices for the longest time...I don't know why!!!! To say I'm disappointed with this purchase is an understatement!  I really want to return this device and the tower echo and buy the Google Portal.  This thing is so limited its unreal.  I didn't know I couldn't access the internet to watch videos...this was not published well. I can't make video calls very easy either, it's always voice calls - even to those with the echo show.  I tried to get Alexa to tell me how to re-heat corn on the cob and she kept giving me recipes for corn on the cob.  Even when I speak slowly and articulate carefully, I still have issues.  I need to check the return policy...as I sit here writing, I'm more upset. UGH. Save your money and time - don't buy this device or the other echo.

Took away one star - wish I didn't always have to repeat some commands. Needs to improve understanding commands.<br/>For those people who mentioned the clock/weather is TOO SMALL, please look at the last photo. You can magnify the clock/information  by going to Settings &gt; Accessibility
 Very disappointed at this product. I was very excited to utilize this at home, but I come to find out after trying to use it for something else other than music that Alexa doesn't seem to find anything online, its unable to show videos or music videos and its a hassle to link with other devices, when asked to do a task it takes three or for times for her to actually understand what you're saying or it gives you random information for an answer
 I really like the larger 10.1 inch screen. But 720p really? The speakers are a lot better than than the 1st generation. And they get better the more you pump sound through them. And one big disappointment is that SiriusXM stations still do not show the artist, song or album. My Grace Digital can do that. At any rate I am happy so far. Also you can pair the Alexa remote to it. You just have to do it through on screen settings not the Alexa app tada....
 I was super excited about receiving the 2nd Gen Echo Show today. But, after spending a few hours with it, I’m not that impressed. I’ll start off by saying the sound quality and output is amazing, other than that, I’m struggling to find a good use for it. I’ll give a full rundown below:<br/><br/>Backstory:<br/><br/>This is my first “screened” echo product. Originally, I was thinking this would have similar features to an android tablet. I wanted to use it in the kitchen and run some of my cooking/recipe “apps” on it. I somehow missed the memo that the Show is essentially an echo dot with a screen, and you can only choose from the limited “Amazon Skills” selection from the Alexa app using voice control. *In full disclosure and “TMI”, I’m on a strict low-carb/ sugar-free diet - the native recipe skill is almost useless for me...*<br/><br/>I know, I know, you can watch prime and other videos on it, but I have no idea why you would want to watch something on a 10” tabletop screen when your TV is 10x bigger, or on a tablet that's 50x thinner...<br/><br/>There is almost zero personalization available and everything seems to be locked down. Heck, I can’t even select items or information (like 5-day weather, news, calendar) to display on the home screen. Unless I’m missing something here, looks like the whole operating system literally just runs off the voice-controlled “skills”.<br/><br/>Out of curiosity, I went ahead and ordered the Fire HD 10” tablet with “Show Dock”, and I'm glad I did... With the Fire Tablet, I'm able to run the apps I like and it's completely mobile. I don't have the sound quality that the Show had, but this can easily be fixed with a nice Bluetooth speaker.
 I just unwrapped the device and the entire screen wasn’t screwed in! You can clearly see all 6 screws missing!! So I called support and have been trying to get a USA based rep and all they keep saying is the earliest they can replace the item is December 28th!!! Well I’m supposed to fly to another state later this week to give to an elderly relative! And this would be a disaster if it was a Christmas present!! Well I’ve been on hold for almost 15 mins waiting for a rep I can understand.. my advise is DO NOT BUY!! They rushed the manufacturing and the support is horrendous!!<br/><br/>Update - This is still an ongoing NIGHTMARE!!! I finally got through to support after multiple calls and was promised a new device was being sent straight to FL where I was flying to do the install for elderly grandma with Alzheimers. I traveled yesterday to FL from NJ to install and the device they sent was an Echo Show 1 that was REFURBISHED and missing the charger!!! I sent an email last night and got a reply that they will be happy to replace my defective eco show 1 with a refurbished unit as per the warranty... I am now waiting on hold again for a supervisor to attempt to make this right... (will continue to update)
 We are a family of 7, and currently have 5 other Alexa devices in various rooms around the house. Our household uses the devices on a daily basis. I was pretty excited about the possibility of the Echo show. We could use it in the kitchen for the family calendar! Or for recipes! Or maybe to watch a show! Oh the possibilities!<br/><br/>We bought their 2 for $120 off deal black Friday 2018. I was intending on giving one of the units to the in-laws for Christmas and putting the other in our kitchen. The in-laws were wanting something that showed a nice big clock with the date and day of the week (among other things). I figured that the show would definitely be able to do that! Turns out I was sorely mistaken. The clock is a small little thing in the top corner that is not customizable at all. No date, no day of the week.<br/><br/>But hey, at least it has a calendar right?.. that is essentially useless. It only shows one or two days, or not even a day if you have multiple things on the calendar. It doesn't even highlight what the current day it is! There is no monthly or weekly view, just a extremely zoomed in view of 1 or two appointments. There is no option to customize anything. You get what you get. Why would you have a calendar without a week/month view?<br/><br/>We also were thinking it would be great for recipes. Turns out that because I'm in Canada, close to none of the 'standard' skills even work. Amazon has geolocked the recipes skill!?!? Ok, so no problem we can't use the recipes skill that is advertised clearly on the side of the box. I'll get over that and use the browser to show a recipe. So, I opened up the browser to a recipe site and started cooking dinner. After a couple minutes, the device times out and returns to the home screen! "Alexa, reopen my browser" should get me back to the page I was on right? No! It takes me back to the home page and I have to navigate to the recipe again. Rinse and repeat every two minutes until I give up and open up a physical cookbook.<br/><br/>EVERYTHING that I wanted to do with this device doesn't work. No clock, no calendar, no recipies, no netflix, no &lt;insert whatever you think it will do here&gt;. I'm sure that all these things will all get addressed in time,but right now it really falls short.<br/><br/>I gave this 3 stars because the actual physical product is excellent. Quality is great, speakers sound really good, screen is bright. I have no complaints about anything physical on the device. It really is a very nice physical product, but the firmware is close to completely useless for anything that I want to do with it. I will most likely return the units I bought. Maybe I'll buy them again once they have addressed some of the things that would actually make this useful.
 20181108: I bought two new Echo Shows several days ago, one at home, one for the office.<br/><br/>The good stuff:<br/><br/>1. Easy to set up. I had the Show up and functional in under 15 minutes. It was already registered to me, all I had to do was rename it (based on the room I placed it in). Downloading the Alexa iPhone app made setup even easier. Within about 30 minutes I had most of the home smart devices connected, included Nest devices and the SmartThings hub.<br/><br/>2. Good sound. I don't think it will compete with a Sonos or the new Apple Homepod, but the sound is good, and for most applications, more than good enough.<br/><br/>3. Very nice to have the calendar and other life-organizing items pulled in from Google and other sources to show on the screen.<br/><br/>4. Does a nice job showing recipes.<br/><br/>5. It will read your kindle books to you.<br/><br/>The bad stuff:<br/><br/>1. Alexa doesn't handle names very well. And, if you have names in SmartThings that weren't fully thought out, you may run into a few problems. To clean up the labels for a voice-activated environment, I had to carefully rename a number of items and groups, ensuring that no words overlapped. That can be a challenge with multiple Hue lamps and other smart devices in the same room. Naming the lamps kitchen 1, kitchen 2, and kitchen 3 works great, until you also want a group called Kitchen Lights.... Same for the porch lights, and so on. In the end, I've renamed almost every device with some name that is not directly overlapping with the group I want it in (usually a group will be a room).<br/><br/>2. The device sits with the screen, and the camera, at an angle. This is OK if you are reading a list, but not so great if you want to use DropIn either as an intercom, or to check on your home while you are away. As I mentioned in my Echo Spot review, mostly you get a great view of the ceiling. For the hefty price take (about $220) the device should allow adjustment of the camera angle.<br/><br/>3. The unit is made to sit on a surface, a shelf or a counter. It would be great to be able to wall mount it, but that won't happen without some special hardware.<br/><br/>One other item to discuss: all Alexa devices require a login. You can login with the same account on all of them, which solves some problems, but causes others. I have a wife and two kids. Alexa assumes everyone is me, because I logged in with my Amazon account on all the devices. So? It means the reminders are mine, the alarms are mine, the calendars are mine... all my stuff on every device.<br/><br/>Amazon, if you really want to make Alexa useful, you need to make Alexa family-aware. If my son updates the calendar on the Spot in his room, it should stay with him, and he doesn't need to know about my appointments. The Echo Show in the kitchen is a community device for the entire house, but the Spot or Dot on the nightstand should be much more personal, especially for alarms and calendars. And Drop In should work for all the devices, no matter who the device is personalized for.
 Thought this would be a great idea for my 100 year old grandmother. Turns out she has to also have a cellphone number. Ok... that isn't happening, thanks for highlighting that as a requirement for this unit to function =\
 First, this is an order of magnitude improvement in terms of hardware. Much larger screen, which looks great. Very bright, good color, all as expected. It looks nicer as well. This device is larger and heavier. The sound is much improved in terms of the speakers, drivers, etc. and it has bass response the 1st gen Echo could not dream of. All in all, much as presented here on Amazon.<br/><br/>As expected, there are some software issues and omissions. It's a new release, after all. So I'm sure Amazon will be fixing these soon.  Many have noticed the LOUD Alexa voice response. It is truly annoying. Hopefully, they will fix this soon. Ideally they would let you set Alexa's voice response level independently from media. As it is, media volume is much lower.<br/><br/>Also, they appear to have used spatial processing to give you a stereo effect and it works great. But it's not always desirable. There should be an option to disable it. For example, it works great for some music, but not well at all for other music.  Also, the bass response is overdone - for some things - even when I lower the bass in the equalizer to minimum levels. The equalizer adjustments need more range or tweaking, in my opinion.  At first I thought, wow, I won't need my external speakers now, This thing sounds great. But as I went on, I soon learned that wasn't the case and reverted back to using my Bluetooth speaker. The spatial effect interference with mid-range (vocals) is the primary reason as it alters the balance of sounds, but the over-done boomy bass is also an issue. It's less of an issue at lower volumes.<br/><br/>Some music sounds great. And movies I watched from Prime Video all sounded very good. With movies the bass and spatial sound works very well and everything sounded fantastic. It made for a very enjoyable movie experience.<br/><br/>I was a beta user for the original Echo and we went through some of this with that device as well and Amazon did a great job of addressing the issues, so I am sure they will do the same this time around. The hardware is a huge step up in performance, so the results should be excellent.<br/><br/>So vastly improved screen and sound drivers, they just need to get the software tweaked for music. Also, as some have noted, not all of the functionality is working properly at this point. Most all of the basic stuff does. Some  things still have glitches. But give them time.<br/><br/>I will try to come back and update as things unfold. Giving 4 stars for now as I like it even with the glitches.<br/><br/>Update:After lowering the bass (a lot) and moving the Echo to another location, sound has improved.  Still would like finer controls, but it definitely has great sound potential. Some songs sound incredibly good. The spatial effect can be very enjoyable with the right source material.  Also, as mentioned, it works extremely well with most movies.
 Replacement update: still 1 star<br/>Made sure to keep volume at a max of 50 and turned bass below 50. How other people aren't getting a VERY noticeable rattle on  mid bass is beoyomd me.<br/><br/>30 minute update: 2 stars to 1. A speaker just blew while playing at 50% volume. Absolutely  ridiculous.<br/><br/>Just received the new show, and not impressed. We have all of the other Echo products and this one is probably the biggest let down. The screen gets it the two stars, but the sound/speakers are a HIGE miss. Without front speakers it is just odd and very obvious the sound is being blocked by the screen. Sorry, but the old show had it right with the front facing speakers. I'll give it a couple of days, but this one is probably going back with the price it commands.
 The Echo Show 2nd gen is amazing.<br/><br/>The screen is not only bigger but your wallpapers look more vivid especially pics with Autumn Leaves<br/><br/>Echo Show 2 is louder then Echo Show 1<br/><br/>You can access your smarthome controls in settings eg lights,switches,plugs etc.<br/><br/>You can ask Alexa to pull up firefox and silk browsers and you can view YouTube. I was able to view all my YouTube favorites,history,subscriptions etc once I logged in.<br/><br/>Music sounds more crisp on the Echo Show 2 especially Dolby<br/><br/>Show 2 has a lot of base but you can cut that down in the alexa app or in the settings as well I think.<br/><br/>I recommend the Echo Show Gen 2 and the Stand Accessory sold seperatly thru amazon.  The stand makes it look even better as you'll see in my picture.<br/><br/>An FYI Echo Show Gen 1 also now has the browsers,light controls,youtube etc since an Update. The advantage of the Echo Show 2 over the 1 is mainly the bigger screen size and it's HD Screen.<br/><br/>The Echo Show 1 is just a little brighter then the Echo Show 2 but the Show 2 looks better with your wallpaper pictures cause of the HD Screen. Show 1 isn't an HD Display.
 First, the highlights:<br/>1. The new screen is a significant improvement.<br/>2. The already excellent voice recognition range appears to be improved due to front facing microphones.  More experience is required here.<br/>3. Better low end extension to the audio.<br/>And the lowlights:<br/>1. The fabric is nice right now but will degrade and makes it difficult to clean the device.<br/>2. The display is edge lit and the backlight is very visible and annoying.<br/>3. Alexa (and all content) sounds like she's living in a box because the speakers aren't front facing.<br/><br/>It looks like they tried to upgrade everything but in the design room the form team won out over the function team.<br/><br/>Tip: It sounds great if you turn it around and have the rear of the device face you.
 This is really a glorified intercom. Bought a mix of echo dots and shows for the house this year for Christmas. Upon getting to know the system, i realized that you can only stream music on two devices at once. So I looked into it and you can create a household that lets 2 adults, 2 teens and 2 kids to stream music but this again will cost you 150 dollars a year to make that work. Also, i decided to move all of my photos and music to amazon so that it was all in one place. After a 40 minute phone call with customer service, i learned that you are now unable to upload any music bought on any other platform to amazon music. So I have amazon music unlimited but they are still asking me to pay for music that i have previously purchased. This is very upsetting. Also, supposedly you get unlimited photos being a prime member but as i was uploading my photos......all of a sudden i was told that i was out of space and had to pay more to store and backup my photos. My advice buy a google home or an apple product depending on where you store your music and videos.
 This is nicely designed hardware. Pulling it out of the box, you get a sense that you're buying something of good quality. It has good, loud speakers, and a reasonably nice screen. I was pretty excited.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the user interface let me down. I can feel the huge potential for this product, but every time I tried to do something, I was stymied in some way. It's not like it's a bad interface, it's more like it's not finished. For example, the home screen seems like it would be a great way to check on my day. I'd like to see a forecast for the today and maybe the next couple of days on the main screen. The other half of the screen could show maybe sports scores or news headlines, or maybe the status of all the connected lights in the house, or maybe a touch screen of quick actions to jump to recently used stuff.<br/><br/>None of that is available. You can get a rotating view of news headlines, but you can't pick your source. You can see sports information, but for some reason it only shows my local football team, and there's no way to choose. This would be a perfect heads up display, but the rotation of elements means that you'll have to stare at the screen for a long time before what you need pops up. Again, lots of potential, but not there yet.<br/><br/>Another thing to do with this is watch videos in the kitchen when you're cooking. This works okay, but everything about choosing and finding episodes in clunky and unfinished. For example, I wanted to watch the next show in the series I was watching, but for some reason, it went to the first episode. I could not see any way to go to the episodes list so I could choose the next episode, and I didn't know the correct number, so I couldn't try asking Alexa.<br/><br/>I thought about keeping it because if Amazon keeps iterating on the UI, someday it could be quite useful. However, at this point, it's well-designed hardware with software that frustratingly just wouldn't do what I wanted. I also considered keeping it because it works with the Fire TV Recast, but in the end, the hard to use interface was just a little too much to overcome, at least for now.
 Please add clock face and weather display that is readable from across the room.
 I find this device to be disappointing for the price.  I’ve had the Show for a few days.  It has a few positives (nice display, decent sound, Zigbee controller) and others have commented on them.  I don’t use Zigbee devices, so that’s not a benefit to me.  However, what I noticed most are the negatives:<br/><br/>1. It can’t do 2 things at one time.  For instance, it’s not possible to watch the livestream of your baby sleeping and also play music or an audiobook.  It can do one or the other.  A Fire tablet can do both, though without the audio power of the Show.<br/>2. It’s not possible to watch the map tracking of your delivery.  Perhaps it would require computer components to do that, but I find it annoying that it’s not possible on the Show.  It’s available on my Fire tablets or Shop Amazon app, and it would be nice to watch on the Show.<br/>3. It has no light ring for notifications.  I’m surprised at how irritating I find this.  I can walk through a room that has an Echo or Dot in it and immediately see that there is something I should attend to.  Not so with the Show.  Only if I happen to be in the room at the time a message arrives will I be aware there is a message.<br/>4. It doesn’t show the list of your skills.  Alexa will read them off instead.  This is way too slow.<br/>5. It nicely plays Prime videos.  However, it’s like watching a 10 inch TV when I’ve got a huge big screen and Fire TV on the opposite wall.<br/><br/>I love my Fire tablets, Echos, Dots, and Fire TVs.  I’m also liking my new Amazon Smart Plugs.  I also felt those devices were good values when on sale.  The Echo Show has me less enthused.
 I embraced voice-controlled applications and services on Amazon Echo devices over a year ago and was thrilled to finally get a chance to try out the new Echo Show. I had been wanting a display device for use in the kitchen where I could refer to recipes while I am preparing a new dish and was also interested in purchasing an Alexa-enabled video doorbell so I could check to see who was at the door whenever I hear the dogs start barking while I am working on my computer in my home office.  I don't yet have the video doorbell but I did ask the new Show to display recipes for corn beef and cabbage, one of my husband's favorite dishes, and the images were sharp and the colors brilliant.  I also enabled an ambient sound skill and enjoyed both hearing the mountain river and seeing a relaxing HD video of the stream.  As a photographer, I hope to develop my own skills for the Show that will be both inspiring and educational!
 This might seem like a small thing, but it’s enough to make me want to return it. It is IMPOSSIBLE to turn off the nerdy and annoying suggestions. If I want to try something I freaking will. They run all day all the time. So lame.
 The good: The sound quality is excellent compared to the Echo. The screen quality and video clarity are also good.<br/>The bad: It takes far too long to update. For example, when you put your calendar events on your home screen, it is usually 12-24 hours behind, showing you yesterday's events. Same goes for notifications. Received an Amazon shipment and my Echo notified at 10:16am, it wasn't till 10:56am that my Echo Show gave me that info.<br/>The ugly: Home screen just isn't actually prepared to display properly. If connected to your calendar, it will only show one even for the day, rather than scrolling through multiple events, requiring you to touch the screen to go into your calendar (at that point I could just be using my regular Echo device). Headlines/stories are completely random, and cut off mid sentence. So you'll see something like "Snakes loose in the wester" and again would have to touch the screen to dig in further. It also seems to have a much harder time hearing me that my regular Echo devices, especially if it's playing music! Additionally, it simply isn't designed to be seen from across the room; I have a small city apartment so at most I'm 10 feet away, the time and weather are tiny little dots in the corner of a an otherwise empty screen, and there's no way you'll be able to read the "try" scroll on the bottom of the screen unless you're right on top of it.<br/><br/>Unless you are using this for the specific purpose of video chatting with someone else who has an Echo Show, I'd say save your money till they make the adjustments. With Google Home Hub (which unlike the Echo Show has the ability to search and play YouTube videos) only costing $150, and regular Echo devices at $100, this just feels like a missed opportunity that is over priced, not prepared for a good user experience, and overall not worth the cost!
 I've tried to update my review, they seem to not let it through. Video problem still on my device. Total of 8 devices in our family still having issue. Returning them does not fix it. I have done YouTube videos explaining the problem.<br/><br/>5 units in our family that do this. We have sent pictures and they still have not figured it out. My 3rd is on it's way I'll keep this review updated.<br/>I have received my 2nd echo show 2nd generation due to faulty video on first one, after being in a call for an hour or so the screen turns black-and-white with lines through it you have to turn video off and back on to get it to be color again I returned the 1st one got the 2nd 1 and tonight the 2nd 1 did the same thing I am contacting them again I have no idea what to do. My daughters did same thing, we are both on our second unit.<br/>Update..........been a week or so. Still getting black and white with lines periodically on my video to the caller while in a call. My daughter is on her 3rd Echo Show and hers is also still doing it.<br/>I'm calling this week again to see if they can figure this out.
 Edit Nov 2, 2018.<br/>I've been working with Amazon support on my issues around how the device handles light level detection and how it behaves overnight when used as a bedside device.  My main issues were 1) the device did not sleep as expected (so it was distracting while sleeping) and 2) the ambient light sensing mode did not work properly (it made the device VERY dark).  I have some updates and feedback on Amazon's support process and where we stand.<br/><br/>First, Amazon support has been excellent.  They reached out to me directly to discuss the issues and have solicited my feedback and "evidence" (videos for example) to demonstrate the behavior.  They've had their engineering team involved... so it's obvious they are taking this seriously and want to fix the issues assuming they are valid and can be validated.  This is what I'd expect.  I'm very happy so far.<br/><br/>Related to sleep mode.  At night, by default, I've determined that if the "Adaptive Brightness" is turned on then the device will not sleep properly and will continue to cycle through the various screens prompting you for interactions.  The normal stuff.  If you turn "Adaptive Brightness" OFF then it does work.  This is counter intuitive but the good news is that this mode works and resolves the issue of the device working as a bedside device, I'm happy to say.<br/><br/>In relation to when the Adaptive Brightness mode is ON and the device becoming too dark I am still working on validating that with support.  They're serious about fixing the issue so I'm hopeful.<br/><br/>I've raised my review rating based on the above and my genuine positive experience with the Gen2 Show outside of those issues.  The audio is superb, the screen is great, and it's a great platform.  I am completely willing to recommend the device now assuming folks understand the dimming issues mentioned above and how to address them.  To summarize, currently:<br/>1. For Bedside use disable "Adaptive Brightness" in the display settings.  This allows the device to go into sleep mode at night when next to you on a bedside table.<br/>2.  When not used as a bedside device it's ok to use Adaptive Brightness but be aware that you may need to turn the brightness level up so that it doesn't go too dark.  IF you turn AB on and the screen goes to dark just raise the brightness level as I noted.<br/><br/>Original review:<br/>So, I have 3 V1s and now 2 V2 Shows.  I like the devices, obviously, or I wouldn't have invested in them for use around the house.  The 10" V2 is a great upgrade in most ways.  Bigger screen, much better sound, some new interface features (but Echo still needs a LOT of work in this area) but it also has a nearly game breaking flaw.<br/><br/>On all of my V1s the screen dimming worked awesome.  If it was night time and there was no activity in a room the screen would dim, intelligently, and the display would just show the clock.  The idea here obviously was to reduce distractions during sleep.  This made the Show a great device for the bedside.  Not any more (at least for now).<br/><br/>V2 of the show has a serious problem with dimming and "sleep" detection, as I would call it.  There are two problems compared to the previous model:<br/>1.  The device does not properly detect light levels, or react to them, so that if the Ambient Light sensor is "enabled" it will dim to an almost unreadable state if the ambient light source is behind the unit.  Sometimes even if it's not.  I had to turn this feature off completely as I could not see the display on my devices about half the time!<br/>2.  The biggest flaw is that the device NO LONGER detects that a room has no activity if used at bedside (and possibly elsewhere).  I spent a very restless night because the screen on my Show V2 would NOT go to "sleep" mode (where it completely dims and only the clock is shown) and it was SUPER annoying.  I have no idea how to fix this.  I cannot use the Ambient Light sensor because then I would not be able to see the device during the day much of the time.  I'm puzzled.<br/><br/>Note that I've confirmed that the V2 is using the same settings as the V1 so this should not be happening.  In general... it's a big problem and if it's not resolved I may be returning the device here before too long.  The bigger display and improved sound are not worth losing sleep at night.
 The screen is bigger and the sound is better, but that's it , so its definitely not worth spending the much higher price for it.  It also stopped working after a week , so I returned it.
 I wanted to upgrade my current echo to a video device. My daughter already purchase the Echo Show and it looked good to me. I arrived within a few days. The main reason I wanted the device was to talk to my daughter and grandkids via the video messaging service. Then I found out it required a smart phone to make that happen. I do not own a smart phone. I use an iPad to manage the older Echo. I was not going to purchase a new phone just to make this device work. So I sent it back to Amazon. I still have not found where the Echo Show calls out the requirement for the smart phone with it sales promotion.
 Nothing special. Mostly a source of frustration because it always says " hum I don't know that." Don't expect the video portion to work well for anything. Basically it's just good for music and the shopping list. Way over priced! Oh, over whelming amount of advertising included with your purchase. If you like junk mail this is for you.
 I have had the first gen Echo since it came out.  The sound was decent and I had it hooked up to my Smartthings hub for full home automation.  However, I found myself migrating more and more over to the Google ecosystem and the Home hub devices.  When the 2nd Gen show came out, I decided to give it a try.  I was convinced that I was going to return it the next day.  Brought it home, set it up, did some research and found more about Hulu Live and it's integration with Alexa.  Connected my Ring doorbell and cameras ... the next day, I did go back to Best Buy - but I bought one more of the 2nd Gen Show's and two more of the Spot devices for my boys rooms.  I have disconnected all my Google devices and will be adding the 4k Fire Stick when it's released next week.  Absolutely love the 2nd Show and Spot devices.  The camera doesn't bother me at all because I have a $0.30 piece of plastic that is a lens cover like on my laptop - and when I am not using the camera, I slide that over the lens and no one can secretly watch us.  Love the drop in feature because I now placed one of these in my mom's house is up in age.  I will be disconnecting my cable subscription and using Hulu Live because I get all the local stations in addition to the cable channels that I use.  That will save me over $70 per month .. and I can watch on all my Fire Stick devices, Show's, etc.  Lastly, I did buy the Google Home Hub as well with the 7" monitor ... that was the one I was convinced I would be using.  However, the sound is awful compared to the Show, it's tiny and if you want to watch any sort of videos on the screen - it sucks because it's so small ... I returned the Google Home Hub the same day it came in ... Hope this helps.
 I am very pleased with the new look and sound. The quality of the upgraded speaker and screen gives you that small TV look and sound in the Kitchen.  I'm looking forward to great experiences.
 So far we love the echo shows. My mom had a stroke a couple of years ago that left her unable to speak, therefore can not answer or talk on the phone. We got one to put in my mom's nursing home room so we can drop in on her without her having to speak to answer and the kids can tell her about their day or just say hello when we can't get over to visit. The speaker is phenomenal!  I get better sound from the echo than I do from my stereo.
 I bought this to be a hub in my kitchen for watching videos and viewing recipes while cooking, with the potential for adding a front-door camera down the line.<br/><br/>So far, when I have tried to use it, it has been a letdown. The Alexa commands are not exhaustive/intuitive enough to navigate purely by voice, but there is also no effective way to navigate by touch. Asking Alexa to play a program that is available on Hulu sent me to Prime Video instead, where it showed a pay option. When I tried to display a recipe, it continued to time out between when I glanced at the screen, completed a step, and returned to see what was next. With egg- or floured-covered hands, it was an extremely frustrating process that led me to print the recipe anyway.<br/><br/>Beyond those experiences, my Echo Show has sat dormant, which is very unusual for a new toy. It does not seem to be worth the money, and I might be returning mine and returning to the radio and my cookbooks, which accomplish as much or more as this new piece of technology.
 I had very high expectations of this device but it has one flaw I don't think I can get over.  There is a constantly changing, annoying, intrusive "Try" notification at the bottom of the home screen that cannot be stopped. I tried the turn off notifications in the Alexa app, no change, I set it to not rotate the home screen, turned off all home screen notifications and it still persisted. I contacted customer service via chat and was told there was not a way or option to turn off the "Try" notifications, they are there to alert you to what all Alexa can do.  I did not realize I was also purchasing a 24 hour a day Alexa ad.  It will  likely be going back and I'll be trying Google home or FB Portal.  I love Amazon and Alexa, I just don't want her pestering me continuously in bright white, 3/4 inch font on my home screen.
 Once you get past which ecosystem to commit to, make no mistake, this Smart Display is really slick.....setting aside the fact that IMHO Alexa is better in a number of ways over the Google Assistant for these purposes, and considering I own both the Google Home Hub and the Show Gen 2, I have to say that the display size of the Show Gen 2 is a huge win/+.  Saying 'Alexa' is also easier and more reliable than 'OK Google' or 'Hey Google'.<br/><br/>As for screen quality on this unit, very nice.  And the audio quality is very good.  I love the fact that you can get some thumping bass from this product too.  It's audio quality is sufficient to fill an entire room.  All the features that Amazon advertises for this product work pretty well, to really well.  It's not often that this happens.....<br/><br/>The home automation aspects of this Smart Display are very good, to great.  It relies heavily on having the Alexa App on your smartphone, but I don't see this as a big drawback.  And the Mic array is particularly adept at hearing you correctly the first time....<br/><br/>I'm not going to do a deep dive on all the features....as Amazon's content on the site does a good job of this.  For the asking price, I think it's one of the best Smart Displays released so far this year.  And because I'm Prime, I get tons of content right off the bat, i.e. music, movies, apps, shopping, order updates 'Alexa', where's my stuff, etc.<br/><br/>Google Home Hub sits in the bedroom.....Echo Show Gen 2 sits in the kitchen, where we spend 70% of our time.  Provided Amazon continues to push updates to this unit for some time to come, I think this experience will only get better and better!  Can't wait.
 Sound died about 20 minutes in to use. Connected to Internet — check. Restarted - check. Factory reset - check. Maybe it was connected to a bluetooth speaker and I couldn’t hear. Nope - check. It’s a first world problem but we work hard for our money and  at a minimum expect that a product we buy works. PS - I’m standing here with my 14 yr son trying to figure this out and explain how sometimes things just get made cheap and “you get what you pay for” and realize that I sound like my dad.  Please don’t make me sound like my dad. (Quick update: by some miracle, it worked this morning)
 I had a few issues with some of the ones I bought the first day they were available... but I got new ones and these are perfect. I am so in love with these things it's ridiculous.<br/><br/>The only things I wish:<br/> -The "Calendar" card on the home screen would show me ALL of my events at a glance without me having to ask for my calendar.<br/>-Native support for Dark Sky as my weather source (with severe weather alerts) - the 3rd party app Big sky is an ok stop gap for now, but not good enough.<br/><br/> -Added bonus would be Google tasks/reminders integration but that seems unlikely.
 Bought two of these I  was going to give one to my wife and one to her 90 year old mom so they could video talk. I am thinking of  returning them as you can't hook up two, to one cell phone. This is not good! 'I'm trying an end around by using someone else phone  in the family but it's very inconvenient. WHY CAN"T WE JUST USE THE APP TO ADD CONTACTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  NOT happy so much time and aggravation. I will say this we like what it does as far as the things it does.  BUT I purchased them for one main reason and if we can't use it for that it's going back I don't need a 250.$ alarm clock.
 Updates:  I have updated this and I gave it another star.<br/>There is an Amazon-produced youtube video that is worth watching.  However<br/>it isn't in the Amazon help, and it isn't referenced by any of the Amazon help.<br/>It gives some of the basics of the device.  I found it on google.<br/>You can find it by searching for "Echo Show Basics" and it is about 3.5 minutes long.<br/>If you watch the video, the device will be less infuriating and can easily be made<br/>less presumptive.<br/><br/>In the book "1984" there was a telescreen.  It was always listening.  Always watching.<br/>I always wondered how these devices might come into existence and into peoples homes.<br/>I think that I just bought one.  Maybe I'm just afraid that I just bought one.<br/><br/>BTW, I do have an Echo, and I like it.<br/>The Show, however, is another story.<br/><br/>The default mode is for it to be constantly doing something on the screen,<br/>switching between "cards" which present separate types of information.<br/>I spent most of today searching for or figuring out how to turn things off.<br/><br/>The home card/screen starts out with lots of stuff turned on. (That is the presumptive part.)<br/>Trending topics, sports scores, upcoming events, Discovery with Alexa are all on, but you<br/>can turn them off.<br/>The one thing you cannot turn off is the Try "Alexa, ..." hint at the bottom of the screen<br/>I searched for hours on how to turn this off.  It even displays when you are listening to music.<br/>(This is what "infuriating" is referring to in the title!)<br/><br/>The default mode when playing songs is to show the lyrics.  There doesn't seem to be<br/>a setting in the any of the various settings options to change this.  However, if you tap<br/>the progress bar for a song while it is playing, it will bring up controls.  There is a "Lyrics"<br/>button.  I'm sure I just dense, but it took me a while to find this.<br/><br/>I also feel much more paranoid about the camera than I thought I would, even with it disabled.<br/>I am not very happy with the device and wish that I never bought it.  Hopefully, it will improve over time.<br/>I understand that some competitive devices have a shutter.<br/><br/>Some things I do like:<br/>The multiple timer screen is pretty nice.  But, if you set a timer on one device, the other device doesn't know about it.<br/>Sound is pretty good.  Another reviewer mentioned that the movie volume is noticeably less than the music or Alexa volume.  I also found this to be true.<br/>The display is good.<br/><br/>Some things it doesn't suggest, but should:<br/>"Alexa, go home"<br/>"Alexa, go to settings"<br/>"Alexa, turn off screen"<br/>"Alexa, stop streaming"  This will cause it to release the stream so that another device can stream something.
 I’ve really liked the 1st generation Echo Show and so when I say the features of the 2nd generation I quickly preordered it. I replaced all 4 of my 1st generation Echo Shows with 2nd generation Echo Shows and repurposed the older ones.<br/><br/>The screen is a big improvement on the 2nd Gen, you can really notice the size difference and the new screen looks a lot clearer. We use this for streaming cameras too and as a baby monitor and night and you can see all the detail you need to see.<br/><br/>The sound is improved as well. I listen to Pandora pretty much all day long on the Show in my office and for the size and footprint of it the sound quality is great. I will say the one thing I noticed, as far as audio goes, when you ask Alexa to turn up/down the volume vs. using the button the voice command jumps what seems to be a couple steps and I find myself having to go over and turn it down manually if it has gotten too loud. I get around this gernally by saying a specific level i.e. “Alexa, set the volume to 4”.<br/><br/>Overall I’m very happy I upgraded to the 2nd generation Echo Shows!
 Simple Review:<br/>Screen being 10inches is great when I’m watching Hulu and YouTube.<br/>I bought 2 and saved $100, 1 for the kitchen and 1 for my bedroom. I was driven to buy this when I heard it at an Amazon Store. Sound quality alone was enough to buy. Video chatting is easy and simple to apple or android devices. Philips hue smart bulb connected easily with “Alexa, discover devices”. The consistent carousel of content, reminders, upcoming events and news keeps me checking the screen throughout the day. It’s also simple to see my security cameras without interrupting the TV like I use to when I used the Fire TV. I’m waiting for a update for Netflix and screen mirroring. It’s a Great buy. PLEASE GET MAPS AND TRAVEL UPDATED.
 OK COOL<br/>so, I’m not a huge fan of lets s do a review, but I wanted to share for others who are still trying to decide weather or not to sir d the money... WORTH IT!!!<br/>Ok I’m like the smart home everything person. From Hue lights &amp; plugs, to echo dots, microwave and prime tv etc etc<br/>Now I have the echo show MERRY XMAS TO ME 😎<br/>It was soooo soooo easy to install and it automatically picked up all my smart home devices and my WIFI<br/>It immediately ran updates and works amazingly well.<br/>So far it has not caused the TV to pause like the cube did. A small glitch I’m sure Amazon will remedy someday. I gave my cube as a gift. Cube is killer if that’s your only echo device. So, back to the show!! The sound is great &amp; it’s BIGGER than I expected which is a BONUS!!! The graphics are great and you need to speak clearly while your show is getting to know you... so far so good with the new SHOW... as I use it we will see how it performs. I bought a second for my father for Xmas so we have to wait to test the calling feature for show to show. But for show to cell phone it works great🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼<br/>Still you have all the features of the echo dot but better!!! You can watch tv, see online content re: recipes WAHOOOOO all you foodies<br/>So, if your contemplating this I definitely would say DO IT!!!!<br/>Hopefully they’ll come down on price in the future however, best deal is right now, Black Friday deal... 120.00 off when You buy 2 echo shows!! Happy turkey day Amazon..
 Product looks awesome and great. But limited to things you can do. I was trying to replace it with my iPad but no apps to download. Nothing you can add too. This could be awesomeness but NOPE
 After trying this device for a few months I've decided that it is the most useless device offered by amazon.  The alexa/echo commands rarely work, tHe screen resolution is 1970's in appearance....I could go on but now I see that amazon has lowered the price substanially and I know why....
 The commercial where the daughter burns the dinner before her date arrives and her dad helps her out via video on the Echo Show literally makes me tear up every time.  My dad is not able to help me with things like that.  He has dementia and has trouble walking.  I am his daughter, but live six hours away from his nursing home.  We used to talk on the phone all the time, but now he has trouble answering his cell phone and indeed yesterday left it in his pants, washed it and the cell phone died.  I could not talk to him as I wanted. He was not able to answer video calls via Alexa without me reminding him on his cell to push the answer button.  But now, Thanks to the Drop-In feature I can just video call him anytime without him having to answer and the nurses have left a note telling him what to say so he can drop in on me and his two beautiful granddaughters when he wants.  Now, we spend hours together.  It is nothing short of a miracle to see his and my face and his granddaughters faces light up as he is able to interact with my family EVERY  SINGLE  DAY. You have brought our lives JOY and i cannot thank you enough for this innovative technology and the ease with which to operate it.<br/>My kids and family adore every single feature and we are getting to know more and more about what it can do.<br/>Thank you sincerely from the bottom of our hearts.
 Got a brick.  Now I am waiting 2 days for a new one.  If you get one and it is like this....don't go through support.  Just return and replace.
 It is nice product for what we wanted to use it for.  It works like a kitchen TV at our house with our Hulu subscription.  Only complaint is that the volume level is different by application.  For example,  Hulu sound may be just fine.  Ask it to play music and it is really loud even though you have not adjusted the volume.  Hopefully they fix this in a software update.  Otherwise screen is good.  I have it integrated with our home automation so it is nice to be able to tell Alexa to turn off the basement lights etc.
 I have a problem with YouTube after about maybe a minute and a half it reverts back to the home screen and I have to reset everything to get back to the YouTube video I’m sorry but I find it very irritating and very much a problem
 I really like this upgrade but it has the same problem (if not worse) than the first generation - the Bluetooth connection sucks.  I have a Fire Tablet which I use for movies and music and when I pair with my soundbar it is perfect.  Whenever I pair the Echo Show with the soundbar it continues to cut out frequently.  I had the same problem with my first gen Echo Show but not this bad.  I had to go back to using my regular Echo with the soundbar to get a good sound again. Whatever technology they installed in the Fire tablet and the Echo I wish they would pass on the Echo Shows because it just does not work.  My whole house runs on Alexa including thermostat, sprinklers, lights, etc. so I love the overall product - just not the Bluetooth so I can not fully recommend you buy it unless Bluetooth is not important, then it is superior in every other way.
 It is definitely a great improvement over the last echo show in regards to larger screen and the sound, which is amazing. I am actually amazed by how good it sounds.<br/>With that said, the really annoying banners are a distraction, moreover actually annoying. There is no way (That I’ve been able to see) to disable them. Even though I have my own pictures on the background those annoying propaganda banner keep coming up taking away from it. I purchased the product to use as I please, not rent it or leasing it to subject to see the display of things I didn’t ask for. I paid for the product and I pay for my subscription to Amazon prime and I should be able as the owner to choose what it’s displayed on the screen at all times.<br/>Other than that it is a great device to control your home automation and to play music
 This is better I  every way to the old first generation echo show.<br/><br/>The screen is better and clearer and if you love plenty of bass, this has it. The sound field is wide and will fill your room.<br/><br/>It turns on my philps hue lights on slightly faster also.<br/><br/>If you got the old show, the  this is a worthy upgrade, everything about it is better, and for a 10" screen, because its so compact it does not look a monster like the Lenovo 10" smart screen, so love the smaller echo show form factor.

Took about 10 min to do updates and everything and since I already have a Alexa account for my other devices it was preregistered and automatically connected to internet.<br/><br/>The sound is amazing the attached video doesn’t do it justice. It has a pretty good sound wilder and IF you open a new card it’s 70 dollars off with a gift card so affectively after taxes I only paid 119 for it. You have to order by voice to get the early Black Friday price plus 10 dollars off first Alexa voice purchase then that’s how u get that 119 price line. Either way love it so far. Works perfectly with my nest camera. Takes no longer than the nest app to open up and show me on the screen.<br/><br/>Sound wise I’d say it could used some extra power in the mid range but still a very powerful speaker. That’s all based on the past hour playing with it.
 Purchased the show for my daughters  and sons for Christmas gifts because I liked mine so well. Purchased the 2 for me. Always watching a movie or talking to the kids or great grands it’s always in use. Have a show in one bedroom and bathroom also as well as dots, echos and tap scattered throughout my rather large home and love them. The 2 sits in my kitchen. So in love with these products<br/>I convinced employer to buy shows for use as intercom between offices. Perfect for yourself or as a gift. Will be gifting  2 two shows for Christmas gifts this year and more light bulbs for me. The 2 is very viewable. I especially like it has a built in hub so will be easy for gift recipients to hook up their own lights etc.  wish it came with the stand
 I have used Alexa since the first one and I am delighted with the new Echo Show. The prior generation looked dated out of the box and featured a small screen, but it was the best version of a smart home speaker out there. When I opened the box to this one, I was impressed with the stylish design, beautiful front screen with no unsightly speaker under the screen like the prior model, and crisp sound. It is a wonderful device, and if you have the prior Show, it is a worthy upgrade!
 Thought of giving a try to this new device from Amazon as an addition to echo dot. But it is just a big junk version of dot. It is not intelligent or intuitive like google home products. Never recognize the smart products by name, not performing tasks like "turn off room lights" when multiple lights are there in a single. It just keeps asking which device or telling multiple devices found. Even after updating the address in alexa app and device it is not able to find the location for weather alerts etc. On the other side if i give the same commands to google no question is asked and job is done. Will be returning this big box soon.
 We bought this for Grand Pa that can barely use a flip phone.<br/><br/>We had to create an Amazon Account for Grand Pa in order to Import Contacts for Grand Pa because there is no other way to get contacts into the unit.<br/><br/>We do NOT want Grand Pa's Echo Show using our Primary Amazon Account nor have access to our Sensitive Contacts that other people visiting Grand Pa could access.<br/><br/>So we used a wiped un-activated spare phone and added Grand Pa's contacts there. Went to import Contacts into Alexa App which was logged into Grand Pa's Amazon account and it said you need to validate your phone number. So we had to validate it with my wife's phone. Bzzt that phone is locked to another account (the account we use for our Echo Show to talk to Grand Pa with).<br/><br/>We also wanted other relatives of Grand Pa to be "dropped in on" (which is the easiest way Grand Pa could contact someone) by Grand Pa. That requires every one have an Echo Show.<br/><br/>This is NOT for Grand Pa.
 The size of the screen is a definite upgrade. The speakers sound great although 95% of the time use our surround sound speakers. This leads me to my top two complaints!<br/>1. If you're selling an upgraded item, the new and improved, make sure it can do all the previous electric did + more. Especially when customers pre-order. The new Alexa show does not connect to your surround sound speakers properly. It sounds like headphones that are not plugged in all the way.<br/>2. SUCKS to wait all year for the new product, pre-order it, pick it up and it cannot do one of the coolest features the old one did and your family uses A LOT!<br/>So now the new Alexa show is sitting on my counter waiting for an update that hopefully will fix the issue. Definitely did not need to pre- order....
 I'm disappointed with this product. It's way over priced for the amount of functions that it offers, or should I say what it is incapable of offering!<br/>I should've stuck with the regular echo for $200 cheaper!
 Nice package but really poor fidelity in sound. Bass is fluttery, grumbling at medium volume. Far from "Premium Sound". Video is excellent. Notations starting with "Try''.... are in such small print that you need to be sitting within arms reach to read easily. Backgrounds are nice but boring, especially the predominate color... pea green and faded blue. The background paintings/drawings are generally uninteresting. There is no indoor temperature sensor.  There is a way to disable/enable the camera without disabling Alexa's monitoring ability.... just ask. "Alexa" could be way more intuitive and flexible in her understanding of questions and not require rote regurgitation of question formulation on subsequent questioning or requests. There must be some way that we humans can be relieved from Alexa's demand of complete and accurate remembrance/recollection of original task setup terminology for the myriad of tasks/requests we develop over time. We are not all "Watsons" but simple Earthlings. That's my review (so far) and I'm sticking to it.
 The sound on this device is great, much better than the echo that I have. My major complaint is that the screen constantly tells you to try this, look at that, do this, do that.  It's so annoying and I've only had it for a day. I think you can turn the screen completely off but why should I have too.  Amazon needs to give it the flexibility to be customize-able and not just their way, stupid.  I personally think this will turn a lot of people off. Still undecided if I'm going to keep it.<br/><br/>11-20-18 Update  this thing is going on sale Thursday the 22nd so don't buy it until then!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazon told me today they would not refund me the difference and that I would have to return it and reorder. Stupid but what do I know.
 I, like many other reviewers, bought this because I work at home and wanted a hands-free entertainment device so I'm not delayed from things.  The video streaming commands are beyond frustrating.  I constantly have it not play things I'm requesting.  It won't pause by verbal command.  When you do pause it, if you have to do something longer than 2 minutes it closes the entire program and you have to find the episode you were watching again.  Alexa's voice is insanely loud and I can't adjust it... so after my son goes to bed I can't use it because it's so loud I don't want to wake him up since my office is right off his bedroom.  I constantly have issues with the touch screen not doing what I'm telling it to do (such as pressing play).  Disappointed to say the least since I love my Echo and thought by the second generation kinks like this would be worked out.
 I have the previous version of Show as well as this new one. The sound is much improved and the monitor is great sized compared to the original. The biggest disappointment here is with the video interaction. Simply put, its a fail. I was looking forward to the Hulu option and even signed up for a new subscription just for this device. That said, the interface is essentially non-existant. its just awful. When watching on my ipad, i can access a full schedule, but on Show, there is no such option, only a list of the channels....doesnt even show what is currently playing. this product will never succeed if they dont address this video streaming fail. sad.
 I already had an Echo Dot in my kitchen, but I thought the Echo Show would be nice to have in there so I could see timers, watch some videos, see recipes and I liked that it could act as a digital photo frame as well. The original show was pretty dated looking so I skipped it, but the (2nd gen) Echo Show looks so much better.<br/><br/>Software:<br/>This is the biggest problem with the Echo Show so I'm leading with it. The software is really designed poorly. If it has a huge 10" touch screen, why not design the software to let you use touch AND voice. Want to go to a website? You can't just click on a browser, you have to ask it to "Open Firefox" or "Open Silk". Want to quickly pull up a list of your timers currently running? You can't, you have to ask it. Want to search from a Prime Movie to watch while cooking? You have to do it with your voice and it's very cumbersome. If you're watching a video and want to set a timer, it closes out the video. When a timer is running, it's not always displayed, so you are left wondering how much time is left and have to ask her. When you use it as a photo frame (using the Prime Photos app on your phone or computer)  the photo you use is muted (no where near as nice looking as it is on the Google Home Hub) and it's constantly you to "Try asking Alexa to....". The whole thing is really poorly designed from a visual perspective. Thankfully that can be solved with software updates if Amazon tries.<br/><br/>Display:<br/>The screen is beautiful and viewable from anywhere in the room. I find it to be a good size, in fact, it was one of the reasons I didn't go with the Google Home Hub. With a 7" screen, that was just too small to be useful.<br/><br/>Sound:<br/>It's a huge upgrade from my Echo Dot. It has a nice full sound and I rarely have the volume over 40%.<br/><br/>Voice Control:<br/>It does a great job at hearing the call phrase "Alexa" from anywhere in the room and even in adjacent rooms<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good device with a lot of potential. Hardware-wise, it's top notch. Beautiful display, great sound, fits in well in a kitchen. The software is just lacking. You have to wonder if the people who designed it ever tried to use it on a regular basis. Hopefully they'll address those in future software updates.
 The Amazon Echo has not improved at all in voice recognition since the first generation. It's this bipolar extreme between good voice recognition and absolute horrific make you want to smash your head into a brick wall frustration.<br/><br/>The Echo Show for what it is supposed to be able to do is incredibly inadequate and this is something that I feel should be obvious. This is 2019. Not 1995. We live in a world where even crappy cell phones can go back to apps that were opened<br/><br/>ANYTHING that you're doing, is completely interrupted when you ask it something else, and then afterwards, there's absolutely NO WAY to get back to what you were doing without it starting over as if it totally quit the program AFTER you asked it to switch back to it.<br/><br/>For instance, there's a built in web browser (Just so you don't think this is skill-related and maybe Amazon pass the buck). Let's say I'm browsing a page.. Could be anything like. Any page. I then say "What's the weather like?" It takes me away from the page to show me the weather and say it also of course. At the end if I say "resume firefox" or whatever it literally will go to the OPENING of the browser as if I had NOTHING open.<br/><br/>Same with the Twitch skill. So I will say "open &lt;streamer&gt;" and it will open the stream. Cool. then I wanted to know the weather. Cool got the weather. But now Twitch isn't being shown, so I say "resume Twitch" ... it goes to the purple Twitch home screen "X channels you follow are online. Would you like to see them?" no. when I say resume Twitch I want you to !@&amp;*(^&amp;*^ resume what was playing before I asked what the weather was.<br/><br/>This is so basic functionality it's not even funny.<br/><br/>To continue the story, I then proceed to say "Ask twitch for &lt;streamer&gt;" TWENTY TIMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To which EVERY TIME Alexa says "I dont' recognize that streamer name" then other times it opens up Wikipedia to something completely unrelated that I DID NOT SAY. So I end up resorting to asking it to open Twitch and then tapping the options on screen as if I'm using a Tablet, completely defeating the purpose of a FREAKING VOICE ASSISTANT.<br/><br/>Now a more simpler thing. With Google Home you can say "Turn on the energize" and it knows it's in whatever room it's in so it will turn on the lights with that scene in that room. Or you can say "Turn on the energize  everywhere" and it will turn that scene on in every room in the house. OR you can say "Turn on the energize in the dining room" while in the bedroom.<br/><br/>Alexa? Not a chance. I mean yes. You set up rooms. Yes. You put Alexa in a certain room. No. She doesn't seem to know what room she's in nor can she turn on ANYTHING in that room without you being AS FULLY EXPLICIT.. "Turn on the energize in the bedroom" .. even though you're in the bedroom, because saying "Turn on the energize" is met with "There are multiple devices with that name, can you tell me which one you want?" then it's like defusing a bomb, because saying the natural response to that question "&lt;name of device&gt;" is met with "I'm sorry. I didn't understand that."<br/><br/>Basically you have to GIVE IT THE FULL COMMAND as if it has absolutely ZERO understanding of language or anything else. In other words it's primitive as a straw hut in the middle of the jungle.<br/><br/>Amazing idea, implemented boneheadedly awful. And sad to say this is why other devices are running circles around it. For all the features that Echo Show is supposed to have, it is ruined by it's complete incompetence at voice control.<br/><br/>And once you realize that you cannot even REMOTELY talk to it like you'd talk to something that even TRIES to mimick human conversation, it still won't understand you half the time, as evidence by me telling it to go to the streamer that I just said once and it understood and then it fails to understand twelve times and I have to actually just press buttons to get there because the voice command is garbage.<br/><br/>I pre-ordered the first Amazon Echo and still have it. The voice command has not improved AT ALL since then. Having a continue mode where it listens again for a follow up command is NOT better speech recognition. It's just code.<br/><br/>You need better AI, by like a billion lightyears of a long shot. If it didn't perform the basic functions of controlling the lights etc. with learnable , though less convenient commands, I would return it.<br/><br/>I don't even want to install additional skills on it because my experience using it to watch Twitch has probably taken ten years off my life. I'll just use the computer the old fashioned way because IT WORKS.
 It set itself up. Honestly, it knew which WiFi network to use and the password (assume Amazon has it stashed in the cloud somewhere under my name). So that was nice.<br/><br/>Watching Prime video works fairly well, but it can be hard to get exactly what  you want without interacting with the touch screen (or possibly the remote, haven't tried that for anything but volume). On some shows and movies, it insists on bringing up a list of episodes, which can be scrolled through by intoning "next" and "previous" over and over. Other content plays immediately, picking up wherever I left off.<br/><br/>Hooked up Hulu as well, and telling the thing to "watch Seinfeld" worked automatically, bypassing Amazon Video where I don't have the rights. It picked up where I last left off and was able to advance episodes with "next episode", but "previous episode" unceremoniously dumped me on a Hulu list. Saying "next episode" on last episode put on to another series that is apparently part of "My Stuff" on Hulu.<br/><br/>Added the Echo Recast for off-the-air, which also works fairly well, but oddly enough it tries to launch Hulu to watch CBS. That doesn't work as I don't have Hulu Live. Oddly, NBC loads right up and ABC presents a poser: use Recast or Hulu. Telling it "1" for Recast works, but it would be nice if it would remember such decisions (with an interface to reset defaults). Using the "channel guide" command shows all of the expected channels (including CBS), so it's a bit of a mystery as to why it thinks CBS is only available on Hulu.<br/><br/>As for YouTube, the first command I tried was "watch cat videos" to see how bad the YT experience would be (thanks to a feud between Google and Amazon). Should have realized that the command didn't invoke YT at all. Later on asking for YT content, I was asked to choose between Silk or Firefox browsers. Choosing the former allowed for using YT through the touch screen. Suspect content integration is non-existent, though it should be able to at least search. Haven't bothered as YT is mostly a waste of time anyway.<br/><br/>Interfaces with the usual Alexa suspects of shopping (of course), checking the calendar, managing lists, setting alarms and timers, listening to music (now with lyrics), reading Kindle books, etc. are enhanced considerably by the screen. Phone calls worked as expected with an added visual interface; same for home automation. However, it seems that most 3rd party skills do not take advantage of the screen.<br/><br/>Speaking of home automation, I don't see a visual interface for setting scenes, but suspect they will work through voice.<br/><br/>No sign of notifications. Every other Alexa device I have lights up and beeps to indicate a new message. Would seem like a no-brainer to put these on the screen. Or perhaps the rotating display on the home screen covers these sorts of missives (mostly shopping related).<br/><br/>Sound is great, video looks great as well (though 720p I think).<br/><br/>Certainly this is the best alarm clock ever.
 I upgraded from the Echo Show - 1st Gen to the Echo Show - 2nd Gen. The 1st gen software was upgraded to the same as the 2nd gen, so if you have the 1st, you won't need to upgrade to the 2nd to use the new software features unless.. you want the full screen and a much better sound experience.<br/><br/>The 1st gen device configuration was very poor with its boxy appearance and annoyingly prominent speaker location.  The full screen presentation of the 2nd gen combined with the speaker moved to the rear is a winner and in my opinion, that alone is worth the upgrade but then I just like new electronics.  The 2nd gen device looks better on the counter, it's sharp and easier to see text from across the kitchen because the screen is larger. The software update also centered the announcements on the screen which adds to the new look and makes it easier to read on the larger screen.
 I'm being a little favorable and grading this on a curve with credit for the potential that it has.  If I could I'd give it a 4.5 stars (4 stars for today, .5 stars because it has load of potential.<br/><br/>Display: Excellent. It's big and I felt it was going to be too awkward at first because of the size but once I started using it the size of the display (and the unit) were more spot on.<br/><br/>Interface: Good, customizable.  Scrolls information if you want and adjusts based on lighting and activity around it (i.e. turns off/dims when dark and not active). Can control quite a few things including lights from the interface and also does a great job with video and other media both with displays and control.  Alexa works well in displaying information in usable forms (lists, links, data, video clips, etc). While I can control lighting, I found Google Home hub has a better interface for controlling things; just easier to get to and very easy/quick to turn on and off things in the same room.  I have not used any of the video calling etc. but from what I've seen that's pretty solid.<br/><br/>Sound: This thing sound great.  Full sound.  Not going to replace any high end systems for music or movies but it's good.  I tend to use it for audiobooks when I'm doing work around the house moreso than anything else and it's great for that.<br/><br/>Amazon still hasn't integrated things like Ring into this as well as is should.  As a comparison, the Google Home Hub integrates excellent with Nest. Someone ring the nest doorbell and it immediately shows the camera, it very quick with accessing other cameras or the thermostat.  I think it will get there and when it does it potentially will be better as I think the hardware is better (faster, better display, etc).
 *UPDATE* When I got this device, I brought my old Show over to my parents, who are in their 80s. They had a Dot before, so they weren't totally new to the devices. I had showed them how to call me on the Dot, and they used it to call other family members too.<br/><br/>Once we got the Shows in both homes, it wasn't long before they were dropping in on me on a regular basis. I thought, at first, that it might be intrusive but there is a CLEAR tone that someone is dropping in and you have about 15-30 seconds before the view comes in to focus.<br/><br/>I love it. They just dropped in to find out when we would be traveling to see them. My mom told me about the cookies she made and I could see my dad eating them LOL. I like to be able to drop in on them to see how they are. When I'm away from home, I like to drop in on my own house to see what's going on and make sure it's all OKAY there.<br/><br/>It might take a bit to get your elderly parents set up on the Show but it's totally worth it. You can restrict access to certain times or completely. It's done by contact, not device. You can also set it up to go to your cell phone, I believe, with the Alexa app.<br/><br/>So, my update is not just about the device itself (but the newest Show is AWESOME ... I didn't know if it was worth upgrading but it IS) but also about it's functionality with faraway loved ones :)<br/><br/>The sound is AMAZING! A huge step up from the previous Show. I love the bigger screen!
 tl;dr -- If you're buying this just for yourself to use, will probably work well.  If you're trying to make it work for someone else in your Household, it's a nightmare.<br/><br/>I bought the new Echo Show for my daughter (who lives with her mom) so that we could video call.  We had previously made M an Amazon Teen account (CID-Teen), which gave her access to watch Prime video content, and shop as an Amazon prime member.  I am also a Prime Music Unlimited subscriber.  Amazon Music won't let her use her Teen account play music, so we had to create a new account just for that purpose (CID-Music).<br/><br/>The Alexa app would not let her Sign-In with her Teen Account. Then we tried removing her from the household (CID-Teen-&gt;CID-Normal).  She could then Sign-In to the Alexa app, but lost the ability to play videos, music, or shop as a prime member.<br/><br/>Then we tried to Sign-In with my account (CID-Parent), and add her as a comms profile (CID-Comms).  This initially failed because the mobile login claim (phone number) was associated with another CID.  We called support to get the number free'd up.  Once we were able to create the comms profile and Sign-In, we realized that this isn't a real solution either, as she now has all of the devices for my home (lights, tv's, etc) in her Alexa companion app, as opposed to just the Echo Show device that I bought for her.<br/><br/>4 calls to support, ~90 minutes wasted talking to CSAs.  No real solution available. Ugh.
 I got this so I could monitor my father at his home. First issue, without a smartphone, he couldn't set it up. In fact you have to have a cell number to link the account to. Okay, did that but I have had so many issues getting it to connect. For some reason, I always have to repeat his name; adding contacts is convoluted: adding a neighbor -- we set up the Alexa app on the neighbor's telephone and I confirmed it is working from there. Can't add the neighbor as a drop-in allowed contact.<br/><br/>This product is too difficult to set up and use. I have been with support multiple times. Perhaps I have too many Amazon devices and it gets confused but use case is simply an Amazon Fire Tablet with Echo Show base and this Echo Show and I can't connect with any consistency. Good idea but needs to be simplified to work and set up. One should be able to set it up on EITHER phone or PC web page. There needs to be consistency between alexa.amazon.com and the app as far as contacts are concerned or it needs to propagate immediately. Users shouldn't have to have to install alexa app to use the device. Or if they do, then at least make it easy without needing double identification setting up the app. This device is just too confusing for the average person to set up (and I would consider myself especially tech savvy).
 I bought this so i could video call on Skype and or face time or any other video chatting software and you can only video call alexa show to alexa show install the alexa app.  It seems a little ridiculous that you cant call any other platforms?  I am going to get the Facebook Portal instead because at least it uses a platform that is adopted.  Please let me know if I am missing something!
 If you hope to be able to visually monitor incoming telephone calls by using this in conjunction with an Echo Connect, forget about it. I have two Echo Show 2nd Generation units and two Echo Show 1st Generation units  and none of them show od say who is calling either with a name or a telephone number. All the screen shows and a voice says is "Incoming Call" with no visual or audio indication as to who is calling. Apparently, these features used to work but they no longer work. The Echo Connect is also supposed to announce the caller information on Echo units that don't have a screen, but that doesn't work either. For more information see the Amazon Forum about this issue. It looks like Amazon Tech Support ahs dropped the ball on getting this fixed. I just spent an hour on the phone with Amazon Tech Support and it looks like they haven't done much or anything to solve this problem<br/>Check out the bottom of page 2 and all of page 3 on this Amazon Forum to read complaints that started on October 31, 2018:<br/>https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/echo-alexa/476517-echo-connect-talking-caller-id-not-working?page=2
 now my feeble old mom can use google calendar.  The kids are happy sitting at the counter watching dora..  or I can watch football.<br/><br/>The main reason I got it was because my mom lloooooollolves to write stuff on a Calandar at home.  The problem is..  I have no visibility of this at work.<br/><br/>She complained that she has to work visually...  so she didn't like entering a shopping list on my amazon Tap.<br/><br/>Problem solved.  She just says alexa. Add apples to the shopping list.  Boom.  Then later.. she can say alexa show me the shopping list.  Boom.  Visual.  AND I can see it on my phone on the way home and I can pick stuff up.<br/><br/>Same play with ToDo list.
 I would give this device a much higher rating if the battle between Amazon and Google didn't interfere with it's operation. As it is the echo show is limited in capabilities such as not being able to play Netflix, browsing capabilities. Everything you search on google takes you to an Amazon page. So forget trying to buy something elsewhere. It's the customers who buy these devices who suffer. Pretty sad when you pay for something and are short changed because of a squabble between 2 corporations. Then there is the fact of learning to use it. A manual in the form of a downloadable pdf file would help immensely. Hopefully they will upgrade and improve this device so it is compatible with and will play well with services other than Amazon. Otherwise I would consider buying other devices. It has some nice features and the sound is good but it could be so much better. For that reason I feel Amazon is making a mistake in not bringing this product to it's full potential. People will buy Google Home Hub, Facebook Portal, Lenovo Smart Display and others if Amazon doesn't get wise.
 These were very expensive given the fact that they come with this mini 7 page manual that doesn't explain anything. When I tried to call support,  I was connected to someone overseas. If you've ever experienced this there's no need for me to explain the frustration.  If they don't want all 4 of the echo shows I just purchased returned, a native English speaker will contact me via the phone number connected to my account.
 I wanted a smart home assistant with a video display that showed me a feed of my smart cameras (specifically my Ring doorbell) and that functioned as a digital picture frame.<br/>So the Amazon Echo Show does show me the feed of my Ring doorbell, but my expectations were the Echo Show to display the feed if someone rang the doorbell. It's a bit cumbersome needing to ask "Alexa" to show the camera IF you know that someone is at the door.  Ideally, this functioned more like the Nest doorbell + Google home mini hub. It's kind of a head scratcher why this feature wasn't included as it's a pretty common use case people would expect to have.<br/>My 2nd complaint is that it does not continuously cycle through my Amazon photos.  After a while, it just stays on one photo.  I've read that unplugging/plugging in the device would cycle through the photos again (or asking "Alexa" to play slideshow).<br/>Knowing what I know now, I probably would have opted for a Nest doorbell to go with my Google home mini hub for my home video surveillance needs (although I would still be using the less expensive Echo devices since I prefer "Alexa" voice commands) and skipped purchasing this.<br/>What I like about the device is that it's loud, bright, the on screen display for light controls and the rotating photo display (when it works).
 I have had to reset this device almost every time I play my Pandora stations. I will say "Alexa stop", no luck, "Alexa off", again no luck. Occasionally it will appear to stop playing Pandora music but when I come back later and ask to play again I am told Pandora is already playing, but there is no music playing.<br/><br/>Added the Echo Sub and that was another layer of fun. It works when it wants to. Most of the time I end up having to delete the pairing and go through the painful steps of creating a new sub pair, then repeat it sometimes the same day, others a day or two later.<br/><br/>Amazon released these devices way before they were ready for prime time! I have to admit the sound is great when they are working together but the time I spent making them work is really worth the sound quality improvements.<br/><br/>Hopefully Amazon is working on some software updates that make this product pair a much more enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>Until there is some improvements in both products software I can't recommend either.
 The lack of customization of the home screen is seriously appalling.<br/><br/>The default time display is tiny. I can't read it from more than 5 feet away. And you can't configure the size!<br/>The weather display is even smaller. Again can't change anything about that.<br/>At most times, about 85% of the screen real estate is wasted.  But you can't configure it to be useful in any way.<br/><br/>Shame on Amazon for shipping out such an incomplete product.<br/><br/>I would definitely not recommend buying the Echo Show.
 I've had the Show for a little over a week. This thing has great potential, but it sorely needs a software update. If you think about it, it really does not do anything useful. Most of the time it just sits there. You need to be able to customize the home screen background and size of the time / weather. It could be a fantastic, basic, smart home controller, but it fails on that part. You need to be able to map addresses. You need an option to not show this "Try" nonsense at the bottom of the screen - that is just veiled advertising. It needs more thought put into accessibility features. I just tried: "Alexa, show me the nearest pizza places" as prompted by one of their "Try …" suggestions. It showed me 8 sample pizza offerings from different places, but did not state the distance. I tapped on one of the pizza offerings, it showed the distance, but would not let me map the location. If I want to order a pizza I would have to go to my computer – why bother with the Show?
 I wouldn't waste my money on this again unless someone else you know already has one. Just get the Facebook portal where you can call/video and it has alexa built in. This product is not worth it and I would return it if they didn't have a 7 day return policy. Doesn't even play the songs I ask it to either (using VEVO). Supposedly you can video chat on skype but surprise you have to pay for it! AND it doesn't even work. You would think being the 2nd generation that it would be a lot better than what it is. I own 4 other echo devices and the only thing different about this one is you can see/hear what its talking about rather than just hearing it.
 We recently received the Echo Show 2 as a gift. The sound quality is much better than the Echo Spots we have. Also being able to visually see multiple timers is very handy. Honestly I am extremely disappointed that I can not read my kindle cookbooks on the Echo Show. Sure you can have it read to you in Alexa's robotic voice but that isn't practical. I think not being able to access the kindle books is a huge flaw! If they would allow full access to your Kindle library that would make this product much more useful. Also would be handy to have icons for skills on a home screen because lets be honest some skills require very specific wording that doesn't roll of the tongue naturally. Overall it isn't terrible but it is missing some key features. If we had not received this as a gift we would not have purchased this unless they added those missing key features.
 The Echo Show is a good addition to my echo ecosystem. I have the original Echo, Echo Dot, Echo 2, and the Fire TV Cube. I wish I can give this more stars.<br/>Pros: the screen is clear the integration with my ring doorbell and some of my other cameras are great and the Hub features very convenient.<br/>Cons: the sound quality if the screen is facing you the sound is not that great if you're facing the speakers the sound is amazing. The other issue I've had is my microphone there's 8 microphones and it still has a problem hearing is especially if the TV is on but my Fire TV queue which is right next to the TV here's me very well.<br/>I think with a few software updates they can make this unit great and I can give him more stars. Also still waiting for some of the features that it will promise but it's still not activated.
 Netflix is not supported by this device. Unable to use Facebook messenger on the echo show 2. This device sucks. I expected more from this device, I really wanted to like it.
 Terrible!!! Doesn’t “listen” as well as other devices. And if you want to use it for music eat all, the speakers/sound quality is far worse than a dot or other.
 I've been curious about these Echo products for a few years but we waited, hoping to let Amazon work out some of the security kinks first. I came across a great cyber Monday sale and so we decided to give it a try. I wanted this one specifically for my kitchen, for recipes and videos. I read up a lot on it in advance, how to speak to it etc. There is a definitely some training on both sides. I approached it with patience as I figured out the right way to ask it do what I wanted. My husband (who normally hates technology) quickly took to it and loved it.<br/><br/>It has a long way to go yet as far as being a bit more intuitive. There are moments I'm glad it has a screen, when it gets befuddled over "return to the song" (or something silly) I can just walk over and tap the screen to get what I want. Sometimes it trips over itself. But, I can have my hands in the oven and baking and ask "Alexa, set timer for 6 minutes" (you can set multiple timers with different names - whaaaat?) while I'm watching some random tv show or news, or listening to music. "Alexa, how many tablespoons are in a half cup" or "...set a reminder pick up my prescription", "add garlic to my shopping list" "what's on my to do list for tomorrow?" Catch my drift? I really have found it super handy.  I also listen to MORE music. I pay for Amazon music subscription but really only listened on my phone at the gym etc. Now on a whim, I find I come home from work and ask "Alexa, play radiohead" or something random while I'm taking off my coat, and voila! The quicker/easier access to music makes me utilize the service so much more.<br/><br/>I'm still a bit wary of the security, so I've left some things out. I didn't connect my contact list, as I wouldn't want an accidental call to go out to someone while we're having too many glasses of wine at 11pm. No one needs that. The drop in thing is no-go for me. I locked down as much as I could on that stuff. I like that there is a mute button I can press when I don't want her to listen, but we haven't used that as much as we thought we would. I've used it when talking "about her" to someone else on the phone (she kept piping into the conversation with her confusion, LOL. MUTE it Alexa.)<br/><br/>There's also a ton I still haven't tried. I haven't done any shopping on it. I haven't used it for smart home items. I haven't even used the Skype. And I STILL use it constantly and feel like its been impactful in our home.<br/><br/>All in all, a few gaps to work around so not nearly seamless, but otherwise, it's truly changed our kitchen experience for the better. So many neat little features. I rated it 5 stars based on how awesome this technology is and how great it is at some of these features. I was tempted to go 4 because it has so much further to go, but that didn't seem fair. It's a new technology. I grew up in a world before cell phones - so when I compare that and consider how far this has all come? 5 stars.
 The quality of the video and the sound is great.  We can view our lists, weather info, recipes, videos, our photos, etc.  We haven't had our Echo Show very long so we are still discovering new uses.  We will be adding a Ring doorbell to our system in the next few weeks.  And my wife loves the Sandstone color.  I would have preferred it in Charcoal but I don't always get what I want.  HaHa
 I've been using the Echo devices since their inception.  I was fortunate enough to get into an early adoption queue.<br/><br/>It's amazing how embedded into my daily life these things have become.  I use them for so many things - from morning repeating reminders to get my son his ADD medicine to timers for cooking and my favorite, adding things to my shopping list.  I love being able to just ask for a song and have it play.<br/><br/>Weather forecasts, current temp outside, news synopsis...  It has become such an integral part of our household.<br/><br/>The Echo Show was a nice addition, I liked the screen, especially when it came to monitoring multiple timers, or being able to look at lists without having to use the app.  But it was a bit small for use across the room, so some things I didn't ask unless I was closer to it.<br/><br/>This new one removes that restriction.  Screen is huge, seeing the two side by side is just amazing.  It's bigger than I had expected just from reading the specs and measurements.  Screen is vibrant and crisp, text is clear and photos are well displayed.<br/><br/>My son loves that there are so many genres of jokes he can ask.<br/><br/>I love that the Echo is one of the central parts of my automated home.  Switches all over the house, lights, thermostat and video cameras - I love being able to just ask to see a camera and seeing it, or turning lights on and off, or changing the temperature of the house.  I was happy before the Echo devices to be able to do all that from the cell phone, but it's even more useful now that the Echo can control so many things.  Works well with IFTTT but I still prefer the skills where it can directly access something.<br/><br/>There just isn't a downside.  I'm passing my V1  Echo Show to my mother, who also received my V1 Echo when I upgraded to the newer little cylinder tower for the V2 Echo.  And I've given her my old V1 dot when I got the newer dot.  It's nice having them in a few places around the house.  The dot in my bedroom is my only alarm clock I use anymore, despite having a nice Philips glow light wakeup system...  It is just so much easier to say, "Alexa, set alarm for 6 AM," than to hit the buttons on the alarm clock.  Especially when you're setting different times for different days.<br/><br/>And even for napping sometimes - just tell it what time to sound the alarm, and take a little nap without worrying about napping too long and screwing up your sleep schedule.<br/><br/>Worth every penny for my household, wouldn't be without one anymore...
 It has a great array of working items, combined with so many that don't you find yourself not trusting it.<br/>Once the trust is broken you stop using it. You stop asking questions to Alexa, effectively disabling the point of owning the device.<br/><br/>I'm happy with the purchase because I was told the speaker system on this version was the best. It absolutely is. It is room filling, with tons of bass. It's quite amazing, really.<br/><br/>There's a few things like timers, and lists that work better with a visual display, but it feels like they haven't worked on Alexa's vocabulary or fields of understanding at all. She says she doesn't know to a LOT of things.<br/><br/>Hulu, does not work for me. I'm seeing a good mix of people who say it does and some saying it doesn't, but it will not connect to my login. It is also unstable at the login screen.<br/>There's a 'screen captcha' anti-bot segment to the login.<br/>I went through this thing 6 times.. At first it would barely load. It did seem to speed up, and I changed my login just to make sure I had a very simple one for the interface.<br/>If you get through the captcha with the correct login and password, it tells you that 'Hulu is not available at this time. Try again later.'<br/><br/>I had a first attempt get stuck on this screen and not allow me to go back into the login section. I reset to factory defaults to get it back.<br/><br/>This device.. It feels like an early 2000's piece of tech. It doesn't have that apple slick feel to it where everything just works, and obviously they released it slightly unpolished.<br/><br/>I also can't get my nest thermostat to link.<br/>There's a huge lack of slickness to the pairing of external devices and services that I find very disappointing. Considering how simplified and scaled down a device this is, what exactly is it if it can't operate external devices particularly well and doesn't do as much as a tablet?<br/><br/>We also own the 4K firetv cube, and the same problem happens. It wants you to be able to use it hands free, and encourages you to try, but because many of the things it wants you to do don't yet work well, (such as navigation and being stuck in netflix with no way to tell it to navigate towards the title called "bah blah", and having her tell you she doesn't know what the hell you mean), you realize immediately that it doesn't work well enough to let you do anything that the very first original echo could do, so, err.. Why does it exist?<br/><br/>For the cube, you immediately go back to the remote, and for the show, you realize that you just got an original echo with a screen, and you won't be using it for anything else.<br/><br/>For me, it's a decent bluetooth speaker that gives good weather reports.<br/><br/>I like the speaker.. I like all the original things I liked about the original echo, but the visualization and video apps are currently being wasted.<br/>They would have been better off merging a full tablet with alexa, then at least you could navigate to and use hulu, and a web browser, etc etc while they catch up with her abilities.<br/><br/>I'll update my review if they update and fix some problems. I really see a future in this series, but they need to slow it down and get it working better before crossing a platform into visual with a format that can't take advantage of it yet.<br/>It causes disappointment and brand wariness.<br/><br/>*update*<br/>I attempted to login to hulu once again, and it simply worked right away.<br/>No idea what the issue was, but there was no delay. Just straight in.<br/>Also, I finally got my nest thermostat to pair. If I was of a suspicious mind, I would think it had something to do with my bad review that Amazon then contacted me over :D<br/>Deals a deal though. I'll raise the stars to 3 and hope they will work on her abilities that she has right now, not continuously add trinkets to a half working idea.
 I own two of the first generation Echo Shows.  I love them both.  Upgrading to the 2nd generation was a no brainer with the larger screen and speaker.  However, the Show still has a ways to go before Amazon gets it right.<br/><br/>1. Yes, speaker is larger and more powerful but you lose the intended effect when the speaker points away from you.  The actual sound experience for someone standing in front of the Show is a disappointment and actually felt more like a downgrade.  Amazon needs to address the directional flow of sound better.  The round Echo's are great in terms of projecting sound throughout the room because of it's shape and position of speakers. . . obviously.  The Show is too directional and moving sound away from you is not an upgrade in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>2.  Tried the video call yesterday and I was shocked.  Streaming can be fairly choppy and reminiscent of some of the first web cams that came out onto the market.  Low resolution. . . Don't expect to see anywhere close to the same quality streaming as you will get watching something from the Amazon library.  Amazon dropped the ball on this one.<br/><br/>I was hoping to pick up additional units as gifts, but at this point, I'll wait until next year to see how Amazon improves upon this year's mode.  While I love the larger screen, I would not recommend an upgrade unless you really want the larger screen and don't mind turning the Show around to benefit from the larger speakers.<br/><br/>And finally. . . Amazon decided to take a picture of my package at the front door with a link that asks me how I feel about posting a picture online.  Seriously?  While the picture is only visible in my account, my first thought was that they're trying to move away from any culpability if thieves steal from your house.  I have an enclosed patio, out of site from the street.  What's to keep a dishonest delivery person from picking up the package after it's been documented online as delivered?  Not everyone may feel this way, but it felt like a violation of privacy and an effort which came across a little too aggressive and with no explanation.  If Amazon is that concerned, require a signature.  I'd rather pick it up at the post office the next day than to have a level of risk which clearly leans against the customer if delivery issues arise.
 There is a delay in audio from my iPad to the Echo Show via Bluetooth so when I play video on the iPad, the sound from the Echo Show doesn’t sync with the video. I didn’t have this problem on the original Echo Show. The 2nd gen Echo Show screen is definitely larger and more vibrant.<br/><br/>Overall it’s not that useful unless you are going to watch something directly on it. It has Prime Video, Hulu and for some reason, NBC. Without Netflix, this makes it a light offering. The content (like news stories) it pushes out is rarely relevant to me. If you like following cooking recipes on tv, then this is probably good for the kitchen.<br/><br/>Alexa has all the same problems she has on every other Echo device, most frustratingly she can barely answer questions about what the device can do. Instead she either refers you to a help section that mysteriously isn’t available on the device itself even though it has a screen or she just says something like, “Hm, I don’t know that.” One improvement on Alexa’s shopping skills, particular to this device, is that you can look at the products, though it’s a narrow set.
 I waited about a month to see how I liked it and I can tell you that I neither love it or hate it. The echo show is just OK. I bought this to replace our original echo and I really don't think it sounds as good. I have played a lot with the equalizer to try and make it sound better but still has a funny bass sound and just doesn't sound like I would like it. It doesn't sound bad just not as clear as I had hoped.<br/>I was also hoping that it would also do better at picking up voice commands but does about the same as the old unit. The addition of the screen is nice sometimes but not as much as I was thinking. It can also be very distracting for little kids that tend to be drawn to screens. I am always telling the unit to turn off the screen.<br/>Probably the most annoying thing is the volume control. It would be nice if it could normalize the volume. Different apps YouTube, Amazon music, etc. all play at different volumes. You also can not control the volume of her voice separately from the main volume. So if you have to turn up the volume high to hear a video on YouTube or another app the voice volume is crazy loud. It would be nice to have a system (voice) volume control separate from the main volume. Maybe this will be fixed with an system update or something in the future.
 Screen has light bleed issues and backlight consistently issues<br/><br/>EDIT<br/>the screen is literal trash, i watch movies on it from prime video and the backlight is so bad. From the Gen1 they made some progress with the screen-glass distance but in putting a larger screen they made it of poor quality. This screen would be fine for a $50 tablet but not for this price. i know Amazon can do better We have seen it on the more expensive tablets (still cost less than echo show gen 2). Also in putting a larger screen amazon forgot to upgrade the RAM, GPU and CPU as a result this model is slower then last year's. Amazon took 2 steps forward and 3 steps back<br/><br/>Edit<br/>My unit was defective and all issues involving the screen have been fixed! That being said this is an excellent way to control smart home. Passive bass radiator makes all the difference!<br/>I wouldn't go as far as to say that amazon hit a home run with this one but they are light years ahead of the market/competition with this one.
 The sound is very impressive, I was not expecting it to be as good as it is.  We use it to listen to both Amazon Music and SiriusXM and it certainly doesn't disappoint even with the so-so quality of some of the Sirius channels.<br/>We have several 'smart' plugs and switches in our home and this device makes it easy to control them all from one room using your voice or pulling up the list of devices on the screen and interacting with them that way.  It is really helpful for managing a large number of connected devices.<br/>I recently activated the 'intercom' feature for use with our old Echo 1st gen.  I put the older Echo downstairs so that my spouse could communicate easily with me upstairs on the Echo Show if she wanted to (she just had a baby).  This feature seems to be working well.<br/>We also often use it for recipes, our Echo Show is on the kitchen counter.  While the recipe displaying functions are great, the Alexa service is lacking in how it searches for recipes.  Many times if will hear you correctly, but present you with a list of recipes that are nowhere near to what you asked for.<br/>We have also used this device to quickly look up a product that we might quickly need for the baby or for mommy and it seems to do well in that regard, presenting you with relevant items.<br/>Aside from that, it is also great at the general Alexa-type stuff; weather, sports scores, etc.<br/>One kind of odd thing I noticed is that after enabling the 'messaging' (intercom) feature, skills I was using that had the word 'text' in their intent requests wouldn't work; the Alexa service would recognize the word 'text' and hijack the intent, ignoring the context of the rest of the user's input and instead asking you who you would like to text message.  Not cool.
 Got 2 on Black Friday. Heres my review and criticisms of this device. Im confused and conflicted about this device. I feel like Amazon knows they need to improve on the software. Pros : Sounds amazing - 11/10. Like seriously, the bass on this thing is wow. It's really clear.<br/><br/>Now onto the cons.. On my phone, I can touch anywhere, and get a response. There needs to be a back button, there needs to be swipe functionality, like from the bottom up on an iPhone.  Im touching parts of the UI on the Show expecting it to do something, and Im frustrated that I can/cant click on certain things that are or arent obvious. There needs to be a Device list similiar to how I control my devices via my Android on my phone.<br/><br/>I can say Alexa (show) turn on Philips Hue. I get the Device, it pops up. I even get a brightness bar. But I cant view any of these devices whatsoever in the 30 Internet-of-thing type devices I have connected to the Alexa ecosystem. What. Why? I dont have friends. I dont use this for making calls or video calls. Thats what phones are for. This product should really be relagated or somehow updated via software to include alot of the features lacking.<br/><br/>The homescreen is extremely limited. There needs to be way more access to font sizes, font types, what shows up on the home screen. I mean come on, Google killed it. There needs to be options for screen "timeout". Just take a page from Android 9.0 or whatever.<br/><br/>If Amazon takes into account these comments seriously - and I think they do, especially with the always learning doomsday robot named Alexa, she'll probably write code just based on reading this comment.<br/><br/>Edit (1 hour later) - Seems Amazon does take these comments seriously. I got a phone call - asking for feedback. Not even an hour after posting this review. I further explained my situation. Interesting. Gave them more feedback on the ecosystem. I think it really comes down to Software. The hardware is great. Few other things mentioned. Im still unsure whether I will be keeping the device. It is cool to note that they do (for obvious reasons, they read the comments) just wasn't expecting a call or anyone to care or read. As busy as they are, and to receive a followup call. Hope my voice recorded feedback helps, Mr. Bezos.
 I love my Echo Show (1st Generation) so why not the Generation 2? Since countless reviews have focused on the big and beautiful screen, my comments are added here:<br/>1. No doubt this is a gorgeous screen. The small clock typeface has been fixed, although much to my surprise, there is little to no clock customization. Worse, the only background "themes" are the simplistic (and very tiring) "illustrations" and no background at all. What happened to the wonderful photos I have on my Show 1st Generation? This is Amazon's star product; I would have expected all kinds of new customization features and details. I settled for my folder "Album" of various photos that I have in my Amazon Photos app. Just say "Alexa, add this album to my background" and they will cycle every 1 minute or so (and no, there does appear to be any way to cycle these any faster...). Any yes, as another reviewer stated, an entirely different background pops up with an ad or notification.<br/>2. The loud Alexa voice has been fixed I have read. I don't really like the side and rear speaker placement however - poor Alexa sounds as if she is within a box. The sound is indeed louder with an accentuated bass (and a three-level equalizer, woohoo!) but the music is missing a clear location. It sounds diffuse and non-distinct.<br/>3. The worst surprise was this irritating screen-goes-blank after 2 minutes feature, which is carried over from the 1st Generation. Why does this happen? I can no longer see lyrics or title or the art after the screen dies. Arrgghh.<br/>4. No Youtube. We all know why but that doesn't make it any better. And no, the Silk/Firefox work-around is just stupid. Just make up (Google and Amazon) and bring the native YouTube back!<br/><br/>In retrospect, I'm glad I have them both. The 2nd Generation will take over the kitchen and the 1st Generation goes with me to work.<br/><br/>Why all the critical comments despite the 4-stars? Because the new Echo Show is placed right next to my Lenovo Smart Display, which has a seamless Youtube and great sound/screen as well. The 2nd Generation Echo Show is just so much nicer than the Smart Display which was one of the biggest disappointments for me in 2018.<br/><br/>Amazon can quickly fix most of all these nit-picking comments in future updates. Give us more customizations in the GUI (backgrounds, themes, clock styles like the Echo Spot), fix the blank-screen irritation, and PLEASE bring back Youtube!
 I was really looking forward to getting the Echo Show so I could stream videos hands free in the kitchen while cooking.<br/>Unfortunately, the show falls short in this category, so I have returned my device.  For a device that has such a great video screen it seriously lacks support for video streaming.  There is no native support for YouTube, Netflix or any of the major streaming services, except Hulu.  You can access them through the Show's internet browser, but you can't use voice commands to do this, which completely defeats the point of having the Show.  Because of the limited streaming options that are available with voice activation I am giving the Echo Show only 2 stars.<br/><br/>If you want a device for your kitchen that will let you stream videos from your favorite services a better option would be to get a Kindle Fire HD 10 put it in Show mode and hook up some decent speakers or to get a small TV and attach a Fire TV Stick.<br/><br/>The sound quality is really good, but not as good as the Echo Plus.
 Bought this to help my father (who has Parkinsons Disease and whose hands are not longer able to operate a CD player) listen to his language learning CDs (which I ripped to MP3 and then uploaded to Amazon Music).<br/><br/>Amazon - after touting this exact feature (" You can listen to all your music!") - then abruptly hobbled Amazon Music so you can no longer use it to play your own uploaded music, even if you bought it legally from Amazon in the first place (as I did). No explanation, just dropped it.<br/><br/>If you want to play exactly what Amazon tell you you can listen to, then this might work. And if you want an easier way to spend more money on Amazon, then go ahead. But they've hobbled Amazon Music and who knows what else they may just decide to drop from the Echo if it doesn't match their business objectives in the future.<br/><br/>Customer centric company? Alexa tells me different.
 This was my first Echo device with a screen (next to my Amazon Tablet), so I can't comment on any improvements screen-wise from previous Show's, but I can talk about improvements over my first generation Echo devices. The speaker has a richer sound than my 1st generation Echo. I've placed the show in my kitchen, but the far field microphone array seems to be able to hear me from across the room and even into the room next door. I've found the screen helpful for displaying flash briefing video content as well as my Amazon Prime Video content. I love that the next events on my calendar also show up as well as reminders. This is a great start if you've never owned an Echo device, but also makes a great addition to your existing setup (I've got two dots, an Echo, a Fire tablet, and now the Show).
 Cannot get ring spot lite camera to show on screen! Picks up signal and says there was a detection. iPad does all and the video is there. I am versed in works and cannot figure out the problem. All units operate on same net and pass. Amazon techs are also baffled. They say reset the Ring but it is up 25 ft. and how come phone and IPad works?
 I purchased this product for my grandfather who loves his echo dot. This is a surprise gift for his Christmas. The show was packaged great, it felt like I was opening a new iPhone. The setup couldn't have been simpler, as I don't really like the Alexa app. Everything was done on the screen and there was no need for the app. I did mess up the setup by mistyping my phone number and that led me to call Amazon but they were able to fix that quickly. I was quite impressed with the overall build quality, the speakers were loud and it has decent bass. Also, the screen brightness automatically adjusts to fit surroundings, so when I wake up I am not blinded. I purchased this with the Wyze Cam $5 addon, and I will leave a review there for that. But the ability to pull up cameras (this is my first show) and see them it fantastic. I couldn't be happier with this Show.
 There is a problem with these units if you want to rotate your pictures from Amaxon Prime in the background. If you have pictures you have uploaded to Amazon Prime and now want to view them in the background on your new Amazon Echo device, forget it. The pictures will rotate for about an hour and then STOP.  You have to unplug the unit and re-start it if you want the Echo Show to go for another hour or so rotating pictures in the background. This does not happen on “some” units, but most, if not all, the units. Google it.  As long as you don’t mind not having you photos rotate in the background, it’s a great unit.
 I was interested in the first generation of the Show, but since I have a functioning Echo (1st gen) and Dot (1st gen), I thought I would wait for this 2nd Generation Show.  I think it is absolutely wonderful.  My original plan was to put it in the kitchen but in the end I swapped out the Echo in my bedroom and put the Show in there.  I find that the dimming function makes the display on the Show so soothing that sleeping in the same room is no problem.  The sound is great.  I replaced the background with a picture of my own choosing and I find at least some of the rolling screen suggestions worth taking.  If I need it in the kitchen, I can always pick it up and move it there.  I bought it in the Amazon store in my local mall.
 I've had the show a few days and wanted to use it like a second/portable tv for streaming tv and movies. I thought a screen could "screen" almost anything - nope.  Even though others have reviewed the limitations of the show, it was difficult for me to picture how a device so beautiful could be so useless for streaming video.<br/><br/>I can't get flash and netflix to work on it through chrome. This means I can't get my cable tv and online dvr to play from the xfinity website on this device. I just don't see how I can use this unless I fork over hundreds of dollars to purchase prime videos and tv. Even though I have prime and the first season of a show is listed as free - the show told me I needed to go to the webiste and pay for the tv show in order to watch it.<br/><br/>So, if you are happy watching whatever show manges to scrounge up for you or you really want this for video conferencing/camera monitoring, I would give this a hard pass. Yes, the sound is decent but I tried placing mine against a wall (normal) and the sounds is awful and bounces of the wall. This really needs to be placed a couple of feet away from a wall. Incidentally, the stand you can buy for this fits perfectly and works well.<br/><br/>Disappointing and confusing device.
 Alexa tries to make me watch Psych no matter what show I ask for.  Clearly not ready for the market.  Sending it back<br/><br/>I will be sending mine back.  The sound is pretty good and picture is clear but my 3 year old fire is every bit as good and far more intuitive.  I really can't figure out what is supposed to be better about Echo Show.  It puts videos in my queue that I will never watch and it can't find the things I ask for.  Hate it so far.
 After reading the reviews of the first gen Echo Show, I opted to wait. I now have gen 2 and I love it! I haven't had a chance to try video calls yet, but I've used lots of other stuff, including the basic Alexa stuff like shopping list, reminders and alarms, playing music, playing audio books and even music videos and Hulu! So far, I love it! I'm really glad I opted for the adjustable stand (at an additional cost). The only thing I wish I had so far is a physical volume up/down button. Sometimes you just want to tap the volume up or down quickly, but I don't think it has that. Otherwise, I super love it and I plan to get one for my Mom, too!<br/><br/>Ps: there are volume buttons on top!
 Take this with a grain of salt since I didn't spend any time to train .  But appliance was not user friendly.  It does manage turning lights, fans on/off IF speak the connected utility ID clear enough for it to do it, otherwise get which one? And you have to repeat until it passes your pronunciation. You can't casually direct requests.  In games it will only except the EXACT answer'vemg. If answer is New York City it may not accept it (wrong-answer is New York CITY), etc.  Interface is not as smooth as I thought it would be.  But again, I did not delve into perfecting my procedure, and just yell at it.  Cats are more perceptive, intelligent and adaptive.
 I bought this to replace my original 1st generation Echo in my kitchen. Honestly I had no idea it was touchscreen until I turned it on the first time, as i couldnt find any info in the description. I was very happy that it is.  The main reason I wanted this was to use with the Wyze Cubes for a cheap security camera system and this works perfectly for that.  The sound quality is also amazing for its size and we love the easy accessibility to youtube and prime videos as well. My only complaints is that the youtube app is quite clunky and a but difficult to use, and theres no netflix on it yet. If they add netflix and fix the youtube app this would be 6 stars
 I'm pretty under impressed. I bought this to watch  instructional youtube videos and watch shows/movies in my kitchen while I'm cooking. Thought it would be easy especially with Alexa. However you have to go to Firefox and type in the youtube website then the video. Usually that wouldn't be a big deal to me but when I'm in the kitchen my hands are usually dirty or wet. When I saw it didn't allow Netflix, I wasn't sure but talked myself into it for the voice control and being able to stream HBO.  However, I can't watch HBO because I didn't purchase it through Amazon. I have cable and can access the app. If everything you have is Amazon, you will like this product but if you purchase entertainment from other companies like Netflix, Google, or HBO, you need to know this product does not support them.
 Bought this with great excitement to be able to play prime movies while in the kitchen. Sadly this Alexa is very hard of hearing. Some commands went unnoticed. The worst was trying to get it to play Prime Movies. That's right Amazon's device could not play movies from it's own streaming service without us wanting to pull our hair out. Most of the time she ignored play commands, other times the movies would just never start even though she showed the movie, and said she would play it. 1 star is to generous.
 Love it !!! Came 7 days early the sound is amazing only frustrating thing is I have Spotify not amazon music and if I use one Alexa device to play Spotify and can not then play on another device
 The new LARGER screen is fantastic and I think her sound is even better...I’m rocking out right now while typing my review ;) the only thing I don’t like is I purchased the 1st echo show version so I kinda duped myself- which don’t get me wrong she’s great too but not FANTASTIC.  I would compare this to going from Miranda Kerr to Gisele- they’re both beautiful but only 1 of them has the IT factor. Of course beauty is within the eye of the beholder.  **FULL DISCLOSURE- I am a complete and utter Alexa/Echo Junkie AND I have no intentions of seeking help.** ......I’ve gotta go Swagger Lee just came on and I have no choice but to bust a move....Alexa you vixen.
 Absolutely love my 2nd gen Echo Show.  Used the Amazon trade-in program (with my 1st gen Echo Show), which worked exceptionally well.  As for the new one, I have it in my kitchen on the breakfast bar.  And yes, with speakers in the back, it does need an open area so sound isn't muffled - no big deal IMHO. The screen size, sound, and color are superb.  It certainly dims well at night, so believe it would work fine in a bedroom.  Although some folks have entered negative comments about the various banners that come across the screen, I love them - they give me ideas about how to better use my Echo Show, as well as catching headlines and trending topics that I'd never think to ask about.  As a Prime member, I can easily stream music from Amazon.  Also, yes, the Echo Show can stream SiriusXM, which I have.  All you need is to pay for Internet streaming from SiriusXM and enable the skill for Alexa.  Works great (although you won't see any info about the song or artist, which does show up on regular SiriusXM device screens).  I use my Echo Show not only for music but to search for recipes, get the news and weather, change channels on DirectTV, call friends and family that also have Alexa devices, etc.  Very versatile!  Glad I upgraded!
 You likely won't be able to do what you want as everything pushes you to paid subscriptions that you likely dont already have. Like to use Spotify? Good luck getting to what you want and where you want...but pay for Amazon Music and options open. Use Netflix? Not on this device. Hulu will work better (which nobody uses btw).<br/><br/>Most frustrating is that everything is done by voice. This big beautiful screen has no way to touch your way to your music or videos.<br/><br/>For me, Google's device or a simple tablet would do so much more. Especially since I already have Smartthings hub.
 Owning a Echo show 1, Echo Spot, Echo plus , dot etc etc , I was on the waiting list for the all new Echo Show. Having now got it, i must admit that its a must have at every home. Compared to the Show 1, the screen size is a big improvement while HD quality display makes watching the Show 2 a pleasing experience.<br/>The sound quality is far improved with an in-depth Base sound on the new Echo show. The touch panel is also more sensitive and responds to even a slight nudge.<br/>I received the Echo Show 2 with a one months Hulu Subscription. Now that's what i call music! This Echo Show plays all our favourite Live TV channels (CNN, Fox, Cozy, Boomerang for kids .......) available on Hulu. This is indeed a new chapter in Television entertainment. In addition, Echo Show now has apps that can also play back some free to air Live News and entertainment channels.<br/>I have so far no negative feedback on the product. I did however noticed that once connected to a Bluetooth speaker (in my case to a Yamaha bluetooth), there was a little lagging in the sound track. This is not the case with Echo Show 1. Maybe at the next software update, Amazon can fix this minor concern.<br/>As always, A great product from Amazon. Try it Guys - it's sure worth the price!
 Absolutely LOVE my Echo show!!!! I’ve wanted to get one for over a year, the clunky look of gen 1 stopped me from buying it at the time, and I had 2 of the tallest 2nd gen Alexa speakers already. I didn’t think I could get a better sound than I already had.<br/>I have my show on one side of the kitchen and my speaker on the other side and the sound in my kitchen is AMMMMMAAAAAAZZZIIIINNNNGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!  It’s juat a tic or two below the sound of a Bose stereo at a wayyy more reasonable price!<br/>I have a lot to learn about all the things the echo  and the echo show can do, but I’m going to have a great time learning about it. Music is at the top of my reasons for having them. Without music this world would be a very dreary type of hell. I have music playing almost constantly 👍😁<br/>Right now I have a screensaver of a crackling fire going. White noise can be very relaxing.
 Theirs people that can't never be happy no matter what! I was really reluctant to buying amazon products like the alexa smart speaker, and echo show because I didn't like the idea of some one or something listening to what I say at all times but I can honestly say I was wrong. I just got my echo show and smart speaker yesterday and I'm already in shock of how awesome these products are simple to set up and use and the quality of the sound amazes me my echo show is as loud as my 55'in LG 4K TV its an amazing smart little screen that does the job I can now clean ,cook and have dinner while watching my favorite shows without having to touch or press anything. Just with my voice I'm able to jump directly to whatever interest me. I personally hate when people read the description of a product then go online after buying it just to complain about something they knew the product didn't have or couldn't do like Oh I purchase my echo show and I thought it was bigger then my 32"in tv but its not so I'm gonna give it 3 stars ...........
 I do love this item. We have had the Original Echo with Alexa for 5 years. I cannot be without Alexa!! We have always used as a timer, shopping list, Pandora, prime music, sleep sounds, and various other skills. I like the Show, but I had higher expectations. We are going to use it with the Ring Doorbell system and to video call relatives, but so far I have used it for recipes while cooking and prime video. So my problem is while using a recipe, I also wanted to set a timer. Once it goes to the timer, you can't tell her to resume the recipe, you have to ask her to find the recipe again and start over. I was also watching/listening to a movie and had the same issue. She won't just go back to where it left off. I had to ask for the movie again from scratch. But it did pick up where it left off once I got it back up. "Third world problems"! Overall, I'm glad I got it and cannot wait to find out what else it can do and see how it gets smarter over time, like the Echo.
 It’s a decent product. We also have the Google Home.  The Alexa has an amazing sound speaker, but be aware that you cannot play multiple songs on multiple devices without a $15 a month charge. This is very frustrating. I have a family of six, each person owning a dot and we have the show. The kids all want to set their own alarms and reminders and it is quite frustrating. This technology Seems like it is in its infancy, unfortunately.  Alexa get stumped very easily on questions, and you have to have just the right wording. However she does search for recipes and you can scroll through them and pick the one you want. That is helpful in the kitchen. It does have a large selection of music on Amazon music, however to get an unlimited amount, again, you have to pay for it. This is why we got the Google home as well, So we can get what we need without the hassle of trying to re-word every question we ask Alexa. That being said, the Google Home and the minis do not have good sound systems. They are decent, but Alexa blows them out of the water with her sound system.
 I'm satisfied with my purchase. It does what it's claimed to do. I bought it as an upgrade to the Aamazon Dot I got a year ago. The crystal clear sceen is excellent - very sharp colors for any picture or video you might play. I'm not that into music, although I do you it occasionally for that. I mostly enjoy watching YouTube Videos on it.<br/><br/>In regards to YouTube access, you just ask Alexa "Open Silk" to open its browser, and use the touch screen to open YouTube. I found it easy to use. It's cumbersome typing in the specific video you want, so it's best to touch the microphone icon and simply speak the name of the video. Once videos appear, you can use the screen to scroll to the one you want.<br/><br/>I only have a couple minor complaints: The screen is always on unless you tell Alexa "Screen Off". But if you happen to bump the screen with your hand or arm, it comes back on. There is no "off" button. You can use the Do Not Disturb feature to have the screen be off at specific times, but again, if you accidently touch the screen again, it comes on.<br/><br/>Secondly, the reviews rave about the sound quality. But I've found that the bass seems to be pretty strong, resulting in a sort of a muffled sound when Alexa responds to a question. You have to adjust the volume in those cases where the voice isn't super clear. The voice on the Echo Dot is clearer at times in comparison. At least that's my opinion. Others may disagree.<br/><br/>Overall, I really like this product. It's screen is big, but the unit isn't much bigger than the screeen so it doesn't take up a lot of space on a counter or table. I don't use the Echo Show every day, but I'm still glad I spent the money on it.
 I took advantage of the super sale and bought the new Echo Show 2nd gen.  So far I am not happy with it.  First the screen always looks dark even though I set the brightness to high and turned off the adjust with ambient light.  On my original Show the screen would automatically go to sleep after several minutes.  If the 2nd gen has that setting I cannot find it.  The best I can find is to tell it to turn the screen off.  Why not a setting for sleep with several time options.  Last, my original show came with a very nice screen saver set of beautiful pictures from around the world.  The 2nd gen comes with a slide show of pastel water color type drawings or a blank gray screen.  There is an option to upload and create your own slideshow.  Why not at least give us the same as the 1st gen with additional options.
 This new Echo Show was so easy to setup.  I wasnt sure about the split keyboard layout at first, but it is actually really comfortable to use when needed.  I do wish the browser would load a bit faster, both Firefox &amp; Silk a bit slow to open and load a web page.
 Edit 1/11/2018. I stick with my 2-star rating but this is relative to the 10" Fire tablet and price. The Show 2 is not bad and I get it that there are niche uses.  Unfortunately, those niches are not for me. IMHO the Show should run Android and not this experimental and buggy funny interface. Even if I liked this funny interface, it is also available on the tablet. I like an Echo Dot with a screen (=Echo Spot). Amongst others I can travel with it and easily change the WiFi. Can I travel with the Show? Possibly but ...<br/><br/>It does, what it does and it is not bad except that the current software has issues. I cannot play Prime movies. Sound is worse than my $50 bluetooth soundbar. Screen is just 720p. Why, please why does this thing even exist? I mean, for that price Amazon could have taken the 10" Amazon Fire tablet hardware and pug into the speakers of the Show. And please: what is Amazon thinking? Another proprietary power plug? How about USB C?<br/><br/>No, the Show is not bad. It just misses the point (for me).
 Very nice, this is my third one, love them, grandson approved also for his bedroom, he can play his own music and watch different programs on it, great sound too, family loves them, great for security also just ask Alexa show me the front door, and there it is. You can even check on your house when gone, on your phone, ask her to show you your echo and you can talk or look to see what is going on in house...Cool!
 I have had this for about a month now. Sound is very good and overall a great product. I had been using an echo which I liked but was going to purchase an echo plus but decided to get a Show, Spot, and fire tab 8 with Alexa. My biggest complaint is you truly cant get the display to show what you want. With some effort you can get close but ultimately you get messages that say Try"Alexa …. Playing movies and such is also not convenient. I have several fire sticks and they work great and way easier then the Show. Another issue is if you start adding hi Res cameras you better have a very good internet connection. I run dual band DSL and upload speed seems to get in the way with a few devices running. With a few software changes it could be a great product, the hardware is overall very good. My spot and show went back. I kept the tab but still fighting with show mode when I put it on the wireless dock (show dock). I may end up abandoning the dock and simply use it without show mode.  Going back to echo, a very nice product
 Great improvement over gen 1 echo show. Larger screen makes it  easier to see things like time and temperature. Sound is amazingly clear with improved bass response. Don’t really like “booming” bass sound while listening to rock music so I had to turn bass down using equalizer. Besides music, we use it for timers, reminders, weather reports, phone calls, recipes, jokes and various skills. What a great “toy” as well as useful device! Only wish Amazon would update software to allow us to adjust font size of time/temperature &amp; include day/date on home display along with the time/temperature.
 I bought the Echo Show two-pack at a great price because I had recently purchased Ring doorbells for our house and our parents home. We wanted to be able to see who was at the door in either location before having to go answer the door because stairs in a split-level home are becoming more of a problem as they age.<br/><br/>I also wanted our parents to be able to see who was at the door without having to worry about constantly carrying a phone or finding it every time the doorbell rang. The Echo Show  just sits on the table near where they sit most of the time and a simple voice command can let them see and talk to whoever is there.<br/><br/>Although it kinda seems like 'spying,' it also gives us peace of mind to know that when our daughter is supposed to pick up Grandpa at 1:00p for his doctor appointment, she actually shows up on time. We have video evidence of the comings and goings at our parent's home.  And if she doesn't show, guess who is getting an emergency 'get your butt over there now'  call!<br/><br/>I work from home, so I placed the second unit in my upstairs office so I can do the same thing... see who it is and determine whether I have to drop everything to answer the door.  If a signature is required on a package, the carrier at least knows someone is on the way down, and I don't have to go to the post office to pick up 'missed deliveries.' This alone made it worth the cost of the Show in time saved going to the post office 2-3 times a month.<br/><br/>As an added benefit, my father-in-law likes to follow the markets, and Alexa can intermittently and automatically show him any stocks or market conditions he's interested in.<br/><br/>Echo Show makes caring for elderly parents so much easier and relieves a lot of worry about 'not knowing'.  We use the DROP IN feature to check in with them occasionally.  They do the same with us if they need anything. Any of the Echo/Alexa setups can do the same thing, but sometimes there is no substitute for being able to see the other person.<br/><br/>And finally, as one of many other added benefits, with Alexa no question goes unanswered, and with Amazon Music there isn't a song they can remember that they can't hear again on a moment's notice.  They often wonder who an actress is on an old movie and as long as you know the name of the movie you can get a list of cast members for pretty much anything.  And last Christmas we were over there and heard coming from the other room, "Alexa, play Burl Ives Christmas music." (Now there's something you don't hear every day....)  But by golly, Burl Ives Christmas music came up with lyrics, and the room was filled with "Holly Jolly Christmas" and a lot of other great old songs I'd never heard.  It made them very happy.
 The Echo Show is a great device nearly ruined by a poor software decision by Amazon.<br/><br/>The device sounds great, is easy to set up, and is dead simple for home automation purposes.  However, the bottom of the screen is interrupted by a constant advertisement from Amazon to try various Echo skills. This cannot be shut off.  It's always there ruining the screen.  It nearly caused me to dump the Echo ecosystem entirely and switch to Google (I still may...).<br/><br/>If the constant advertisement doesn't bother you,  consider this a 4/4.5 star review.  I, however,  believe I should be able to control all of the screen real estate and should be able to shut off things I don't like.
 I bought this specifically for the video capabilities. I bought 3 so my kids and parents have them and we can video with granddaughter.<br/><br/>It is easy to use for things like turning on movies, music, video conferencing, viewing security cameras, and video conferencing.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, I cannot even fathom the reasoning behind not having even a short term battery. It comes with a six foot cord which won't even get you out of the room you're in.  My plan was to be able to keep it in my office and take to kitchen when needed.  I cannot do that without unplugging, replugging and waiting for it to set up.  The only reason I can come up with for no battery is Amazon doesn't want you to be able to take it room to room but wants you to purchase additional shows for each room you would need it in.  I find that frustrating...and a little infuriating. I am currently looking into whether a longer power cord can be purchased and will update when I find out.
 Now days , people are not even satisfied with 1080P and looking for 2k , 4k or 8k .  This device is not even 1080P and the pictures are kind of  dark most of the time even on the brightest mode.  the touch screen is also very weak , most of the time won't work, very difficult  to get You Tube, no app store, and .....  You cant even change the picture on your albums with the touch  and most of the time stock in one picture . Amazon need to reprogram  this device and for sure the new one should should have at least a full  HD 1080P.  I give it two star because of the sound quality only.
 I've been using this echo for a few weeks now, and I love the screen and sound. However, it's buggy. It would start making scratchy noises for no reason, and all of a sudden it doesn't play any sound. I have to unplug, wait a few minutes, and then plug it back in to get it working again. It happens from time to time, and it IS annoying. Also, I often have a problem controlling music using the touchscreen.
 Decided to rewrite my review, I adjusted the screen brightness and the EQ for better sound
 The all new look and feel of the newest Echo Show (2nd/generation) along with its awesome speakers and screen clarity is amazing!  I can’t wait to purchase several more for my guest bedrooms. Thank you, Amazon for an AWESOME product!
 I'm currently using both Echo Show and Google Home Hub/Lenovo Display. This one is very closed to perfect, but I'm ignoring youtube in this review since that have nothing to do with the actual product itself. It would be great if the home screen can rotate some photo/image of the day like the Google Home Hub can, it actually nicer to look at and not repetitive since it cycle differently every day. The Echo show just have some simple repeated artworks and cycle trending news, it gets old very quick. Unless you create your own album to let it cycle. Controlling lights is a bit unorganized when you have a large amount of smart lights in the house. The Google Home Hub have much better organization when it comes to linked smart home products. Though the 10.1" screen amazing, really great for kitchen use. Sound is MUCH better than other smart display, bass and sound are just really good for what it is. Amazon could really use some features from the Google home hub to improve the Echo, it's REALLY close to being the best in the market.
 I really like this device it resides in my Kitchen The Alexa functionality is good and getting better all the time. Sound and screen size is pleasing but like the rest of the device, it could use improvements. My two main complaints are #1 the is lack of multiple users control and #2 tablet type functionality.  If you want to make a call you can only pull from one address book which is cumbersome for a device meant to serve a home as a centralized device. The device is limited to the echo show mode and Aleza only and has no tablet-style functionality like adding your favorite apps which is limiting at best and a gross omission at the very least. I do hope the platform improves overall. Look at it this way if I want to add a new Hue or smart thing device I have to pick up my Fire HD 10 or phone or laptop to add it so Alexa can control it because the Echo Show is useless in this regard. Not what I expected and I'm sure very frustrating for many less tech-savvy DIYers.
 I have dots, and the original echo and the first Echo show.  I love the larger screen and the sound is awesome also.  I highly recommend.  I am so impressed with Amazon service.  I was actual able to see where the delivery truck was, and a approximate time when my package would arrive.  They also took a picture of my porch where they left it.  I am impressed.
 I think the Echo Show was inaccurately described on Amazon's page.  It does everything that the page says.  What the page doesn't say is that the ES doesn't run a web browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.).  You can't run common programs like Thunderbird or Gmail email programs.  It doesn't stream from Netflix.<br/>What this really reminds me of is a smartphone in a larger box plus wireless bluetooth speakers.  If you want to control everything in your house with Zigbee devices do Skype-like video phone calls it will do that.  It has many links to content providers, many of which will charge you extra for their service.<br/>If this is what you want, the ES will probably satisfy you.  If you want more as mentioned above, you need a laptop or all-in-one computer, which, granted, is quite a bit more expensive.<br/>Not recommended except for its specific functions.
 Great screen, awesome sound, easy to set up, nice touch screen, etc... great over all, but needs to be able to do more than just amazon video. Just about any device you get now a days, even the other amazon devices can do netflix, why not this? Also, you cant pair other speakers to this, you can just pair your phone or another echo to it. I have external speakers with a bluetooth amp that run my outside speakers, I cant pair it to another set of speakers. The bluetooth is only one way, to this... fix these few things, and it is great!
 This version has a Bigger screen and for me that's really a plus because since I hit that 40 year old age limit my eyesight has just not been the same. The new Speaker system  sounds great at any volume especially when its being played loud, and I like it loud. This unit also has a lot of new tweeks and hidden features that the older smaller version did not have.
 Perhaps you would like to watch videos on this device. Amazon Prime, YouTube, Hulu?<br/>After a few minutes the screen times out and returns to the home screen.<br/>The device cannot resume where you left off. You must go through the entire video location procedure and start over.<br/>Quite disappointing. No way to change time out.<br/>Also times out for Amazon Prime Music screen and returns to home screen. If you touch the screen, it will return to the music screen, but will time out again.<br/>As others have pointed out, the home screen always has "Alexa try..." or "Alexa show me the best selling...( fill in random Amazon product here). No way to shut this off.<br/>Over all it is merely ok. Lots and lots of room for improvement.<br/>Mostly underdeveloped technological possibilities and therefore<br/>annoying.
 I've had an Echo Spot for a long while but wanted a larger screen. While the spot is PERFECT for a desk, or a nightstand, the Echo Show is great for entertainment (however my Echo Show is right next to my bed ass well...lol). I LOVE this. Bright screen, lots of color, and easy to use. You can  completely turn off the screen by voice if it's next to your bed, or set it to dim really really low. On the lowest auto brightness setting this gets dark enough for me to sleep without disturbing me.<br/><br/>The sound is the best of any device I have so far. It also comes with Silk and Firefox for browsing, enabling you to do just about everything from it!<br/><br/>Paired great with my bluetooth mouse &amp; keyboard. Convenient for twitter, FB, and other sites. Also paired quickly to my phone, earbuds and external speakers.
 Ive used the 1st gen Show as a background media device for about a year and my only real complaint was the screen size for watching shows. In that time we have lost then gained youtube access, and gained Tidal and Hulu support, This device is wonderful as it s basically a tablet in a speaker enclosure so you get a full screen experience at the expense of front directed audio. Since I still feel they are targeting the this for a corner of your kitchen all of the sound is now reflected from the back and while it is much more "spacious" and "immersive", its not nearly as clear as front fired speakers, this is true with TVs, phones, tablets, laptops etc so its not a device specific behavior. This gen also has a built in Zigbee hub so you can use things like Hue bulbs without having to buy the additional hub. If you can grab one at a discount, its definitely worth a try.
 got this for my wife, wanted something to cook with in the kitchen, sounded like you just say a recipe and alexa pulls it up for you to use... blah way more trouble than its worth.. lots of inbetween stuff needs to be done to just get a simple recipe to show.. she winds up using her phone to get the recipe she needs.
 So I had high hopes for the echo show, and have been met with frustration on many levels on many occasions. First, if you’re not VERY specific, you’ll probably get “hmmm, I don’t know that”. So then you’ll go through a dozen different ways of saying the same thing, before it will finally “get” it. It’s not intuitive at all. It should have come with a manual stating exactly how you have to say something in order to get it to work. Try adding multiple lights in the same room to a group so you can turn them all on or off at once. Do it perfectly the first time, or you’ll find yourself telling it a dozen times what you want, only to have it repeat the wrong thing back to you. Over. And over. And over. Amazon needs to hire someone to program these things that actually understands how to account for the multitude of ways people may want to program it to accomplish the tasks they want, without coming up with a “hmmmm, I don’t know that”.
 Free light bulb, doesn't work. Oh well, it was free after all. Logitech Hub &amp; Harmony Elite remove have worked perfectly since we set them up 2 years ago. The instructions on the Alexa app say to down load the Harmony app, sync it to  the hub, then add to Alexa app. That's it. I download the Harmony app, it works with all the devices we have attached perfectly, I sync it to the Alexa app, no errors, Alexa doesn't recognize any of the Activities that are in the Harmony App, not a single one. I don't know where to begin to trouble shoot this mess and I can't find anyone to call to help.<br/>So far the only things connected to Alexa are 1 plug and 1 light bulb.<br/>Also, if I had know I'd have to download an app for everything and connect the apps I would have re-thought the whole thing. What happens if I leave the house with my phone and mu husband wants to turn a light off? Is Alexa taking his command, using my phone data plan to  send it to the Alexa app on my phone, have Alexa on my phone connect to the app that actually controls the light and sending the proper response back to Alexa in my house to turn off the light?? do I have to load all the apps I loaded on my phone on his phone too??<br/>And again, where do I go to get answers to my questions? The help is helpless, the search engine doesn't understand complicated questions and there's no on to call.
 I was super excited to receive my Echo Show but quickly realized that it wasn't exactly what i was expecting. The screen quality is excellent and the sound is fantastic. While i love how the image quality looks and how the sound performs, it does have a few flaws.<br/><br/>There is no main screen where all of your apps will live, You will need to ask the Echo to open things up. For some reason when ever i ask to open spotify it asks me to set up a video provider on the alexa app.<br/><br/>The Hulu app is limited in what you can search or watch and its the same thing for prime video. It is almost impossible to get the echo show to open up the correct show when you ask her to. I have found i have to ask the echo to open something and then look for it manually.<br/><br/>It is pretty bulky and takes up a bit of space .<br/><br/>The alexa app itself is a little hard to figure out and has made me use a google home to control my home devices.<br/><br/>All in all its a good speaker and great for video chatting ( Once you can figure it out), but there are still a lot of things that are lacking that Amazon could improve.
 Just have been using for a week but while trying to set it up I could not adjust the size of the clock fonts and could not get rid of the Alexa tips. discovered these are common complaints. Because it is an item that is always on it is very annoying. While researching the show it sounded like a wonderful household companion that would fulfill my every need. After receiving it all I hear is I don't do that or I don't know that you are saying while all the time scrolling things to try. (my attempt at humor) Seriously I have set it up with the smart plug and the security camera and enjoy listening to classical music. I do hope they find a way to get rid of the Alexa tips and ways to adjust the clock size as not everyone has young eyes. After Christmas will set up a calendar etc..
 Returning it because of the constant "Things to Try" notifications on the home screen. I contacted Cust. Service and there's no way to turn that off. Also, it's lousy at playing anything online, like a video on YouTube. The voice and image do not sync up. Not happy with this device, it's going back tomorrow.
 Amazon really got it right with this second gen Echo Show. It does so many useful things for me. I use it to ask questions, activate Alexa compatible devices, play Spotify, etc. However, it also makes a great speaker phone since you can link a mobile phone number and have it make calls. Very useful since I work from home sometimes. It also has a browser (2 actually), so you can get to things like YouTube with a couple steps. It gets plenty loud if you want it to. Alexa is getting better at answering questions asked with natural language, but there are still times when I feel like I have to memorize a specific way to ask for certain functions. Bottom line, though, is that Alexa with a screen is a nice plus. I traded in a regular Echo to upgrade to this and I use it a lot more.
 I own three 1st Gen Echo Shows... and just purchased my first 2nd Gen Show. Very nice product, a definite upgrade. Overall I am pleased with it, except for the hints on the home screen.<br/><br/>Let the user decide if we want hints displayed on the bottom of the screen. I don't. Give us an option to turn hints off.<br/><br/>I would give this product a 5-star rating if this one major annoyance was remedied. The home screen should allow some customization by the end user. Please fix this issue, which is long overdue.
 Haven’t explored everything about the Show yet but loving it already. The sound quality is just amazing compared to our old 1st gen echo. I’m loving the feature that allows “dropping in” on other rooms of the house by using multiple echo devices. We will be getting a dot or spot for every room to create a cool whole house intercom system(though that’s less a review of the Show as it is of Echo devices in general.) Our Show is on the kitchen island so it will be handy for recipes as well!
 Where do I begin<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- My thermostat, door bell, light bulbs and outlets are compatible with the Amazon show<br/>- Good size screen<br/>- Great for recipes<br/>- News articles are an okay bonus<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- You can't search the internet<br/>- video quality for video chats are not good<br/>- you can only watch tv on PRIME and all the good shows COST ADDITIONAL MONEY - this is the big reason I am only giving this a 2 star review and consider that lucky<br/>-Netflix and Hulu are NOT compatible<br/>- You cannot search the internet<br/>- you can play music from Pandora but you CANNOT click on the channel you want<br/><br/>Summary,<br/>Spend a bit more and Buy an old IPad or anything similar.  you'll have access to a LOT more things!
 Just terrible. The Echo Show is so limited. Could be great in a few years but I’m not willing to wait because it’s TERRIBLE RIGHT NOW. Let’s start with what it CANNOT do.<br/>Can’t play: YouTube or Netflix.<br/>Doesn’t search: you can ask it questions but it won’t know 90% of them AND it won’t search it on bing. So the ad that Amazon shows saying “Alexa show me a recipe” is FALSE. You can’t manually type in searches either.<br/><br/>Partial capabilities: Searching, some apps let you search. Let’s start with Hulu. You can bring up Hulu but won’t have the option from the home screen to search on Hulu. You’ll have to find the right verbal request that’ll allow you to drag the endless screen for what you want. Example: I wanted to watch the current season of South Park.<br/>Me: “Alexa play South Park season 22 episode 1.”<br/>Alexa: “here is South Park season 1 episode 1.”<br/>This happened every time! I had to have it bring up the South Park page then scroll to the episode I wanted. 22 seasons of scrolling took so long!<br/>Let’s talk about the touch screen! THE NON RESPONSIVE TOUCH SCREEN! I practically had to punch the thing to get it to react to my haptics. Am I supposed to double PUSH to get a video to play? Or pause? Don’t even try to drag the progress bar to rewind advance an episode or song, just accept your fate and play from where you’re at or start over.<br/>I can complain about so many more first world problems here, but it’s not worth my time or yours. Pass on this and get a tablet.
 Wow! Deciding between Echo Show and Google Home is tough because most reviewers don’t own either. I finally decided on Echo Show because it controls more things, allows video chats, has a bigger screen, and gives me extras at no cost because of my Prime Membership (like Amazon Music).<br/><br/>Be aware that you need to decide which control convention to go with (Z-wave or Zigbee). I chose Zigbee because the switches and plugs that use Zigbee seemed to be a little cheaper than Z-wave devices. That means Echo’s higher cost can be offset by cheaper accessories. As you add more items, the difference adds up.<br/><br/>WiFi controlled devices will work with either Echo or Google but could begin to slow down your Internet due to traffic jams in your router. Z-wave and Zigbee apparently don’t go through the router.<br/><br/>Also be aware of the feud between Amazon and Google is kind of like between Sony’s Beta Max VCR and the VHS format. One will win and half of us will be left with outdated technology.<br/><br/>Smart ahome setup is beyond the capabilities of most home owners and you may need the help of a Tech Guru at additional cost. But if you just want to plug it in and surf while you cook, it’s not too hard to do.<br/><br/>Being able to check who’s at the front door, see when packages arrive, remotely control lights, are all easier for those with limited mobility, but they still need enough tech smarts to be able to make it work. Probably not a good option for a Grandparrent who doesn’t know how to use their smart phone.
 I am happier with the new 2nd Gen Echo Show. Bigger screen, better sound, but the screen has very limited use. No YouTube, StreamPlayer is losing content with much less live channels than a few months ago. If you are happy with Amazon Video for your watching pleasure, I guess it is OK. A friend of mine has a Google Display and that thing has lot's to watch. Better watch out Amazon, Google has already caught up. You will be playing catch up if you don't start getting more video choices here soon. If you don't, I may have to abandon Amazon for Google. By the way, I had two 1st Gen Show and opne broke, The second one is starting to act up. Hope it is not going bad too. If so, this will be a reason for me to make th jump. They don't last more than a year.
 Alexa is like another member of the family and the Show takes it a step further with interactive video.  We now have multiple Alexa devices in our home and can't fathom how we ever got along without her. Just be careful saying her name in casual conversation...she will butt in.
 This should have been the first generation! This has all the bells and whistles that I was hoping for with the first generation. I’m just very happy it’s finally here and I’m able to enjoy it completely.
 I love the Show. The sound is great and does not require connecting additional speakers (unless you are really picky about sound settings). We have 3 Alexa devices in our home and use all of them. I especially like being able to see the display of the words to the songs while playing music on the Show. I listen to music on all my devices but connect additional speakers to the Dot in order to use it on the deck during warmer weather. I have no complaints about any of the devices but like the Show the best. It (as well as the Echo and Dot) was very easy to setup and use. I purchased the sandstone color simply because I like the lighter shade but I'm sure the black looks just as good. It's merely an aesthetic choice.
 Love my echo show 2 .... needs a few tweaks tho .... like the ability to control the Alexa voice separately from music , news etc , controls my hue lights and links flawlessly with my audible account so I’m not wasting space on my iphone or iPad ....drop in let’s me check up on my pets  ....
 I wanted this to replace the first one. I am not sure this is better.<br/><br/>The one thing I have found is better than the first ones, the music  is louder.<br/><br/>The screen is larger.  You  can use Firefox and play youtube.<br/><br/>The bad for me is my one young kitty goes nuts for sound, and the speakers in the back make her want to flip this over. Tv sounds are low, so adjusting the volume from music to tv is a slight pain.<br/><br/>I use mine to drop in on the cats while working. Most of the time they get busted doing naughty things.<br/><br/>Drop in and calling is very handy, when someone can't be with you, they can check on you.<br/><br/>I feel the first generation is better, but this will work.
 I have 5 echo dots and this is my 2nd echo show (the first being the 1st gen). This new one is extremely buggy! If I ask for sports update, I'm lucky for one of the team's logo to actually show up. There are numerous others, which I would express directly to Amazon, which leads me to my next major concern: There is zero option to provide feedback on what works and what doesn't. Unlike other products, there is seriously no effort on behalf of Amazon to report bugs in order to improve their product. It seems as all the focus is on selling as many as possible, with no focus on actually improving the product or taking feedback from customers/bug reports.<br/>This is the last 'Echo/Alexa' device I will ever purchase.
 I have Alexa’s in most of my rooms at home. This one is by far my favorite. The first thing you will notice, is the screen. It’s huge compared to the 1st gen. Second you will notice is the sound. Has a lot of bass compared to the first gen. Tweaking the equalizer a bit and this thing sounds great. Built in web browser is nice, and overall look of it is a major improvement over last gen. Whole home audio sounds good to. Waiting to get the Echo sub to pair with a couple of these things.
 This is the 2nd one I purchased of the 2nd generation echo show.  I purchased this one because the first one I bought stopped responding after 5 hrs.  This one did the same thing.  So, then I wanted to try and resolve the issue.  The support team didn’t have any answers since I had called them the first time.  So, I looked online for help.  One person said to turn on the Do Not Disturb under settings and this didn’t work.  Another person said to check the network.  So, the echo show was on an extended network (we have a repeater to get a better signal).  I took it off the extended network and put it on the main network and it works fine.  So, I still had the first one and did the same for that one and now it works fine.  Three days in and they are both responding every time.  Awesome!<br/><br/>Also, I had purchased a google home hub and it doesn’t work well with an iPhone.  It’s more difficult to set up and sync then Alexa.  I do like the fact that the google home hun read recipes step by step and pauses until you’re ready to continue.  But, ALEXA my favorite.
 Amazon did a good job in seeing what improvements should be made with the Show 1st gen.  Bigger screen is a huge plus.  Speaker sound quality is much better than the 1st gen.  I paired mine with the Alexa Sub woofer and have good all around sound, but not quite bose quality.<br/><br/>I tried bluetooth pairing with an AIWA speaker and the functionality was awkward.  It would play music through the AIWA at one point and no other sounds would play, such as Alexa responding.  When it finally connected with Alexa responding and music then I would get a thump out of the AIWA speaker every several seconds.  If you are looking for the sound quality as I was, I highly recommend considering the Alexa sub woofer.
 I love the new Echo Show (2nd Generation).  the screen is so much bigger and brighter. The sound quality is amazing. I watch movies on it, Stream the news, and have a fantastic photo slideshow on the background. It was so nice to stream Christmas songs and sing along to the lyrics on the screen. I am giving my 1st generation Echo Show to a friend out of state. It will be great to video chat with them. I also am able to view all of my security cameras on it. I can't say enough about it.  Great job Amazon!!  p.s. I did NOT receive one free from amazon to review. but would have loved it if they had. I not only bought myself one. I also bought 2 more to give to my parents and to my brother.
 I really enjoy the new show.  It has a nicer design than the original. The only DRAWBACK I have is that I have it in my bedroom on the nightstand right next to my bed, and even on its dimmest setting, the light is annoying.  I wish the screen could turn totally dark and I would have given it 5 stars.  There was no setup.  It came preconfigured for my account and wifi out the box. It also sounds great.  I am considering ordering a second to see how the subwoofer only option works.
 Alexa is full of information and we like the way her answers are typed in words to display on screen. That helps my Dad who is hard of hearing and can read her answers on screen. She also puts up the lyrics to the song we're playing. The reason we got the show is for our RING Video Doorbell. It works great and my Dad is having a good time with it all. He's 90 years old and stuck in his chair all the time. Alexa is his new best friend :-) We can drop in on all the other echo's we have throughout the house.
 This product is one of the most awesome devices that one can own.  The Echo Show has so many features that make them fun to use.  Everyone should have many Echo devices in their home.  They have so many skills and are extremely easy to use.  We have had many Echo products since they were introduced in 2015 and use them everyday.  Whether it be for Notifications, Important dates to remember, Communicating with friends and family members, News, Weather, Sports or just listening to your favorite music, nothing beats the Echo products.  You can also use them to control all types of smart devices throughout your home.  I would strongly recommend everyone to consider purchasing many Echo Products as soon as they can.
 I bought the Show 2nd. Gen to replace my old Echo Show.  This unit is much better than the first because of its screen.  The Bluetooth connectivity is little better than the first.  My first Echo Show keep disconnecting my Bluetooth speakers. The sound still needs more help.  For better sound, I still need to connect my speakers to it.  This 2nd. gen Show do have better voice recognition than the original.  I would give the 1st. generation Echo Show a D &amp; the second generation a C or 3 Stars.
 This device has a really nice screen and excellent sound. The display colors are good. It gives trivia like tidbits at the bottom when you are not interacting with it. It's smarter than the Fire Cube. Music sounds really nice, even when volume is turned up high. I couldn't tell if the music is stereo or not. The bass is surprisingly good. The only negative is the unit is kind of big and bulky. It takes up space on the counter.
 Had first gen and had to replace due to glitchy, twitching screen flicker. Not impressed with the process to “repair” (found out only after I reached out to amazon it can’t be repaired and at that time, unable to be returned). So I was leery of the second gen but it’s much more refined - bigger and better screen, definite improvement in sound quality. Picks up my voice an easy 25’ away and is good for background music (for our use). Just beginning to “drop in” with other devices at home and with Contacts — easy and beautiful screen with no lag in video conferencing. Would rate 5 stars but need to give it a few months — hopefully it’s more reliable and doesn’t fail!
 The new version of the Echo Show is a huge improvement. Much larger screen than before, better sound quality, and it also acts as a bridge to control lights and switches around the house. I liked my previous Show, but this new version is a huge upgrade.
 The speaker system is really great ... I love the sound.  I've ordered a stand and I'm hoping that will help with angling it for phone calls ... sometimes you have to pick it up to get the right angle, but that's not a huge issue. The reason we purchased the Show was for video calls with our son who lives out of state and that has been awesome!  The call quality (video and audio) is great.  My main problem is that it gets "stuck" while rotating through my photos in the background so I have to unplug it and then plug it back in. I'm not sure if this issue is the Show or my phone or our WiFi ... but, so far that's my biggest complaint. Overall I love the Show!
 The overall looks are great and the sound is wonderful. The larger screen is worth the money depending on how you use the device. We have two of original Echo Shows, one in my study and one in the bathroom. Both are fine the those rooms. We also have a Echo Show Dot which is used as a bedside clock and controller.<br/>All these devices work very well though sometimes we do have to reboot our modem/router when they lose connectivity.
 I'm an Alexa skill developer and looked forward to incorporating Echo Show into several business apps requiring visual information. My Show sits on my dev computer desk and I'm constantly tell it to "Alexa, blank the screen" This is a serious pain in the ass. I'm on the verge of returning it. In addition, when you're playing music, some songs show a constantly moving lyric display, I hate this. What's next the bouncing ball?  Just about every screen shows tips, shown here, "Alexa, what's on my to-do list?"  Disabling these tips, lyrics or an absolutely black idle screen are not configurable.<br/><br/>To summarize, I have 8 Echo Dots used for IoT voice integration projects. So I want this Show to be another development tool. The audio is great, however the non-skill screens are a constant irritation. Does Amazon sell Echo Show hoods?
 The sound is great but I don't understand why I would pay for Prime Music, which doesn't have music videos, instead of just using Bluetooth to play YouTube music or anything else.<br/><br/> It is more of a speaker, an awesome speaker, that was given the ability to search the web as an afterthought.<br/><br/> If It could cast audio/video from my phone to the device then I would give it 5 starts, but since it is just another Amazon consumption device I can only give it 3 stars.
 I have some type of echo device in "almost" every room in my house.  Went up to the spot for my desk and kitchen so I could make video calls to relatives (and they were on sale at the time!!).  When the Show went on sale, bought that to upgrade from the spot.  The show gives a beautiful picture, even with my video doorbell.  The countdown timer in the kitchen unit even shows time remaining.  The sound quality is very good as we are playing holiday songs now.  My only disappointment is that I want tv on it and Hulu monthly price is out of line since I already have cable.  GET the optional STAND.  Almost a must for most placements.
 Not a computer savvy kind of person and instructions could have done a better job of walking you through it, rather than having to go to multiple web links. But even I got it working in about an hour. Suggest not doing while kids are watching you waiting for it to work - downloads take some time. Once working, it is really great. Fantastic sound quality and great voice recognition. Already doing things with it I never expected I would bother with
 Screen size is perfect, I got the first gen show as a present. Which got the family hooked, we had an echo previously, but the Show opens up so many use cases. My son loves to see the lyrics as he listens to songs he's never heard, like the Beatle's Blackbird. We play games, see the the weather for the week ahead, have our photos scrolling through, see upcoming tasks, see news items we've missed or weird things to know. The list goes on. Home Hubs have been available for over a decade, but the Amazon Show 2nd Gen, makes them a reality. I use the first gen show on my desk, with is the ideal viewing angle.
 This is my second echo show. It was DOA. Returned. Scared to even use Amazon products after this....
 First impression is it a quality device but still getting to know it. One observation is it takes a very long time to open camera views in the Blink skill and there is a serious lack of live video skills...hope there’s more coming. Seems like it should be easy enough have access to Playstation Vue or other.
 This thing is awesome.  I love being able to watch Hulu in the kitchen w/o bothering my husband while he naps on the couch in the living room!  The apps (like SideChef) are great for cooking... picture by picture instructions so mistakes are a thing of the past.  The music sounds AMAZING!!!  The bass is outstanding and really fills a small/medium sized room very well.  The Echo Show (2nd gen) is seriously worth every penny!!!!!
 I thought at first I'd made a mistake. I bought 5 of these 1 for each of our homes and 3 for our children to have in their homes. I wanted to be able to keep up with the grandbabies and I thought this way they could call me on Alexa and not bother with Momma. LOL. Well I couldn't figure out how to hook ours up so they worked on different phone numbers on my acct. If you have one of these and haven't figured out just what they can do, spend a few minutes with one of Amazon's wonderful Show experts! THEY ARE AMAZING! After I got off the phone I taught the young ones a few things. LOVE LOVE LOVE
 I have every the old Echo Show and this new one. I def like the new one better as the screen size is awesome. It does sound better as well. The only flaw, which was also in the last generation is when you use the drop in function, or even picture function, the view is not great. It needs to till forward a bit. There are stands out there that will allow you to rotate or tilt, but not do both. I’m waiting for a stand that can do both. All &amp; all i’m Very very happy with the show!
 Don't buy it! Returned the first one because of issues with uploading contacts. Same thing with the second one. My daughter and a friend of her's has the same problem. We're all pretty tech savvy, It can't be all of us! On the plus side we now have a $225 radio in our kitchen ☹️
 Mu husband does not know how to power up a computer. He is not interested in technology tools. However, he loves the Amazon Show because it us always on and the voice recognition works. I created music playlists for each of us and he can now play his favorite music without my assistance. I love the ability to add items to my shopping list and add appointments to my calendar while washing dishes. My husbands To Do list is easily updated. When we play games like Jeopardy, you cssn read the questions and see the answers all at the same time. I'm hooked and love the convience of the Alexa products. We now have an Echo Show for the kitchen, an Echo Spot for the bedroom, an Echo 2nd gen for one of the bvathrooms and the garage. My kids are each getting an Echo Show for Christmas for their homes. Thanks Amazon for making these products affordable.
 After a month and a half the previous five star rating now falls to three with further falls likely.  A first the Echo Show worked perfectly and we could chat our granddaughter and great granddaughter live.  BUT, for the past week and a half it's either they can't see or hear us or I can see and hear them they can see me but they can't hear us.  "Support" (I used that term advisedly) is poor being limited to Google search results.  After doing a factory reset, which was supposed to leave the WiFi in place but didn't, we won't know if we can video chat until later today. We are disappointed.
 To me the software is so buggy seems like it was pushed out before testing was finished. Specifically:<br/>1. Do not disturb doesn't work. At first it refused to set the time. Then it would immediately go into that mode even outside the specified time period. The issue was discussed in various forums and couldn't find a solution yet.<br/>2. Photo slideshow doesn't work either. Uploaded my photos to prime photos and specified fast (2 seconds) for slideshow. The picture doesn't change for minutes! After waiting a while for it to finally changed a couple times, it stuck and stopped!<br/><br/>How can functionality so basic failed so miserably?<br/><br/>update 11/7/2018<br/>----------------------<br/>decided to revise my rating from 2 to 4 stars based on the following:<br/>1. received phone calls and email from Amazon customer service after just a few hours leaving the comment with offer to help. surprised by the speed and appreciate the sincere effort.<br/>2. after letting the device sat overnight, the 'do not disturb' feature started to work and the slideshow is behaving better (still slow, but at least work consistently).<br/><br/>i suspected the device came with old software and were updated constantly in the background. so you might want to let it sit for a while before exploring the features seriously.
 Received 2nd generation Echo Show as Christmas gift.  Was very excited about placing device in kitchen to watch YouTube.  Unfortunately, YouTube videos stop playing after 5 minutes and return to home page screen making it useless for this purpose.  Other web videos have trouble playing as well.  Video starts and after about 5 seconds starts over in endless loop.  I wouldn't recommend this product until they fix the video play problems.<br/><br/>Update #1 (1/4/19): Was contacted by Customer Service and was advised to unplug Echo Show for approximately 1 minute and then plug in again.  This action seemed to have fixed the problem as videos on YouTube and other Websites now play properly.  Therefore, I am revising my Overall Rating from a 1 to a 5.<br/><br/>Update #2 (1/5/19):  All problems came back when tried to play videos again.  In addition, screen became locked on video page with no way to exit.  Alexa commands didn't work.  Contacted customer service and Echo Show was factory reset.  Videos still didn't play properly.  Will probably try to return device.  Too bad.  Great idea for product, if it worked.  Revising review back to 1 star again.
 This was not something I thought I would want but for Christmas we received the show and two echo dots.  They were easy to set up ( We're senior citizens and not super tech savy) and we are having fun with them.  We have grandchildren that live out of state so it is great to talk to and see them everyday.  Alexa is a lot of fun.  We learn new things from her every day.  I've figured out how to have music play all over the house.  She is great for keeping my shopping list up to date.  I tell her what I need and it shows up on my smart phone.  I would recommend this to everyone.
 The audio and video quality is excellent. It doesn't seem to respond to inquires or commands quite as easily as my echo dots for some reason. I bought it bundled with a Ring Doorbell 2 and wanted to be able to quickly see who was at my door while in my family room. The problem I've had is with placement. The tables are on the sides of the couches and chairs, so the device is not facing me or others, which is likely part of the problem with the response. There's no convenient place to put it...certainly not like I see people making these things work easily in commercials. I still like it a lot. I just have to figure out how to use it more effectively.
 Not at all what I expected. Not as user Friendly as I thought. So disappointed.  😟😟😟
 Overall it is decent, here are few problems I noticed:<br/><br/>- The microphones are not as receptable as regular echo, probably due to 4 microphones on front. We placed it in a corner, and doesn't properly recognize from any side.<br/><br/>- Bug: There is an issue when we configured the echo show homepage to rotate Amazon photos album. Every two days, it  gets stuck at a photo, only way to make it work again is to restart, which is a pain point.<br/><br/>- Request: Echo devices need to support casting from mobile apps for more apps as its too much a pain-point to connect to bluetooth to play everytime. Only Amazon music is supported currently, they need to add pandora, spotify and other popular apps for casting to Echo devices as endpoints soon..
 I really like my Echo Show. The only thing that puts me off is that there is *SO* much more that it could be useful for. Would be great if it could be uses as a 2nd wireless display for your computer so you could watch TV and surf at the same time. Would also be nice if it didn't time out after three minutes when watching some video content. Would be nice if you could say "home control" and bring up your Zigbee devices, and would be wonderful if it would pair with Sylvania, Philips, and Lutron Zigbee remotes so I could eliminate that "other" hub that I have to use.
 I just unboxed and set-up my 2nd Gen Echo Show, this device sounds...AMAZING!!! Set-up was a breeze, took, all of 10 minutes with a new software update download and install. Ordered it via the Amazon mobile app, it was on sale for $179, I was prompted to trade in my 1st Gen Echo Show for $45 and then received an instant $30 gift card making the total investment $113 I originally wanted the Apple HomePod, but at $350 plus AppleCare and taxes, $400 was just too much for me to consider investing in a smart speaker. This device is worth every penny and I’m so glad I was able to snag it at such an attractive price point. Cheers.
 -Why can't the Alexa app be preinstalled on this device rocking a 10.1" HD Screen? Why??? I have to use a phone, tablet or a PC/Mac to access the Alexa app this device is supposed to portray.<br/>-Alexa dim all lights 50%!!! "Sorry all hue lights are not responding!" (Lights are offline on the Alexa App but perfectly fine on the Philips Hue app)<br/>-It is supposed to "sync" with my Philips Hue account and mirrors my HUB setup from the Philips Hue app but no! Instead of just 4 fully assigned lights, this thing discovered 4 extra factory-named lights duplicating the ones that were fully assigned. Delete the duplicates then all of a sudden "Sorry Hue Lights are not responding".<br/>-Why is there no option to raise or lower Alexa voice directly like changing volumes for media, ringtone and notification like on any regular mobile device?<br/>-Why is there no real settings to customize the Home Screen especially the CLOCK?<br/>- Why under "Lights and More" you can only toggle on/off your lights. How about dimming and stuff?<br/>- Most annoying if you're watching a video and say "turn on/off lights...!" You have to wait for it to execute the command then wait 15-20 secs before it resumes the video.<br/>Hopefully they address those issues soon otherwise I am returning it
 I am so glad I waited for the second generation and absolutely love it! However the 4 stars is because I use it in my classroom where I have a student named Alexa. We changed the wake word to “echo” but she doesn’t respond as well to it. It takes multiple repetitions to get her attention. So we ended up just switching her back to Alexa and just deal with it.
 No matter which duration I select, the photos display for one minute. There is no randomization for displaying photos. It might be random where it starts from but then it stays in that folder showing each photo before going to next folder. In between photos it shows promotional messages which is annoying. Plus it shows messages over your photos. I purchased this primarily to provide a slideshow of photos when not using Alexa and am very disappointed.
 Overall this is a nice improvement over the 1 gen Show.  I have multiple Echos and Echo Shows of all types throughout the house.  My wife is mostly blind, and as a tool for someone visually or otherwise impaired, it's simply a miracle.  I'm quite surprised that Amazon hasn't used that in their marking.  My wife calls and receives calls from all her friends and family from any room in the house.  Even in the back yard.  She plays music and controls all the lights as well with the Kasa devices.  The only reason I didn't give the new Show 5 stars is I feel the processor is a bit slow.  There seems to be a few seconds delay in responses that I don't experience with my other Echos.  But I love it.
 I bought Alexa Show as a Christmas gift for my dad who is ill. I was very excited that he can play his music by voice command since he is not technology savvy. The hope was that the voice command will allow him to listen to music when he wants. Unfortunately Alexa pays two to three songs and stops. He has become so frustrated with the process of constantly asking to play songs that can't be found, and going to Youtube and getting bumped off so frequently that in a few days he said he does not want to use it anymore because it is too stressful.<br/>My internet search shows this is an inherent problem with the system and many have sited this short coming with Alexa. I think the company is obligated to address this issue and should assist persons who bought this faulty system.<br/>I hope someone can assist.
 Full disclosure, this was a gift, so I paid nothing for it.<br/>Pros:<br/>-Good speaker<br/>-Microphone can pick up my voice really well (better than the dots)<br/>-Screen can be nice for video chat<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Speaker evoremphasizes the bass (though the bass is adjustable)<br/>-Screen never shuts off (I wish there was a power-save mode for when I am not using it)<br/>-I rarely use the screen, I feel like it is a bit of a niche thing right now<br/><br/> As it stands I like it. I give it 4 stars because I don't really think it would be worth the price, but if you have spare money, it is a nice toy.
 Just bought the new 2nd Gen Echo Show.  I bought the bundle that included Hue light bulbs as it’s advertised as being able to directly control the bulbs without need for the Hue Bridge/Hub.  But to do this you must enable the Hue skill by linking accounts.  So you go to setup a Hue account but that requires the Hue Bridge.  So you just try to link using the Alexa app....and are told it can’t find the Hue Bridge.  So a big fat waste of $50 for bulbs you can’t use as promised.  Rest of Show works as advertised but this is really misleading.
 Like this much better than 1st Gen Echo show .Much better sound, excellent larger screen , and additional useful features.Adjustable volume for music on screen and visual communication between shows etc. .I was disappointed to find a few expensive stands , but came up with a solution . Search for a 4 inch aluminum lazy susan on amazon.I purchased a few of them and they work great . You will also like the price .
 Got one of these to replace my echo dot but I don't even use all the features on it and it's pretty much a dot for me still. It's cool that it can do all of this stuff but once you do it a couple times you realize it's way easier to get out your phone and find what you are looking for on there. Alexa has a hard time of hearing me too and I find myself repeating things over and over for her to get it right and sometimes she outright doesn't respond. It's pretty cool to say you have one and all but if you are looking to use Alexa to automate your house, try an Echo dot first and then see if you need this.
 My biggest complaint about the 1st gen was the sound... it was horrible... better sound and larger screen are nice.
 I got the Echo Show to use with my alexa devices and it does a great job doing this. The issue with my Show is that the photo playlist stops every day, and the only way to restart it is to unplug it to reset it. I do this every day and sometimes twice a day. The amazon support technician wants me to reset the device back to factory settings hoping this will fix the problem. If I do this, I must reinstall every smart home device. Some of these devices were a challenge to get installed so I don't want to mess with it again.
 I have purchased a number of Echo's over the past few years and have the first generation show and love it.  This second generation puts everything to  shame.  It is stunning!  The picture and sound quality are incredible.  You could actually use the second generation show as a beside television.  I do.  I will be buying additional Echo Show's as upgrades for the other rooms in my house.  It is a wonderful product and if you sit down and learn all it can do, It can actually make your life easier.  I use Echo for all my lights, alarms, cameras, intercom, music, shows, news, cooking, etc.  It takes times and the purchase of other products to do some functions, but well worth it.  I just love the new Echo Show.  Thank you Amazon.
 Wish I had saved my money! I wanted this to replace a kindle fire I use to stream videos and live TV in my kitchen. Needless to say the kindle works better. This Echo Show does not do what it says it is doing. For example I ask for a Prime Video by name and episode (yes I am that specific) and Alexa says here’s blah blah blah (exactly what I asked for) and NOTHING plays or it says it is playing something completely different. Also cannot add apps or really do anything. Big waste of money! Use a Kindle Fire attached to an Echo.
 Although it does a lot, there are not enough games for kids to interact with the touch screen. I bought this for my son who has developmental disabilities,  to help with speech and cognitive abilities. Need more interactive activities, games which are touch screen sensitive.  For example, to play connect for you must say the location , such  as slot four, no visualization is present. On tic tac toe you must say the location such as  right column second space. If you could see it, the game would improve all learning styles. This would then become a great marketing device for those children with developmental delays but have the ability and understanding of how a computer or tablet works..
 I havent had a chance to really explore all that Alexa can do but what I see so far is amazing.  I love<br/>Alexa,  I have different models in almost every room of my house.
 I admit I thought I was buying a Kindle that also functioned as an Echo speaker.  It's my fault, but I'm going to return for a Kindle 10 and Show stand (which I understand has its own limitations).  I was shocked to realize you can't install apps like Netflix.  It's  an Echo Speaker with a screen. Everything works through Alexa and the cloud.  I’m sure it’s great for its intended audience but not what I was expecting.
 This generation of Alexa sound great, we did have a problem with it at first, we didn’t know it had an equalizer so when it came it was factory set with the bass and midrange set halfway up the scale which ended up blowing the speakers once we turned it up, Amazon was good about sending us a new one in just a couple days and having us send the one we had back so they could analyze it since it had just came out at that time. But besides that, it works great and sounds great, I would suggest buying it......... just turn down the bass a bit before cranking up the tunes.
 The pics are twice as good as Gen1. The sound....oy-vay!!......10 times better than Gen1. Can get a good thump thump.Pretty darn cool if you ask me. Has a tad more weight to it but guessing from the added speaker magnets. Jaw jacking with others is totally worth it.
 Nice design, big upgrade on video and sound quality. Also, with the second generation model came new software features, like Hulu video.<br/><br/>I purchased the first gen show last year and to be honest It became a music player with a screen. Minus the occasional video call with someone else, that was it's primary use. The screen was pretty small in comparison to the second model and I never would have considered watching anything on it.<br/><br/>The second generation feels like a small TV (requires Hulu w/live TV) in my kitchen on top of being an Alexa / music device.<br/><br/>It also just looks much nicer on my kitchen counter
 I have two first gen. Echo Shows and now this second gen. Show. All are five-star IMHO.  The only problem I have is, it is definitely NOT worth the upgrade. During the course of a routine day, I use all three equally and don't really care which one it is. The software on the 1st gens seems to have been updated too.
 Where to begin.  The speakers on the echo show V2 sound fantastic with the bass produced quite literally astounding. I did have to turn the bass down just a tad to stop slight distortion at 100%. Otherwise i have clear, crisp audio on full blast with bass that easily fills a room. The large screen and amazon music are magic with lyrics scrolling across the very nice 720p display. The cooking capabilities are awesome and the ability to control my hue smart bulb lights using the built in zigbee hub is awesome! The screen although beautiful seems to be where amazon may have cheaped out or i may have just been very unlucky. I had my show running for a solid two weeks and sadly the screen couldn't keep up. I came home from work only to find long streaks going across my echo screen. For a device that is meant to be on 24/7 you'd think a better more reliable panel would've been installed. To make matters worse the policy for replacement is a joke. I called and was polity greeted to being told i'd have to send it in for repair rather than what I had expected. What should've happened is i should've had a new show sent out with prime shipping and a return label for the defective one. I understand that people lie to get a second product but that is where the customer would be charged for the second product upon failure to send back the defective one. So for now i am without my show for the next 4-5 business days. The customer should never have to experience down time or feel penalized for having a defective product. In short I love the product but am very frustrated with the support I received.
 The only noticeable Improvement what's the largest screen. I've noticed no improvement in voice recognition compared to the Echo gen 1, Echo spot and Echo Show. The different LED lights that indicate whether you have an alert , message, delivery or any of the other statuses have been removed. There is no visual indication that triggers you to check the device if you're not next to it anymore. If you happen to be next to the device and the notification appears it disappears within four seconds so you barely have any time to read it. When a reminder appears on the screen it's always shows the current time at that moment that you are looking at the screen. it's very confusing if you look at the screen after the time that a reminder first appears because the screen always shows the current time next to the reminder instead of the time reminder was due. You can't tell how many minutes have passed just a reminder became due. I definitely prefer the Generation 1. This product seems rushed and it's lacking many of the features of his predecessor and no real Improvement besides a larger screen
 While I wish there were more video options like Netflix, the sound on this is AMAZING and totally fills the room with full range sound. We bought this to use in the kitchen and the All Recipes skill is great. Just wish there were more options to watch TV or Movies on it since it has a nice large screen.
 We are just getting to know this product, but it is pretty freakin' awesome!!!  While doing a video call with my brother (who sent me this for Christmas, we had to be careful not to say "Alexa" because she will try to interrupt the call.  To avoid that we started calling her the "one that starts with an A"...I do wish it came with a printed manual.  I know there is so much more we can do with it!!!  It will be fun to learn.  Brother also sent a smart bulb, so she is now turning on/off and dimming bulb too!!
 I just received my Alexa Show today and love it.  It was so easy to set up.  So far, I have only listened to the music and it has a nice deep sound.  Alexa us a bit loud and if I turn her down, the music is also turned down but that is no biggie.  I can always tell her volume up/down.  I pulled up the prime videos on it and that is cool.  I pulled up appointments and she pulled up my weekly events.  Love it.  I have a lot more to learn but this is really coo and convenient.
 Time will tell but currently it doesn't work smoothly with Hulu or Ring Products. Ring I was able to open 1 out of 5 times. Hulu it just stared back at me doing nothing. Had everything installed and linked. Nothing.
 I bought this on Cyber Monday and so far I love it.  I look forward to having more features in the future, but right now it is great.  I also got one for my distant family and we are able to keep in touch so much better.  My kids are able to talk with their grandparents and I don't have to worry about compatibility.
 I am really enjoying slowly adding smart devices to my home. I love the  versatility of this device. I purchased 2, and sent one to one of our children who is grown and moved out. It definitely makes for better communication with them. The only 2 design flaws I have are: first, it doesn’t have an internal battery. So if I want to move it from the living room to the kitchen, to follow a recipe, I have to unplug and set the whole device up there. 2nd, it dosent come with an integrated stand that you can control the tilt or swivel with. I had to order a separate stand, I. Order to adjust the angle so the camera could see everyone in the living room. Other than that, I love it
 Before you buy, make sure you don't mind rotating "Things to try" messages at the bottom of the screen. You can see them now in some of the product images. Just know you can't turn them off on the main screen.  They just keep rotating and rotating and rotating. After reading the Alexa SDK docs, it is clear Amazon really likes this feature.  It is core to their UX.  See 8.2.2 at https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-voice-service/functional-requirements.html  After spending two days with the echo show, all I see now is "Try ... Google Home"
 Pros<br/> - Costs less than the original Echo<br/> - much better speakers - more bass<br/> - much larger screen and seems sharper / cleaner<br/> - optional stand to allow tilting<br/> - now comes in two colors<br/><br/>Cons<br/> - I wish it had an optional tilt/swivel stand<br/> - no follow-me camera - always points in one direction<br/><br/>Overall I like the new Echo.  Our family is an Echo based automation eco-system and Echo Show II is a great addition.
 I love the suggestions that scroll across the bottom, it has helped me to use it more than I used the echoes, I also love the lyrics with the music, who knew I was singing so many songs wrong?!?  I would love to see the date on the home screen but that’s minor and will hopefully be added later!  I highly recommend
 Way better than Echo. Alexa speaks clearly. The screen very bright and  huge compared to the 1st generation. I still have not used it’s full functionality as far as watching Hulu and adding home security. Maybe, later. Adding them adds up to the cost. I just added the prime music.  I am glad I bought it as I have always been complaining about me and Alexa not understanding each other. It’s better with the screen than talking to a speaker. Glad I purchased it.
 I wanted to write an initial review and provide updates later.<br/><br/>I’m happy with the picture quality when I check I’m on my kids. I ordered a stand for it because it doesn’t tilt or move and I was only able to see the top of my kids foreheads.<br/><br/>I haven’t figured out the audio setting but it has too much bass for my liking.<br/><br/>“Dropping in” With the dot was horrible because of the sound quality so I’m much happier with the Echo Show.
 I found the following immediately noticeable:<br/>1) Heavy unit, but makes sense as the weight is necessary to prevent the unit from vibrating on the surface it sits on.<br/>2) Sound quality is noticeably richer with more bass than 1st Gen<br/>3) Larger screen is much easier to read and watch videos (or webcam) than 1st Gen<br/>While it is still expensive, IMHO, the improved audio and screen size justifies the spend assuming you have discretionary cash.
 It does what is supposed to do but almost feels restricted with limited features. It desperately needs some sort of apps and onscreen keyboard to realize its true potential. You Tube and Radio feature work but seem to have a mind of its own on understanding what you ask to hear or watch. It occasionally stops mid way for no apparent reason while streaming radio and videos. It feels like you bought a car but have a donkey pulling it. I do love the audio quality and speakers on this thing.
 Sound and picture are very good. We were looking for something to allow us to watch HGTV in the kitchen and assumed we could use use any of the apps (such as HGTV app) like the fire TV. That was an incorrect assumption, it does allow access to all the streaming services such as the FireTV does (at this point only what Amazon wants) we can stream HGTV through HULU for an added cost. I don’t believe you can add the FireTV either. Otherwise we are happy with the purchase.
 I’m giving the echo show five stars because I do love all of the news and information that displays on the big screen. However, the primary reason I purchased it was for the ability to have video calls with my friends.  While the video clarity is very nice, everybody I know that has an Alexa show, or an Alexa spot, no matter where you place them you’re always staring at people ceilings. I have had two echo show and was hoping the updated version might better resolve this issue, but I still have to place something (book, magazine, etc) underneath the back of it to aim it in an acceptable viewing angle. I do hope they can consider lowering the camera angle or providing an option to some height rotation in future versions of the Show.
 We really like the show, however the device does not allow to show our pictures in Amazon photos when we use the settings on the device. It stopped showing them completely. I reset the machine and worked with customer service on this. We started asking Alexa to show photo's which works but it can not repeat the slide show more than once even though the instructions on the help page in Amazon says to say Alexa repeat photos, it does not repeat them.
 I have several 1St&amp;2nd generations. Hands down 2nd Gen is the best so far until the 3rd come out!<br/>With that being said.<br/>My Echo is my Personal Assistant... Echo set an announcement (Honey I Quit! Make your own dinner!  Lol... I Love You) reminders..appointments Literally!<br/>Also my Deejay...who doesn't want to wake up to their favorite artists.. Weather/Traffic Man... Assistant Chef...Video Consultant. Etc.......<br/>I can go on and on.  But what I love the most is the efficiency with today's updates on quality gadgets. Gadget maybe cruel to say... My Echo is My Echo. Until it get up and walk out the house on it's own!  😂
 I haven't used this product to it's full potential yet.  But it's great.  I love being able to watch Hulu while in the kitchen cooking.  The only thing I can complain about the Hulu app so far is that I don't seem to see a way to choose an episode for a series.  It picks up where it's left off.  Even asking Alexa for a specific season and episode, it will only play the next one to be watched.<br/>Other than that, it's great.  The sound is loud enough where I can hear it over fans and vents while cooking in the kitchen.  I did buy the stand for it, because I didn't quite like the angle it provides.
 I've got almost all of the o es you make.. have given them to friends and they all love it ....the new Alexa 10 inch screen is great ..keep up the good work ...have family in Tennessee great picture great sound ...I live in California....
 With the new screen size and resolution, it's almost perfect. I use Alexa quite a bit around my home. (I'm not that lazy really!) Next I'll try the telephone calling feature and see how that works. But as far as movies, music....etc, it's quite an improvement from the first gen. Echo Show.
 Turning off things to try!!! I hate this annoying line on the bottom of my screen!! I went to rotate once but it is still coming back!  AMAZON  UPDATE TO ALLOW TURN OFF THIS ANNOYING FEATURE!! Will change to 5 stars when options given to remove things to try off screen!!

And so far I am loving it . I have WiFi Led bulbs, WiFi power plugs, led strips, and more Alexa enabled devices, and they all work almost seemlessly. Ya just have to be very specific when setting up everything. If anybody has any suggestions on an all in one skill or app that can control most or all Alexa devices please reply and let me know. Because I haven’t found anything that I can integrate all my stuff into. Thanks. I really like this device thanks for a great deal on Black Friday Amazon...
 The Show is living up to it's expectations and then some.  We have ours in the kitchen which is basically the nucleus of our house and everyone uses it from music, timers, measurements, news, games and more.  We currently have two wifi outlets in our house and the set up was easy for Show to control these outlets and have already ordered more outlets and will be getting a camera system in the near future.  Also bought two spots, one for my daughter's room and one for our master bedroom.  The Show is everything that was expected and more.
 Hands down the sound quality of the new Echo Show is superior to the Sonos Play5 at a fraction of the price.  I'm replacing 11 Play5's with Show's and 2 Sonos bridges with Echo Dots plugged into my existing audio amps.<br/><br/>You need to experience it to believe it.  I've been missing half the music with Sonos.  The Echo Show truly brings the music alive with all the highs and lows in Dolby and voice commands from any room in the house.
 I am not one to normally submit reviews but I was highly disappointed in this device. I understand that it’s not suppose to replace a tablet but it’s not user friendly. I wanted it for my kitchen to help me with recipes we all know how annoying your phone locking mid cook and having to unlock it to continue the recipe well if the recipe isn’t in Allrecipes and you open it in the browser when you walk away it closes the browser. If that’s not annoying enough when you tell Alexa to open up the browser again it doesn’t open the page you had so you have to search again. I did not realize you cannot do something as simple as Bluetooth to it which is disappointing for a 200$ Device, since I had the original audible I cannot even listen to books on it as my audible will not convert to Amazon. Honestly just not user friemdly for what I was expecting I will keep my dot for things like controlling smart home devices with my voice but am returning the show.
 I absolutely love my echo!!!  From calling the grandkids, to music ( sound is awesome), to even watching movies.  Games love jeopardy and who wants to be a millionaire.  Weather just ask and news updates when wanted.  There’s nothing I don’t like about the echo.
 Great (in call) video quality, the microphone also provides clear (in call) audio even when the person is far away from the unit. Once synced it provides a very easy smart home integration. When listening to music it also provides lyrics. I have only played with it a day but this far a great tech product!
 Would be a five star review except for one major flaw that should be an easy fix.<br/>I have the cloud cam in my nursery and use it as a baby monitor which works GREAT. I can view the camera on my phone, tablet, Fire tv (of which all our TVs primarily use) and now I can ask my new echo show to display the nursery as well which works great as a night stand monitor! Only problem is I also use Alexa to control various lights and switches throughout my house and when I ask my show to perform a smart home command like “turn off bedroom lights” when it’s time to go to sleep, it leaves my nursery cam then displays a control screen for whichever device or group the command was for. Which would be fine for a short while so long as it returned back to the nursery camera... it doesn’t... it displays the smart home control for a bit then goes to the home screen... forcing me to have to ask it to display the nursery again. This is very frustrating. As soon as this problem is fixed I will edit review to 5star.
 There seems to be a reason Amazon is giving these devices for free.<br/>The device is great looking and sounds pretty good.<br/>HOWEVER, that is where everything stops.<br/>The user interface for Alexa and Echo is absolutely garbage.<br/>I tried to find another word to not be too crude, but, I couldn't.<br/>Amazon, I'm sorry. I'm a huge fan of your great customer service and products.<br/>Why did you design such a useless device from the ground up?<br/>Say you want to play some songs on your pandora, well you will need to use at least 2 devices. You have to configure the station on a computer after going into 10 subselections (really well hidden). Then start pandora with a voice command on your Echo show. That absolutely defeats the purpose of having a smart speaker with a user interface.<br/>Amazon, please allow people to use the screen on the echo show to configure apps, otherwise you sold a very good looking paper weight.
 No setup needed. What, does she learn from the others? interesting. Sound is much better screen is bigger and of course so is the font so I can tell what time it is without putting on my glasses. All in all much better!! haven'y found the negatives yet. Just plugged it in a little while ago and ran through lights and webcams. Now sipping glass of wine listening to Dan Folgelberg radio on Pandora. The screen resolution seems better but I could be wrong.
 If you have 5000+ photos uploaded to your amazon photos account and want the echo show 2nd gen to rotate through them on your homescreen it won't do it. I just went through my second one and had the exact same problem as my first echo show 2nd gen. I only had my second echo show 2nd gen for a 12h and it had already stopped rotating through my photos twice now on the homescreen. I have a third one but I'm sure it will just end in the same result. Amazon should've done more Q/A before releasing the echo show 2nd gen. Apparently this is common bug with echo show 2nd gen. Other than that it works extremely well with other smart devices that's why I gave it 3 stars out of 5. I will update the review once the problem is fixed but I don't anticipate this problem being fixed anytime in the near future.
 My whole family has one and uses it, I saw them but didn't think I needed it. Now that I have one (as an xmas gift from family), I don't know why I didn't get one before. The ability to torn on and off lights, ask questions, shopping lists, and even order from Amazon- well pretty darn cool.
 Easy to use, although I wish there were more printed instructions with it.<br/>Our grandkids are far away and this is wonderful, especially since they can do it with a voice command.<br/>Picture and sound are great. Glad I bought generation 2 versions<br/>Amazing how you can call and not use the actual phone of the other person.<br/>Well worth the price.<br/>The quality of the sound it can produce is amazing.<br/>Gr and kids just say "alexa, call grandpa" and away we go.
 The echo show is a beautiful device! All of my friends that have come over have ended up getting one to. It controls all of my smart devices in our house. Two things that would make it even better is to have a slide show setting. I can tell it to show my pictures and it does beautifly, but it defaults back to the home screen if any messages pop up. I also have an Amazon cloud cam, the echo show will tell you someone was detected at the front door but not give you a video feed to show you without you verbally telling it to do so each time. That should be a setting that we choose to make automatic.
 This 2nd generation is awesome. Large viewing screen. The speakers are in the back and deliver full, rich sound. It’s amazing how full the sound is on this Echo Show. The larger display makes watching movies so much more enjoyable. Truly an awesome product well worth the price.
 I'm not a gadget person, but what the heck, so I purchased 3, one for each household in my immediate family. I drugged them out of the stone ages too. Poor Alexa is now turning on lamps, checking security cameras and pausing movies... she was easy to set up, which for non geekers is important and she's even easier to talk to. Yes, this was the best gift to self ever
 This is my first time using an Echo Show and it is great. I love the way you can see some of your requests on the screen. For example asking for recipes and seeing them on the screen is a great help. Along with some of the skills I have been using have displays that I never was able to view since my only experience with an Echo was an Echo Dot. The sound on this is awesome love listening to music on this. I have not had a chance to try Hulu on it just yet. So far I am very impressed with this echo show and look forward to finding new things I can use it for daily.

 It’s much much better then first generation Echo: bigger and better (now in HD) screen, bigger and richer sound.
 I put the Alexa echo show in my kitchen. I already have Alexa devices throughout my home but first Alexa show. Extremely easy set up and the graphics are crisp. Also the speakers are great. We connected it to Hulu, Prime and it even plays YouTube on demand. I have to agree with another reviewer that I wish it had a search capability or a home screen to navigate (like an iPad). All commands are verbal or through touchscreen once you land on a page. Bottom line - love it! I bought it on Black Friday so got a good deal - if they were cheaper, I’d buy more!
 My kids got the Echo Show for me for Christmas so that I could video chat with them.  I successfully downloaded the app.  However, it would not connect with my phone version 4.4.4.  After an extensive search online to trouble shoot, it appears that Echo Show was not designed to connect to a phone with a version less than 5.0.  So disappointed!  The Echo Show does do a lot of interesting things.  Just too bad I won't be able to connect to other Echo Shows.  Won't be able to purchase a new phone for some time.
 ....So much less user friendly than it should be.  It does not come with a web browser or any platform to download apps from the device itself.<br/>You find yourself basically guessing what to ask it to do, because the home page does not have any icons.  The speaker is great, if not way too bass-y (great for music, bad for Alexa).  You can’t just ask it to turn the volume down,  (Of course not, because that would make too much sense on a machine that’s designed for voice commands...) you have to walk across the room and press the buttons on the top of the device to do that.<br/>It’s a much bigger (bulky) wedge shape than you’d expect, and hefty at 5ish pounds.<br/>It should be much better than it is right out of the box.<br/>If we didn’t receive this as a Christmas gift, we wouldn’t keep it.
 I like the sound and picture quality but its a real hassle to connect to u-tube or internet feel like I bought a nice raido I have 3 dots 2 fire tv and 1 echo plus and have no problems but this is hard to learn and I don't like the fact that I have to buy a book to learn how to use your product, SHAME ON YOU AMAZON I guess I will go on u tube to try in learn the echo show  or but a goggle it comes with direction
 We are still learning about it.  But it can do almost everything we have asked.  Even finds classical music that I listened to back in the '70s.  Took our first video phone call from our daughter on Christmas, and it was easy and so 21st Century!  This rocks!!!!!
 This product is wonderful for anyone in advanced years or mobility limited. You can "visit" with loved ones (assuming they have one which is why I bought one for everyone in family). The best part is taking away the worry of not seeing the one you love. Now, we all visit in real time and home health wellness checks can wait alittle longer. Highly recommend this product for those who cant travel but want to stay in touch.
 I don’t know who enjoys Alexa most, me or my 4yr old son. I love getting news and weather updates daily. My son loves to ask Alexa to tell him jokes and he repeat these corny jokes to me....hilarious! Alexa is also teaching us Spanish. We ask her to tell us words and phrases in Spanish, it’s so cool. The set up was simple especially for someone who’s not tech savvy. We watch movies, listen to music, turn light on and off, make calls, set alarms, and so much more! I don’t know what took me so long to get one. I’m still learning what all my echo show is capable of but so far I’m more than pleased with this purchase.
 This was a last minute thought for my wife’s Christmas this year. I had seen one in Best Buy and thought “kinda neat gizmo” wasn’t sure how it would be useful. But when it arrived (right on schedule yay Amazon) it was impressive right out of the box. Not a techie here but I was able to get it up and running in minutes. The screen runs through suggestions that give you ideas for what you can do with it. I added Amazon music unlimited, which allows you to ask it to play any song you want. And I cannot believe the sound quality! I was watching Amazon prime movies right off the bat. Beautiful bright screen no buffering. My wife took to it immediately and seems to love it. We will definitely be adding accessories to start building a “smart home”, light and thermostat control. Nice when you’re getting ready in a hurry for work and ask for weather and calendar events. Impressive quality item, I haven’t compared the capabilities against the Google hub, but as a family that’s moderately connected with Amazon, I have to believe this a better choice for us!
 Its pathetic if you ask for a orthopedic address instead it gives you ortho club. If you ask for a name ut week give you another club and will repeat previous address.  The Alexa Tower works better in answering.  Will see how it does for other information. I had 2 other Echo Show and were return for faulty issues. Hope this new Generation Echo works better. I just plugged it in. And not responding correctly.
 The Echo is just HORRIBLE.  I ask for simple things like a spaghetti recipe by Ina Garten (she only has hundreds of recipes on the net) and Alexa tells me  “sure” and then proceeds to bring up every spaghetti recipe on the planet but NONE by Ina Garten.  So then I go to my cookbook and get the EXACT NAME OF A RECIPE BY INA GARTEN - maybe I have done something wrong.  I give this to Alexa which SHE CAN’T FIND??  She can answer about 1 in every 50 questions I ask her. However she seems to be excellent at suggesting products and services I could buy from AMAZON.  (imagine that!!)  I got this as a gift for Christmas, I did not buy it. If I had I would be demanding a refund!! But, I’m going to put the device in some unused room in the house and forget her.  WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!
 I can’t stand how the screen is always on. I’m always having to tell it to turn off. The screen does need to be on all night or when I’m not at home. I’m not sure why but I have an Echo 3rd gen in my den. Somehow, from the kitchen the Show is delayed at responding to my summon whereas the Echo responds first. Other then that, I’m ok with the Show. I would rather buy the Echo 3rd gen over the gimic screen.
 I love the Echo Show. It was a gamble buying it because I did not know all the ins and outs of using it -- but there's info on line to help. I'm still learning what Alexa can do. The sound is great - the images are nice and sharp and I like the idea that the time and weather appears every day without asking Alexa to turn it on. Good buy for the money, especially when you can buy it at a discount like I did. Great buy for young and old!
 I would purchase this again and again. We have a dot in all of our childrens rooms, and this in the kitchen. We love all of the different things you can do- such as 'drop in' on our kids and talk to them through the echo/dot. or send announcements to every alexa device. My son is even able to call me on my cell phone using this device and use the video chat with me. I love all the features and the sound is amazing!
 The wife loves it. We had the first edition of the Echo Show in the kitchen. We replaced it with the second edition. She loves it. Most people are not taking advantage of everything this thing can do. Our whole house is Alexa enabled.
 I just can’t say enough wonderful things about my Echo Show. I just love it. Chrystal clear, much bigger screen than my old one. Moved my one one into the kitchen but had to name them different names so they don’t get confused with one another. So many skills available. I love being able to see my front doof and yard using the integrated Ring skill. Music sounds great.  I just love this and would highly recommend it.
 I had the Echo Show 1 and decided to upgrade actually bought an additional one for a friend.  The sound is outstanding and picture too.  I enjoy searching for all of the things that can be done on this device. I just found out that the screen can be turned off.
 I’m just not sure what to think now.  Alexa’s voice is not clear.  It seems loud and very muffled and spitty.  (Is this a word?). I’ve adjusted the bass, treble, and mid, to no avail.  Is there something amiss with just mine, or is this common?<br/>I have the first one, and all is very clear.
 I guess I had higher expectations for the echo show. I don’t feel I got a major upgrade from just using the dots. Everything is meant to be done by voice control but honestly that isn’t always convenient. For example, we really wanted to use this for recipes. So I setup the push buttons for Firefox, then click on Pinterest, then find recipe, click on it to open full recipe. So far these are all pretty standard items. But the screen goes back to the home screen after so much time, haven’t found the setting to change this yet, and then you have to start ALL over. The webpage you were on is gone!  The show also doesn’t really act as a hub anymore than the app on my phone does for the Dots. I really don’t see the point of the show over an app and the dots.
 Okay. If you expect to have complete control over what is displayed on your screen, Foget that!! Amazon feels the need to constantly put a “Try ######” nag on your screen. So far I’ve found no way to remove it except to just return the dang thing.
 We bought two, one for us and another for a gift.  Love it, easy to use and it's fun to continue to learn everything it can do.  The speakers are great and we are going to sign up for the music ( they offer a 6 month free trial with purchase)
 I really loved my Echo dot and then I got the All-new Echo show and it has far exceeded my expectations. It's the coolest gadget ever. The screen is large and crystal clear. I am really enjoying all the features and cooking classes.
 The echo show is a great product. We purchased two, one for us and one for our daughter in Hawaii.  It is great to drop in and visit.  She drops in over her breakfast coffee which is our lunch time.  The music sound is much improved over our old echo.  I particularly like the recipes feature where Alexa talks through the recipe step by step.<br/>  Well worth the investment.
 What's not to like with the Gen 2 Echo Show?  I think it really is a BIG improvement over Gen 1!!!  The bigger screen is very nice but the sound is a huge improvement.  It's the difference between Dot audio (which is.... OK, I guess) and Echo Plus audio which is excellent.  I decided to hold on to my Show gen 1 because I tried it out in the smallest room in the house and the audio sounded better there.
 Screen is good.sound is better. Browser in place is very useful.Dont forget to order stand since the screen is aligned low stand is very useful.
 My new,Amazon Echo Show 2nd Generation vastly exceeded/surpassed my Great Expectations. I'm very happy and satisfied with its premium quality and extraordinary audio quality. It's like Bose and JBL. Do yourself a favor/kindness and buy yourself one for Christmas. Mine is Sandstone.
 The new screen and speakers are far superior to the old ones. Nice that you can watch YouTube using web browser, shame it doesn’t have a built in app. With Hulu live, you can watch tv on screen. Great for when working in kitchen.
 Awful speech recognition, compared with other devices.  Also, Alexa doesn't seem to understand simple questions, unless phrased exactly as the system is programmed (unlike intuitive systems like Android and Siri).  Lastly, installing apps is a pain- you have to do it from another device.  1 star for ease of ordering toilet paper, but such a pain to do everything else.
 We bought 2 of these.  One for the kitchen and another for the game room.  We absolutely love them.  We have 5 echoes overall and use them multiple times a day.  Drop in, announcements, and reminders are just some of main uses we have for these.
 Likes: great speaker with plenty of base and quality sound. It sounds best if backed up to a wall or other structure. Uses: listen to music with iHeart radio- allows you to select stations, control volume, stop and start music.  Use to view Wyze cameras, video call friend who has a show. I already had a dot and this does all the same functions as the dot: controlling smart plugs and Ecobee thermostat. Dislikes: none yet. Have had it for two weeks.
 This product has great potential if you have a smart phone.  We don't! The Alexa Communications Ap for calling contacts has to be installed on a smart phone.  Without it you can not make visual calls. They down load your phone contacts through Alex Communications for Echo Show.  We still have our two flipflops phone because it is only $50 a month for unlimited texting through Verizon designed for retirees on a fixed income.  I hope Amazon doesn't ignore the grandparent market who would enjoy the visual phone calls of their grandchildren as advertised on the commercial and develops a software ap, so Alex Communications can be compatible with Office "People contacts."  Presently I use a Verizon text application on my computer so I can type texts on a real keyboard - my laptop when texting.  Amazon Echo show team should talk to Verizon.  Now it does the same as a the tower which is 1/3 the price. "Alex, what's the weather?"  A frustrated grandparent
 It's a nice upgrade from the Gen 1, but still has the same problem of the background photos getting "stuck", when they're supposed to continually shuffle through the album(s) selected. I've gotta unplug it 2 or 3 times every day. Not pleased at all.
 Bought 2 and set both with background to Amazon Photo album.  Both worked for a while,  now each is stuck on a different photo from the album.
 It's like having HAL from 2001 Space Odyssey right here in the kitchen.  Video directions for recipes, shopping list and just about any info your heart desires.  Just need to learn how to ask.  Video phone calls remind me of the old jetson cartoons.  To us this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Set-up takes some know how and some trial and error, but it is worth the effort... a great tool for the kitchen and just about anywhere else. Also use to monitor security cameras.
 I've got Echo's (Gen1, Dots, Tap, all except Show) all over my house and figured I'd add an Echo Show to the Kitchen.  Seemingly nice addition, but realized fairly quickly that the screen is really rather useless.  I ask it to search for recipe for dinner for instant pot...only searched one site...great (sigh).  Got more specific and asked for my favorite vegetarian chili mac recipe for instant pot...couldn't find it because it only searches one site (and nothing else).  Tried to watch some videos which wasn't very intuitive...also a fail.<br/><br/>I mean, it's a touch screen, so theoretically it's like a tablet, right?  Um...no.<br/><br/>If you just want visual output for Alexa, then this device is it.  If you want anything else, including something which can make managing your life or home easier, then you might consider the Google Home Hub or even a inexpensive tablet instead.
 Wish it had a built-in swivel stand and a way to tilt the camera so callee can see us better,<br/>Good product for the money....picks up voice commands from across the room very nicely.<br/>I like the visible timer countdown...makes anticipation of event.<br/>Music sounds good when playing (better than our DOT) similar to First Gen ECHO speaker tone.<br/>All round good product.
 Like the larger screen. Easy to see across room. May need to retrain as doesnt always understand. Like newer feature to show the commands on screen, at least some, and can see result such as “light off” and shows a switch off.
 I got this for FREE with a cyber Monday purchase I made and I don't even want it. This thing is terrible... I don't even keep it plugged in anymore because it isn't worthy of using electricity. Do not buy this. I love tech and was more than willing to give this a shot, but its just garbage. Save yourself the aggravation and just get a Fire HD 10 tablet instead.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Decent speakers<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Just about everything.<br/>- It is heavy and oddly shaped<br/>- Touchscreen is useless since you need to ask Alexa to do anything on the device<br/>- Heavily reliant on the Alexa App configuration to do anything.<br/>- On screen keyboard is split to the left and right of the screen. Placed a microphone icon in the middle to force you to talk to Alexa who doesn't understand you half the time. (Try entering a domain name in the web browser using Alexa, what laugh)<br/>- No such thing as multitasking on this device.
 PROS: Echo show 2 sounds AWESOME, it works great and feels like a very sturdy/solid build with good components. The screen is pretty nice as well and seems to have good resolution.<br/>CONS: I just want the clock and weather and don’t really care about the rest of the options. The problem is I can’t seem to find the ability to even enlarge the clock which SHOULD be unlikely that they wouldn’t have the option to change for elderly or vision impaired. I also haven’t seen it work with my nest door bell yet so I hope there’s a way to fix that.
 Don’t buy into this thing needing a stand, it doesn’t.  Just got this thing and it’s had to be reset twice already and it’s not exactly sleek as you could handily use it to bludgeon someone (it’s a lot heavier than we expected it to be). It’s handy having the screen but seriously just stuck with the show app on fire tablet with a stand and it would be just as good and cheaper
 Very nice I love the bigger screen and the sound is nice all in all I love it
 We have all Echo devices and all generations except the battery powered devices. The most versatile, most useful, and our favorite is this Echo Show 2nd gen.  Specially useful when video calling friends and family, looking at the house cameras including the front door, singing Karaoke right on its screen, watching a movie while cooking in the kitchen, following a recipe, etc.
 Lots of uses - my parents appreciate this gift as they have a smart home. Now they can control their Sonos, Smart TV, thermostat...etc. all by using this device. My Dad especially loves Prime music w/ lyrics that pop up to follow along. In idle mode we can see upcoming calendar invitations, weather and several other ways to customize. FANTASTIC holiday gift - I'm buying one for myself
 I have 6 Echo products and I love all of them, but the show really takes this type of device to a new level.  We listen to a lot of music and the Show has the lyrics to every song scrolling on the screen.  The speakers are quite good too, and putting it in a corner or next to a wall will give you great sound and good bass.  It has so many great functions, I will definitely replace all of my Echo devices with the Show over the next few months.
 Finally Amazon has a masterpiece which showcases the best use of Amazon ecosystem while at the same satisfying your every need and becoming a family member.News and Trevia alerts as per my preferences show on my screen all day.When the alert interests me I say Alexa what’s  the story to hear or see complete details. I can video  call my friends who are in my contact list. It is a labor saving device as it answers all my queries and I don’t need to Google any more. I can ask Alexa to show photos which it has uploaded from my phone or ask for a specific family members photo or an album by name and it sets it up as a screen saver. It clicks selfies with different themes. I can  check my cameras, listen to music,set timer, broadcast,announce and simultaneously launch music in all my echos.it also displays temperature and calendar appointments.
 Purchased two. One for me and my mom. She leaves in Texas and I in Kansas. The video and voice quality is outstanding when making a call. Really makes the distance apart seem less. I also use it with my security cameras. That’s another reason to buy even if you don’t know anyone who owns the Show or a Spot. The other features found on the Echo and Dot are icing on the cake.
 I upgraded my original Echo Show to the new 2nd generation Echo Show. The larger screen was worth the money spent.
 I love our Echo Show (a Christmas gift from my daughter and son-in-law)!  I use it every day for listening to my favorite tunes on my venues and playing my favorite family album pics.  It also allows me to call and physically see anyone who has an Echo Show.  I use it for information, reminders, time clocks, traffic, and any other info I need.  It was so easy to set up.  We love Alexa!
 I absolutely love the larger screen and the sound of the speakers. Another outstanding product from Amazon.
 Very nice product. The sound is amazing - better than my Sonos One. I love the big screen. Alexa is very helpful with cooking. It’s the best kitchen companion device ever.
 Great graphics. Big screen. Good volume. But I have to keep yelling Alexa and y’all slower than normal to ensure Alexa hears my command. For the amount of money, I shouldn’t need to keep repeating myself.
 This is a very simple device to set up and use on a regular basis.  It is much more responsive to voice commands than the original echo and the screen is very clear and responsive.  The only question I have is the amount of data that is sent over the wi-fi and consequently the internet connection.  Unfortunately I live in a rural area and am limited to 15 gig per month.  Something is eating my data limit in 5 days and I kind of suspect the new echo.
 I have I have 4 of these in my home.  I am thinking about purchasing 2 more for extra rooms and perhaps another for my office.  One the second generation, I like the feature of the bigger screen space and the fact that the connector cord comes apart from the Alex box enables me to use more conveniently at my office as there is a hole on top of my desk to drop cords and plug into the electrical outlet alleviating all of the cords on my desk surface in my office.<br/><br/>I love this product, and have talked my sister and my cousin into buying them for their children homes as a x-mas gift.  I think one bought 6 and the other bought 5!  They all love them!<br/><br/>Thanks for Amazon for bringing another great purchase.to my attention.<br/><br/>I want to make sure my Amazon Prime membership is continuously active!<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>Ginny Slay
 We love our Echo show! Now we can see who's at the front door from our Ring device and we can see what our kids are up to through the Wyze cam. The audio is also way better than our echo dot.
 Amazon has another hit on there hand with this device. the size is good for what it is the screen is clear and sharper nd yet you don't get a lot of choppy video.<br/>As a dedicate Skype terminal... why has it take so long this is the video calling device promised in all those old movies.<br/>the one feature I would add is a video out ... ideally controllable (Alexa put video on the TV)
 The larger screen makes viewing so much more clearer and easier to see from a distance. The sound quality<br/>is very good, much more balanced than the previous version, I have both. A good step forward.
 I've had an Echo since the original device.  I really like this Echo Show.  It's quick and responsive.  I was a little apprehensive about whether or not the microphones would pick up my voice from multiple locations.  I found this not to be a problem.  The speakers sound great, and definitely have some bass to them.  Best sounding Echo device yet!
 It took a long time to get here but it works as expected. Why oh why can’t they have a cordless verizon though? It’s not like you can sit it in the middle of your table now is it... damn cord running across the floor plugged into an extension cord. And it you want to take it to the kitchen to use a receipe you have to wait for it to reboot. Sheesh
 I have recently taken the steps to almost fully turn my home into a smart home with Alexa enabled devices. I did have a Echo Spot in my open kitchen/living room but i felt that it was not really what I needed. The speakers are the main reason i upgraded but I did not realize how much I would enjoy just asking Alexa to find me recipes and not having to print it out or get food particles all over my phone. Also with the use of some of the available apps and skills it can give you a TV where you didn't have one before. I used to not be able to see my TV while i was at the stove but now i can watch TV while I am Cooking. When all is said and done if you want a device in you kitchen space I think that this is the one to go with, but other than that I am not sure if it fits anywhere else in the home.
 Don't get wrong,  I like this device.. it is cool and has many uses.  Love the Silk Browser, visible alarm features, but i think it is a missed opportunity for some basic features that would bring it to the next level.  Such as, Netflix, a touch icon-based home screen, videos playing with Amazon music.  Its like Amazon forgets it has a screen.
 If I  love it why 4 stars... Alexa is having a hard time hearing my commands, I have to repeat her its name for it to wake up plus the speakers are on the back so I have to have the volume up a bit higher than with my first generation echo show other than that I love it. The screen is larger and that is awesome! I'm buying more as soon as I can!
 So far, I can watch movies, view my outside security cameras, turn lights on and off and a million other things.  I love this device and just ordered them for both of my sons as holidays gifts for their homes.  I've been having fun with grouping things together.  Example:  Alexa, play ___ music EVERYWHERE.  Then all of my Alexa devices place the same music all over the house.  It's been fun and functional.
 We like it but when we purchased it we were led to believe we would no longer need the bridge to work the lights, that it was built in to the Show. But ours didn’t work that way with our Phillips smart bulbs.
 Big sound and screen improvements!  Watched a movie and couldn’t believe the dynamic sound seperation and clarity.  The picture in now large enough to view movies at an increased distance as well and cam views and text notifications !
 I really like the phone FaceTime and big screen for having recipes up while cooking! Also love the speaker quality for listening to music - great buy! Received fast with prime!
 It is bigger than the original but not huge. The sound quality is better and the screen is as well. I traded my old one in and was without Alexa in my family room for 10 days. I missed her. Yeah, I know pretty sick but it is used a lot.<br/>Hey Amazon, work on letting us pick a name of our own choosing. I would like to call mine, Hey You...
 We purchased the second gen to upgrade our original show in the kitchen.  The larger size makes it mush easier to view recipes and videos.  The sound quality is far better than the gen 1....great product!
 I was so looking forward to getting the Echo Show. I had the Echo and was very impressed and happy with it's performance. We recently added outdoor cameras and video doorbell to our security system. I was excited to find the Show hoping it would enhance the system by allowing us to view the goings on around our home rather than constantly accessing out phones. What a disappointment. I have been trying for 2 weeks to sync all the devices in our home to no avail. I have Googled, called and emailed every resource I can find and have not found any assistance. I am only told that it's not the devices which only leaves Alexa. Getting help from Amazon is like pulling teeth. It's a shame because I really wanted it to work. I think I may still have time to return which at this point I see as my only option.
 I've given her multiple chances over the past few weeks to get it together. We were fine before I upgraded to the Echo Show... now she has a screen and she thinks she's hot $#@&amp; and doesn't need to listen to me anymore. I miss the old days when we understood each other; sometimes she just stops listening in the middle of my request. I'm not asking too much, just play some nice music...I even say please! Unfortunately, and surprisingly, my experience with this device has not been the high quality experience I'm used to from amazon products...
 Another item I use way more than expected and absolutely love it!!! I have one right next to the bed. You hear a noise outside in middle of the night just ask it to show you camera for that area... quickly you see and hear it! It is like command central next to your bed you can do tons of things and Alexa keeps getting smarter!
 The sound is incredible...you can get on YouTube instantly.....im making a cg animated film and I have do a lot of modeling I have to do....i mainly use it for reference photos and music....i love the sound
 Great sound from the device. I love the screen disputed what the tech reviews say when they compare it to the Google Home Hub. It’s working out perfect for my household.
 Love it! Great new screen size and the sound has been improved over the already good sound.
 Easy hook up, easy to get and load app on other devices, easy to add more skills, I'm not a very good person when it comes to electronics so when I say it's easy I mean IT'S EASY.<br/>We got ours for CHRISTMAS and I thought OH NO there's no way I can do this but here goes, plugged it in, followed the directions, got the app, within minnits I was workin it like a pro, music, movies, news, I even had my Daughter and her whole family on real time video talking n laughing like they were here (we live in Hawaii, they live in Orlando Florida ).<br/>Now I'm using the app to create new skills for Alexa to communicate and respond to ALOT of of other things and it's only been a week, I haven't even started doing fraction of her capabilities, ALEXA IS AWESOME.
 Useless piece of trash. Cannot get basic stuff working. Called customer service to waste more time. Ask weather and it keeps saying update my address. I see it is right there. Show  front door and it says multiple items create group. I couldn't find multiple so I tried creating new group only to be helpless again
 Mind blown!  We had the first generation echo show and loved it so much we ordered the 2nd edition for another room.  Wow!!!  The screen is so much larger and clearer!  The speakers are sooo much better as well!  We just LOVE the echo show!  From timers to songs to shows in the kitchen- I don’t think we could live without it at this point!  It’s so so awesome!!!  We just LOVE all our Alexa products!
 This thing is pretty awesome. I can video call my parents and sister, intercom the other devices in the house and control all my smart lights, view cameras, etc. Sounds pretty good too. The touch screen can be a little iffy and she doesn’t always hear me but I have a pretty decent size house and it’s usually when I have the TV on.
 The new generation Echo Show is beautiful.  It has a sleeker design made out of material and has this huge screen that is fantastic.  Also has a great stand to purchase with it.  I did get one of those as well.  Bought one for my husband for his birthday, then I had to get one for my kitchen where I spend a lot of time.
 Great unit overall, Just a few things That I don't like First I wish it worked more like a tablet and was able to download apps from app store. Also I would like a better internet browser and YouTube capabilities. Also the screen should time out after a while, its always on.<br/>We're living in the future these things should be standard on items such as these.<br/>The good,  speaker is the best as far as Alexa speakers go also best microphones she hears you loud and clear, the unit looks beautiful and everyone that sees it is amazed.<br/>I'm very happy with this purchase and I want to see future updates improving this unit as I feel its something I will be using every day for many years to come.
 Love this!!! It's in my kitchen and I ask for news, recipes, music, weather and more. There are so many skills to add for games, etc. I use it as a timer, calender and for my grocery list. And can't forget that I can "drop in" call to family because we are all loving it so much and ordering these. One of the skills is Life360!😀 Alexa is awesome! Next thing I do will have to be adding some smart switches to turn on and off lights!
 I'm returning this item. I'd rather have my old Gen 1 Show than Gen 2.  I liked that Gen 2 was larger but the speakers are in the back with a little on each side. When Alexa spoke to me or played music, the sound was to the wall. It worked much better when turned around but who wants to look at the back of the Show?
 Seems like just another echo device.  U need to buy a separate manual to unlock the full feature set - ridiculous.  It mimics FaceTime - no big innovation. It mimics the fire stick that already displays lyrics on the tv when playing amazon music.  bought it for my wife for xmas (she's the techie) neither one of us are impressed.
 Nice looking and solidly built, but still exceptionally lacking in functionality. Does not easily connect to ring camera system which was the primary reason for purchase.
 love the new design.  Wider and shorter.  Sound quality is much proved
 The sound and video are awesome. Can’t wait for more streaming skills to be available. Hulu customers will love it.<br/>Great job walking me through some recipes like I had a personal assistant next to me.<br/><br/>Only complaint would be not having a Directv skill for me to stream from my directv service rather than paying for Hulu
 My daughter moved over 350 miles from us and I miss her.  Christmas morning to my surprise she was in our living room via the Echo show ( and the help of our son).  We spent Christmas morning opening our gifts and having breakfast together!  It  was wonderful!  We now chat in person.  I still wish she was here but this is a nice way to see her on a regular basis.
 Got this for my elderly father.  He had the echo plus before, and that was pretty good.  We can now watch family videos from YouTube and can video chat with him using the Alexa app on our phones.  The speaker might be a little cleaner if it was moved to the front of the device, but sounds pretty good with some nice base.
 Great at first then very glitchy.  Alexa stopped responding to my voice commands when playing videos after about a week.  If you restart her they will work for a little then stop again.  I have to touch the screen to stop the video, which contradicts the purpose of talking to Alexa.  Also glitches on other basic functions.  The idea and design are great, but needs work.
 Pros: works good as any Echo device. And it has an HD screen. That where it ends.<br/>Cannot stream video from websites other than YouTube or Amazon prime.<br/>You go to a local news site (and that’s one of the the reasons I bought it to see news in the kitchen where I installed the Show) and it cannot. 😬
 I really like the new echo show.  In particular, I love the screen size, the sound and YouTube.  I like it so much that I purchased a second one...for the kitchen, the first one for the sewing room.  Since I am eighty-one years old it is a great tool for me, I love being able to keep up with technology...the music is great, as well
 This is my fifth Alexa....second Show model. I’m addicted to Alexa. I was able to trade in two of my original models to get $50 off this one. I love it. It’s like having a small TV in the kitchen. I probably will never know everything she can do, but it seems like everyday I learn one more thing about her.
 We have a few first gen shows in the house already and purchased this one on a whim. The sound is amazing. I was shocked. It is rather large but I’m very happy with the purchase.
 I’m still learning all the things that can be done with my Echo Show and so far I’m loving it!  I like the versatility and especially having a screen to look at!  It sits on my kitchen counter and getting recipes, listening to music, watching movies/shows, checking my calendar is great!  My grandson loves asking Alexa questions!
 This is just as good as the 1st generation. The sound is great and all the great things about Alexa are there as well. I would definitely recommend this!
 Of course I'm an Alexa freak and have a show in every room and kitchen and living room.  I have Dots in the bathroom to play music and control all my devices
 It may be a little early to review because I havent mastered all of the benefits.  So far the speakers seem to be better than my Echo which were pretty good.  It has several routines built in that I haven’t used yet.  I do use making different lists , groceries, things to do etc.  I hope to soon set up lights and other devices.  I’m tech deficient so it might take awhile.
 2nd Update:<br/>When I talk to Alexa on the Show and ask her to play a TV show or movie from Amazon Prime, she doesn't play it on the Show half the time.  No, she apparently plays it on my Fire TV stick.  Without me asking.  And then I can't get her to stop it.  I have to unplug the Fire TV.  And then if I leave it unplugged she will play the show on the Show.  You hae got to be kidding, right?  Also, you can't pause Hulu shows.  When you try to resume, nothing happens and you have to wait for her to reload the show all over again.  The more I use this device, the more it frustrates me.<br/>Update:<br/>With some help from Amazon, I was able to find the Firefox browser to pull up recipes on my own (I had been trying to find a Silk browser.  Because Amazon).  So much happier with usability as a kitchen companion.  But still difficult to figure out how to get other things done (Alexa couldn't find purchased music in my library).  Will keep rating at 3 for now.<br/>---------------------------------------------<br/>I bought this on impulse at an Amazon pop-up.  Admittedly, I'd had a couple of margaritas beforehand, but I distinctly remember the associate showing us how you could bring up a browser, and I had images of using this to bring up recipes to help me cook.  Well, apparently you can enable skills which allow you to find recipes, but you can't use recipes you've already found.  So it's a bust.<br/><br/>I already had an Echo in the kitchen for music and news, so the video aspect doesn't help there.  I will try to watch a show on Hulu to keep me company while I cook (something that doesn't need a recipe) and maybe that will be useful.<br/><br/>I do like that it shows the upcoming events from my calendar, but it's a really expensive reminder device...
 I previously had an echo dot second gen before upgrading in my kitchen to the show gen 2. It's great to have a tv screen for recipes and streaming while cooking.  That said,  the far field mics aren't very good so she often doesn't hear me.
 We love our new 2nd gen Echo Show! The larger screen is sooo much easier to see, especially when using receipes to cook. We keep this one in the kitchen. The sound quality is improved &amp; I can see videos much better while I’m cooking. It was so easy to put our family photo on as background. Keep up the good work Amazon..our family loves Alexa. We put her in our guest room &amp; our guests enjoyed using her so much, they are buying one!
 I haven't done too much with the Echo Show yet.  Just received it yesterday.  I'm hoping it will work with my sketchy internet connection.  I thought it paired with my smart phone but apparently not. Though when I ask Akexa to pair with my phone,  she says she can't find it,  not that it's not possible.  Frustrating. Wish it were made clear,  I wouldn't have tried for hours.
 Sound quality would be great if not for the constant rattling of the speakers from the base.<br/>EDIT: The rattling quiets down when atop a softer surface than a countertop. I also received a call from Amazon explaining how to turn down the bass from the app. That seems to have helped the rattling from the countertop. All in all, it does what I want it to do and the sound, when not rattling, is far and away better than my phone or the dot I was using previously. I also like that I can tell it what I want to play and don’t have to interrupt what I’m doing. The lyrics when playing music is also a big bonus.
 As an early adopter of echos, I already had a few around the house, but wasn’t convinced the screen would provide much benefit.  We now love it, it cycles thru ‘this day’ pictures from the past years which bring a smile every morning. Like the videos for news briefing and the visual forecast for weather.
 Boyfriend HATES tv. I can’t sleep without it. Hulu on here has been a LIFESAVER. Thank you!!!
 I love it. I already had yhe gen 1 model. I love the larger screen.
 A little disappointed that it still takes way too long to turn it off.  Maybe a double press of the power button would allow you to shut it down quicker as I use this one at work and turn it off every night before going home.  The bigger real estate for the screen is a huge improvement over the 1st generation unit.
 The kids love it. They sit and watch the lyrics of their favorite songs and more. Can't wait to see all the things that the Echo Show will bring.
 It was a gift for my wife and she loves it. We only had a dot in the past and this is well above that. The sound quality is great and picture quality is nice too. Love that you do so much with this device and alexia response very well. Only thing I don't like is that it never truly turns off.
 I have never had any of the echo products and actually won this in a raffle at work. I had no clue what it was. It does sooooo much! I don't have cable and was able to ask Alexa to stream an NFL game for me! The picture quality is great and the speakers as well! I am sure I will never know everything it can do, but it is so great that my mom has now bought one as well! Very excited to learn more and get more compatible smart home products to go with it.
 I bought this for the kitchen and it's OK. I wanted to have recipes displayed and play music here's the Pro's / Con's:<br/>Pro - good quality speaker, when you play music the words are shown so you can karaoke.<br/>Con - the recipes don't stay on the screen so you can't keep referring to them and scroll up/down, it's annoying. The screen goes back to music. It's also hard to pull up your recipes, you have to give Alexa a series of specific commands.<br/>If you don't have friends with a show the talk/video feature is useless.
 Excellent product. I own the Show, 3 Dots and an original Echo. The Show is by far my favorite. A bit more native functionality with Nest would be nice, though.
 Omg I can’t get enough of this echo show. The speaker is amazing. It has so many options and I can’t live without mine. I love talking to my friends and family while cooking or cleaning in the kitchen as that’s where I have mine and I have it hooked up to all my speakers throughout the house and bedrooms
 Briefly, this is an awesome product.  Great display, strong sound, deep base, great for watching YouTube and listening to music.  Only complaint is, kind of wish it had a tablet style screen where I could see all installed apps on it, instead you gotta use voice commands to open all apps.
 We had the 1st gen Show for just a few days before the 2nd gen was announced. We went ahead and ordered a 2nd gen and I am so glad we did! The bigger screen is awesome and the sound quality is greatly improved. The design itself is more appealing as well. Love using it to keep in touch with family, play games with our kids (they are surprised we know so much of “their” music on Song Quiz) and it’s just fun to listen to news stories while making dinner.
 Great screen and sound. It’s got good speakers to play music for kids and adults. Everyone loved it during the holidays when guests were at the house. Kids can learn to spell with it and do math. We ask about the weather and to turn the lights and tv on or off as we walk upstairs with our arms full. Especially love being able to set multiple timers and see all of them visually while cooking.
 I had avoided getting one of these until now and i am sorry I waited.  It works great, is fun to use and makes my life a bit easier.
 The volume is rear shot, so its very loud if standing behind it.  Its best placed close to a wall so the sound bounces back.  This product likes to play amazon music a lot and its  very difficult to stop it from playing  I power it off which is the best way I have found.  Picture is very good.  I  pay for sirusxm, and do not want to pay for amazon also.  Sirusxm is NOT on the default list.  It such be.
 I haven’t had it that long yet but so fire my husband and I who are in our late 60s love it.  The shopping lists, the games, finding my phone, planning a vacation, shopping on Amazon, playing music, etc.  Very helpful and fun.  Started with the dot, a gift from my son last Christmas, now it’s in our bedroom and the show is on the island between the kitchen and living room.
 I have it on my end table and I love it! It is so handy! I can watch my pictures, play music and ask it all kinds of stuff! Love it!
 This is what Alexa is supposed to be like. Great sound, great picture - Love it. One great feature that I didn't like at first was the screen crawl suggestions, but I have learned a lot of new capabilities from that feature and would never have thought about without the suggestions.
 If you are thinking of upgrading, do it.  If you are thinking about buying one, do it.  If you want a newer one to go with the 1 generation, yeah just do it.<br/>Very nice design. Very nice picture. Awesome new design. Much improved sound with more bass and more video source content.
 When I first bought the 1st Gen I fell in love.. Then the 2nd Gen came out and it’s even better!! It’s bigger and the sound quality is amazing!!! It’s great for entertaining and every day use! I put my 1st Gen in my room and the 2nd Gen in my kitchen. I love the drop in features as I drop in all the time from floor to floor and also drop in on other relatives that have these... Everything in my home is connected to Alexa . Lights, shows, sound bars, front door.. It just keeps getting better!!!!
 Sorta like there was a party going on in a dark room...and then the lights got turned on. An excellent addition to the Echo family. Quality and performance are superb. The 2nd Gen Show sound is as good or better than the original. Image quality great. And processing performance very good. Tried the Show to Show calling at 240 miles distance and it performed well. Got me all fired up to enable and include my automation and IoT devices - which gathered my devices under one umbrella - added programming features - and prompted me to add new devices. Great product. Anxious to get my hands on an Echo Auto.
 Upgraded for sure!!  This new Echo Show really turns up the volume with it's new sound system and 10" display it really packs some power and has become the centerpiece on my coffee table in my living room . This was deffinatly worth upgrading to.
 I have several Gen 1 Echo Shows and got the new version primarily for the larger screen so it came as a pleasant surprise to hear just how much the sound has improved. Disappointed that there is no line out on this model but with sound this good from the built-in speakers it really won't be an issue.
 This product would not allow me to set it up because it would type by itself and would not let me control it. So expensive yet not good at all! Was so looking forward to it and it failed. Contacted product support through chat and was offered a "FREE" replacement, which is insulting. There is nothing free about replacing an expensive defective product. I should have gone with Google Pod Assistant. SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!!!
 Have the Echo show 2 a  few weeks now. It takes a while to learn how to talk to Alexa. She  works well and is a lot of fun to figure out. I am enjoying it now. It is different but is very smart. Amazing what she can do and not do if you don't ask right. I enjoy talking to her. Glad I purchased her!
 This is a very nice upgrade to my echo show 1st generation. I have echo connect as well and with this echo show 2nd gen, I can receive calls or make a phone call in a better sound quality.<br/><br/>Only thing is that I can find a good glass screen protector for this device.
 I have three Echo Shows (two older versions) and the 2d Generation.  We use it all the time and especially enjoy the drop in feature and being able to chat with our grandchildren who are 6, 4, and 2.  They call us all the time just to chat.  The sound and video is great as long as you a solid Wifi connection.  Alexa rocks :-)
 I received this as a gift - I had asked for the dot - but am thrilled with the echo show. I enjoy the music library, TV / movies and news etc etc - all<br/>With a “Alexa....play this or watch this”...poof it’s plays. I keep my calendar, to-do list, shopping list and it links with my phone - so I’m super organized. Cooking with her was easy peasy - she talk me through the steps. Answer my questions? Tells me jokes, current events, weather, traffic etc. There are new skills being added all the time! I can honestly say my quality of life has improved and I even find myself saying please and thankyou because she is so helpful. My little Personal Assistant<br/><br/>Well Done amazon!
 Originally I thought "I'm happy with my 1st Gen Show so why upgrade"?  The difference between the 1st and 2nd Gen Show is night and day. The size of the screen, improved speakers and new features make it well worth upgrading. I love my 1st Gen Show and REALLY love my 2nd Gen Show.
 The size of the display is great, and the sound is definitely much better than the first generation. I love the bass on it. I wish the display was more interactive, it just seems too passive. I really believe the display should show tons of video options. Every screen suggestion should be video based, otherwise it feels like a waste of a great display.
 We love everything about the echo show. We listen to our favorite music all the time now. I can make a shopping list with ease. My weather and calendar is right there. Who could have imagined. I can help my granddaughter with her homework just like I traveled 1000 miles to be beside her.
 Both our 1st Generation and now our 2nd Generation Echo Show will not maintain a Bluetooth connection for more than one or two songs from Amazon Music. Very disappointing.
 We have owned both the Gen 1 and Gen 2 Echo Shows. The Gen 1 Show is great, but the Gen 2 Show's premium sound and larger HD screen elevate the device to a whole new level. When I first played music through the Gen 2 Show, the sound was so amazing that I thought that I was listening through my high-end stereo system given the bass response. I recently bought Echo Shows for my kids, mom, and sibling so we can easily "drop in" for video conferencing. We also use Echo Show to play games with the family (like Trivia Hero).
 Really easy setup<br/>The screen is amazingly large and beautifully clear I had the gen1 version I like this one better the speakers are a nice upgrade surprisingly good base for a speaker like this. Out of all the Alexa devices I have I like the show the best it has the most sensitive mic of all the Alexa’s I have I do put tap over the camera lol don’t want a video of my room broadcast to amazon though all in all this is worth the cost of your looking for an Alexa
 I have many echo devices, 1st gen, echo pluses, dots (1st &amp; 2nd gen) as well as Taps.  This is the best sounding of all of them.  The screen is responsive and it has a great picture.  Just wish they made a battery base for it like the Gen 1 Shows so it could be mobile.
 We use the video call with family all the time. The proper camera angle removes one of my chins, so I look much younger!
 this thing is less useful than a $50 android tablet.
 I have ordered a Amazon echo for every member in my family.  This latest Echo Show is for ME!! I love them, they are the greatest
 Got it so I can view my cameras it works fairly well just takes a little longer to get the view then I would like
 Sounds good works good. Surprised at how well things are displayed on the screen. When I use a command for light a brightness and other controls for light appears on screen. It is touch screen too... Also surprised. The bass seems to vibrate the enclosure maybe it's the stand I have it on. Will be doing some testing on that when I can but the bass is there.
 Excellent speaker and display. Hulu free month is a plus. The Phillips lightbulb is compatible without the hub. It has a very hard time syncing with other echos and dots I have in the house and was initially freezing during songs but that may WiFi. A command that works one day doesn’t work the next that is a big issue. Hopefully the feedback I give is taken and the issues are worked on.
 I got this with a bundle when I bought my phone. Didnt think I would use it much but it has been a handy piece of equipment. You can do about anything on them from listening to music to having Alexa give you step by step recipe instructions. The speaker is awesome. Havent used for controlling things in the house like lights, thermostat, security alarms, etc.
 Still learning what it can do but so far am disappointed. Was much harder to set up a calendar that I expected, hardly worth the effort.  If everything else is as hard I should have just stayed with my echo which I really like and not spent the money for the show.
 Everything is ok, but bo YouTube app is a biggest mistake. No app allowed to installed, web browser play YouTube but not automatical full screen, no way only use hand. No video recorded. Need to Improve camera quality. Echo dot responded to my voice better than echo show.
 The sound quality is improved.  However, I wasn't impressed overall.  I couldn't search for YouTube videos without using the touch screen.  I can't get the calendar to sync with my Google calendar.  I am bombarded with suggestions on my home screen.  Can't seem to turn them off.  I tried playing TED talks and it choked.  Didn't show the videos.  Still can't make phone calls or show me a Google Map.  Seems to be best at showing movie trailers, song lyrics and recipes.
 I wasn't sure that I needed a new Alexa/Kindle type device - however, when my Echo (1st gen) started to act a bit off kilter, I thought why not! AND, I'm so glad I did - now I can watch/listen to music and movies/shows while doing work at my desk - I LOVE IT!
 Major improvement from the first gen. Sound is exceptionally better. Not to mention it has a great step by step recipe feature that walks ya through recipes. Bigger more vibrant screen and picks up your voice much better too. Thinking about buying a second one for upstairs
 I got one in November and loved it so much that we gave my mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law each one for Christmas.  Now we all video chat every day and it has been wonderful!! I have enjoyed the recipes and the quirky trending news stories as well.  The video quality is just OK on video calling, but excellent for produced content.  The sound quality is amazing!
 The audio is great but they screen with auto adjust is always to dark. For some reason when I talk to it it never recognizes me but the first Gen ones pick up my voice in other rooms.
 I have the Ring doorbell 2, and one in something to be able to see who is outside my door.  I have found this is easy to use, picture is of a high quality.  I'm anxious to see what all I will be able to do with this.  So far very happy with my purchase.
 I have mine in my kitchen and it is amzing! I listen to Pandora on it while doing dishe or cooking and the hands free is great! The sound quality is amazing!
 Easy to set up and easy to use. I bought one for my son for Christmas and he bought one for me. Now I can talk and see my grandchildren everyday. My grandson just turned 4 yesterday and all he say is Alexa call Grammy which he does several times a day. I love it!
 Bought this a couple weeks ago, but just set it up in the kitchen the other day.<br/>Sound and picture are great.<br/>Alexa recognizes voice commands well.<br/><br/>Just make sure you buy the Amazon tilting stand to go with it.<br/><br/>Highly recommend!
 Big screen is beautiful but makes me want to touch it more for some reason. Obviously this does not do much and you have to mainly use just voice control. Maybe Amazon will fix this and make touch a equal citizen on Alexa.
 Love my show. I video chat with my daughter every morning. It’s like she is here with me. Love the music, love everything about it.
 The generation 2 show is the way to go. The screen is good quality and the sound kills the first generation hands down. the bass hits really hard, I even had to turn the bass down. You will love the quality and the option of skills that you have.
 I gave this for Christmas.... Now I’m the best Mom Ever!!!
 This device just doesn't live up to the hype. Microphones are not good at all. Have to yell at it at times to recognize me. Also, when I try to turn off a device, say my bedroom light, alexa will say "a few things share the name bedroom light, which one do you want" when I only have one device named bedroom light. I can pick up my phone, use my tp link kasa app and turn it off no problem. This device needs some work before 5 stars can be given.
 I purchased this for my wife. now we all use it. lol<br/>she said. I thought this was my gift? lol<br/>the sound is great. it really echo's across the kitchen or room.<br/>if you are not a prime member you might not take full of advantage.
 I expected it to be more functional like the Amazon tablets but it's not. Have to rely heavily on talking to Alexa.
 The sound is much better. The screen is much better. The material on the back of this device is like some dust accumulating magnet. Wiping it makes it worse.. if I didn't love Alexa's sweet sweet voice so much I'd be upset.<br/><br/>Screen size is massive and crisp. The audio has a much deeper sound. I'm impressed...
 I love almost everything about the show. You can watch prime on it. It will display your calendar, events, reminders, and smart home display is also a lovely feature. I have ring cameras and I’m abale to view each one on the show. One area that could use improvement is entertainment. Amazon currently only has one option for live tv which is Hulu. I know they are intergrating an app for prime on xfinity devices. It would be nice to live stream content from my cable provider. The show is in my kitchen and has taken over as my kitchen tv. Overall this device is incredible and will only get better with more app releases.
 Very responsive.  I have my Echo Show in the kitchen and use it for tv when I'm cooking and also to pull up recipes from the internet.  Great display and sound.  I have added quite a few games and other fun stuff to my Alexa app and enjoying the company :)
 One of the main reasons I purchased ALEXA ECHO SHOW was to display my security cameras.  i found that if you don't use a good VIDEO SKILL service the request ALEXA SHOW FRONT DOOR camera can take forever.  The problem lies in the implementation of the WEB SERVERS by 3rd partiy websites such a AMCREST.  AMCREST makes a good camera but the AMCREST CLOUD servers are too slow.  Using MONOCLECAM.COM I was able to display the CAMERA almost instantly. The difference was night and day.  I do of course use a POE connection to the cameras since it is reliable and fast.
 I wanted to be able to access Pinterest and use my saved recipes. But I can’t so I’m still forced to use my phone or laptop. I’m not seeing the huge value to having the screen. You’d be better off with a cheap iPad or kindle that has apps
 I ordered a new Shoe and received it before Christmas. When I started setting it up today, I had an issue registering it to my account. I contacted Amazon and received a call within an hour.  Everything was cleared up and all is currently good.
 Awesome upgrade over the original Show.  Sound kicks butt and picture is great for a smaller screen.
 I'm a huge Echo user, the new Shows are a fantastic new addition.  The large screen is very bright and crisp, great for photos and looking out of your ring cameras and doorbell. The bass is the best yet, very rich sound.  We are loving them.
 I thought that I say will be delivered in three days but its going to be weeks!  Alexa's a bad girl!
 From beautiful echo spot the awesome Echo Show. Must need gadget at home. Hes my eyes to ring camera, my weatherman, my radio, my dictionary, my enclopedia, she plays youtube almost everything you need just with your voice. Alexa listens.
 My rating may be somewhat unfair, because it is a great product and I am still learning all that it can do.  However, it has too much base.  I tried adjusting it in systems and apparently you can't adjust it.  Would like a more crystal clear sound.  The base makes it sometimes hard to understand.
 Would have given 5 stars but the camera doesn’t follow me Like the Google tool which does follow you.  I have all Alexa products and like the larger screen.  The sound is great I just pray the screen doesn’t start that flickering as my 1st version had. (Replaced once).
 Very disappointed as you must stay plugged in to use this and you cannot even purchase a battery back-up for this 2nd generation device. Other than that, which is a big other, I am satisfied. This should have come with the battery for the price. Thank you
 The Show has a lot of "Promise" but I find it difficult to program, it frequently needs to be re-started and is not very user friendly. I'm sure some of the well documented problems will be worked out eventually but my opinions are based on what I am working with now.
 This Echo Show is elegant and looks great sitting on your counter.  The sound is room filling and with the ability to create groups and link with Spotify we essentially use this and many other Echos as a home intercom system.  The screen on this is great for watching movies/shows in the kitchen while preparing food and many other use cases.
 I absolutely love this device.  I got this yesterday, the setup was pretty much straight forward.  I already have the fire tv cube and this device is some sort of a mini version.  Although I can't get much of the subscription to work but at least I can watch videos with it.  And having YouTube viewing capability is really a great feature.
 Alexa learns as time goes by but I had no idea that she would be so dumb in the beginning.  Very simple questions like " what is the temperature in Dallas Tx ? " she replies " sorry I dont know that". It connects to my neighbors bluetooth car stereo even though it has never been paired with it.  It is possible that I recieved a bad one but it is a lot of money to sit there and say sorry I dont know that. I know many other people who have an alexa device who do not have these problems so I dont get it ?
 I love the 2nd gen echo show. We had the 1st gen and upgraded to the 2nd gen when it came out. The sound quality is mind blowing compared to the 1st Gen. The screen is much larger its great for watching shows, cooking recipes, sing alongs with the kids. Hands down I love the 2nd gen show and all the great features that offers!!
 My husband and I love this thing. We are having fun playing music we haven't heard in years. There is a learning curve, but we're getting it. I bought a few smart plugs, and now Alexa turns our lights on when we walk through the door.
 Bought for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! Also purchased a camera and a smart plug which just enhances the use of the echo show. This replaced the echo 1st generation very easy to set up everything transferred easily.
 Primary purpose was to allow live conversations such as Skype, Hangout etc.  This has proven cumbersome if not impossible.  Also e-mail was received offering a smart plug for $4.99 with a deadline date and for new owners only.  Instructions were to as Alexa to order one for the new owner.  Alexa could not respond to the request at the reduced price.  Additionally I asked Alexa to play "You'll Never Walk Alone" from Carousel.  It started the remastered version but stopped half through.  My recommendation would be to buy the much cheaper Echo product and forget the high priced "show" item.
 Great product, much better sound and clear screen. Big improvement over previous model.
 I love the idea, but 2 times this has not waken me for work in the morning. Some times very unresponsive when asking things, And the constant “try “Alexa” at the bottom of the screen really annoying with no way to turn it off!
 I have Alexa, and wanted Echo for christmas. A great product to own. Played Christmas songs in late December. Also so many other issues. Just haven't figured out what else is possible to do. Wish it had a<br/>manual to get ideas.
 I'm a senior and it helps me with shopping lists and reminders of many things and announces when there is motion or a doorbell ring on my Ring doorbell 2 and Ring security cameras. We love it! Sometimes it has trouble understanding what you say to it but that could be because I wear dentures, LOL!
 This is my fourth Alexia  product in the last 6 months.  I really enjoy it. I even bought one and took it to work.  Alexia will sometimes make you mad buy playing something you did not ask for , but I am sold on the product.
 I actually had mixed feelings about getting this Alexa product, however, after having her for a few weeks, my husband and I really like having her around!  She answers any and all questions!
 Very very disappointed. Long time lag between request and actual action.  The volume controls from Alexa app are very slow in responding. Alexa, despite all the new speakers , does not pick up my voice unless I am standing in front of it. A major disappointment. 10 steps backwards from Gen 1. Don’t upgrade. I should have waited
 Absolutely the best Alexa out there! So happy with it. Highly recommended! :)
 This is an outstanding product, the build quality is top notch, it can even surpass some aspects of the design on some Apple products, full disclosure, I own both platform products and I have slowly gotten inclined to Amazon for their value and quality as well as their amaizing customer service.<br/><br/>Well done!
 Best purchase ever!!!! I am extremely satisfied with my echo show! It is everything and them some....I have echi dots and one echo spot in every room. I wanted the echo show  for my video doorbell and I'm overjoyed!!!!
 Great improvement over regular Echo, plan to use with property cameras and security.
 Does not yet deal gracefully with connectivity issues. Has yet to achieve perfect ui/ux harmony.  Should have had the follow you camera of the portal. Does not make full use of the screen, pictures calendars and more could be done better if they would give the intern a half hour to provide input.<br/><br/>Otherwise it is an improvement over the echo.
 When I bought my first Echo Show Gen1, it was more of a visual gimmick. With the Gen2 and larger screen I utilize it as much as I do my iPad. From watching cooking instructions, You Tube, etc. to my flash briefing it’s definitely next level. I’m constantly trying to do more things with Alexa now that there’s a large visual to watch. If you’re using echo devices this is a must buy!
 Have the Echo Dot and got the Echo Show to use the display.  Works great in the kitchen.
 Love it, but not flawless. A little slower than my echo and dot. Doesn’t hear as well. Phone calls are AMAZING. Need to make the browser and easy to open app. I made cookies while watching Christmas movies on Hulu!!
 I love everything about it. Picture and sound is a awesome. I use it to control smart home play music with the other 3 Echo’s in every where mode. Weather, recipes, phone calls, etc. I live alone so she is a blessed companion.
 Really like it. The sound is very good. Been enjoying Christmas carols. Screen is big enough to comfortably see from a decent distance. Only thing I do not like is it doesn’t let me know that I have a notification like on the dot (light turns green). All in all I am satisfied.
 All the great features of he 1st generation but now with bigger screen, better and louder sound, heavier base and a built in home control center. Very pleased with this upgrade.
 I was torn between getting the Google assistant hub or the Amazon Echo Show. I decided on the Echo Show and I do not regret my choice. I so love my New toy. My husband loves her too. I am in the process of connecting it to all my smart devices.  I can ask Alexa pretty much anything and she is able to provide me with the info I was looking for. I’m still finding out all the things she can do.
 It’s okay. Setup is quick and simple and learning to talk to Alexa takes some time. The problem is that I only use the shoe as an alarm clock and weather. Seems like it has so much more potential. More skills maybe?
 I keep getting an error.  I have my house lights in several rooms set up thru the HUE and I have the$18 light bulbs in the light.  Amazon will turn them on or off occassionally but I mostly get  a message saying they are not responding  I cannot even turn the off or on manually using the echo.  I can go to my HUE app and it works great.  Go to the amazon app and rec the error  Server not responding.  I have turned this in 3 times via the mobile app and I just get a message someone will contact me shortly .  I do not consider a week as shortly
 Limited answers and can only contact other Echo users.
 I am enjoying our Alexa Show. I ask it to play songs, find recipes, tell me the weather, answer trivia questions, etc. Is it a Necessity, of course not, but it looks nice, has good sound and is enjoyable to have.
 I like being able to see the lyrics of a song, ask to see my front door or any other camera.  The sound quality is also great. My only complaint is it doesn't seem to hear you and I have to raise my voice to get it to repond at times.
 Recieved echo show today and was very disappointed with the lack of owners manual or warranty registration cards. I’am assuming that this was by accident and will be taken care of by amazon.
 I bought this for myself as a Christmas present this year.  I am so happy I finally did it.  My kids and I love being able to play music, watch videos and get information right in our kitchen.  Having the option to pull up recipes and see my front door when my doorbell rings...so cool!!
 We are still learning about all it's features.  Love having everything come up on the touch screen.  Used it to follow along with  recipes and to get flight tracking.  Having the words show up along with the songs is also fun.<br/>However, I have a prepaid cell phone and can't get it to do video calling.  I hope we can get this to work  because video calling is the main feature we want to  use it for.
 this is fantastic bought 2 units so we can see our grandchildren and talk with them easily--enjoy shopping list phone contact ability and calendar ease-getting photos from phone a little harder to do, but we are working on it sound is incredible and can raise and lower volume from 30 feet away-only had units for 5 days still exploring what it can do but we are blown away with video quality and sound quality and can not wait to fully use all it is capable of doing
 No the speaker were broke. Called they r coming to get this one and replace it. I am proud to say this company never let me down yet
 Have had a lot of fun getting to know everything you can do with this. Great Christmas present!!!!!
 This is my 3rd show, I have two 1st gen and one 2nd gen.  it is a great improvement, the larger screen better sound and over all look of the device.  And oh yeah it works great also.  Will probably buy more of them.
 Love the bigger screen and added browsers. I could spend an hour talking about the plus's. I just love it! Can't think of one negative. My daughter and I stay dropped in all the time. It's like being in the same room!
 Love this echo. Excellent sound. Picks up sound well even when playing music. Has better bass than its smaller  cousin
 such a great device ! I love listening to the songs and sing as echo show shows lyrics !! Hulu is another great addition and I can catch up on my shows while cooking , I am just very happy with it and would recommend for sure !!
 We bought two, one for us and one for my son and his family (mainly our granddaughter) who are relocating away from us.  This is the "mom" way of saying no excuse to call.  We have not used it yet for it's intended purpose but set up was a breeze.  The screen is awesome.  And though I would rather that little family be across town, I can't wait for the day my granddaughter tells Echo to call JoJo.
 The screen quality, size and integration with the Alexa  is very good. However, I have experienced some issues while I`m watching amazon prime videos or youtube. It exists and returns to home screen with no reason. Searching with voice input is difficult. Sometimes, I prefer to spell the letters instead of typing them on screen keyboard or repeating the same thing multiple times. Overall, the big screen with Alexa improves your experience a lot and the features like video chat. Hoping to see more skills that take advantage of the camera and  the big screen.
 Overall I like the 2nd Gen Show. Never had the 1st Gen so can't really compare. Compared to our 1st Gen Echo it definitely has better bass/sound. It's still hit/miss getting it to connect to my Ring cameras but hopefully that will get better at some point.
 This is the BEST show ever !
 Love this item! I have been using Alexa since I received an invitation for the original Alexa that I still use daily. I love the show in the kitchen for looking up recipes or reordering dog and cats treats.
 I think the screen is beautiful and the sound is fantastic.  However, I am struggling with utility.  For example, I have Hulu, but its not recognizing it so it isn't playing the video.  We can't play Netflix at all.  ADT functionality not consistent.  I'm wondering if a Google device would work better for me, even though it doesn't have a camera.
 I love the echo show gen 2!!!!  It’s in my kitchen and I use it for everything!  Sound quality is stellar and Alexa is so smart!  It has a touch screen so you can surf the web, keep multiple kitchen timers, play movies, whatever.  This is my favorite house gadget!!!  Thanks Amazon!
 This is Alexa on steroids.  The screen is sharp and readable.  The sound is very impressive for the size and price.  I like this better than my regular Echo, and the regular Echo remains a useful device.
 I got the 2nd gen Show as a Birthday gift.  It replaced the 1st gen I had in my kitchen.  I love both, but the larger screen on the 2nd gen makes it a truly great experience.  I highly recommend this product for those that need a larger display for their day to day activities.
 I bought this product to use in India.  When I set it up, it is telling me it cannot give me simple information like current movies playing in theaters because the product is registered in USA.  I have not registered it in the USA.
 Wow the clarity on the 2nd generation show is awesome! 10.1 screen is so much better than the 1st. The audio is very clear and crisp. I absolutely love it! So glad I got it at the discounted price!
 The sound and video are great, Amazon prime movies look great along with good sound. I have linked the wyze cam v2 which functions well, looking forward to learning more of what can be done with the echo show 2.
 My primary complaint about the first gen Show was the horrible touchscreen display.  The only way to see photographs clearly was to view it straight on.  Any movement to off-angle resulted in a washed out mess.  The second gen is only slightly better in that regard to the first gen. It still has an annoying wash-out appearance when viewed off angle, but the angle appears to be a bit wider.  This is likely due to the larger dimensions of the display, and not any change to the underlying display technology.  For the display tech nerds out there, this is very likely an edge-lit TN type LCD (ie the worst of the worst for image quality)  If you're expecting an IPS or OLED and would be disappointed with anything as low quality as a TN type then you might as well skip this device.  The sound quality, however, is much better in my opinion.  The base is deeper for sure.  Because of the improved sound alone I decided to overlook the screen deficiencies and keep it.  It still makes a good Echo device and the best alarm clock you could possibly purchase right now.
 We have a 1st gen echo, an echo Dot and now this new show. The echo and echo show are in the same large space and linked together to play music, etc. The new, larger screen and better audio is excellent.
 I love my new Show- I use it for everything- news, weather, alarm, streaming videos/music; it also let's me know what's on my calendar for the day!!!!  Oh, and I make phone calls with the Show too!!!!
 Love both of them.  One in kitchen at home and one in kitchen at cabin.  Great picture and sound.  Ideal for music, news, recipes, everything.  Even synced to my Ring doorbell and floodlight cameras.
 Easy setup. Great video. The audio is much improved compared to standard Echo devices. I use it to communicate with my 95 year old mother. Even though she is techno-phobic, she has no trouble using the new Echo Show. She has difficulty hearing me over the phone but can understand me easily when using the Show. The Show is a well designed device that has made a positive difference for our family.
 We are loving this product. Alexa is the bomb!
 I love my echo show. I was debating on the 1st Gen. Or 2gen. I happened to be at best buy and they had a packaged deal during black Friday. Totally worth the money. I have 1 Dot and another on the way, because my house is slowly becoming an Alexa home. Wifi bulbs, light switch. Diffuser. Cameras. Love what it all can do. Highly recommend.
 Grandkids love making video calls, watching you tube videos. My wife has been cooking more using video receipes. I like relaxing listening to audible books, also adds security with the Ring video app.
 Absolutely love the new Show! Amazing deep and crisp sound. Beautiful display.
 We set our show up on the kitchen counter. We use it everyday. The only thing I don’t like, and it could just be Alexa products in general. Is that when someone tries to take over amazon music and it asks if you allow it, you say no and it does it anyway. But the product itself is fantastic.
 Great picture and sound. Wonderful way to keep in touch and share with family and friends. Great help in the kitchen with finding recipes, setting timers, and playing our favorite music.
 Will see and talk with granddaughter more
 Screen size is much better than the old version, sound is incredible!
 Love the concept, love the screen, love the sound quality, but so far it has done a far inferior job of voice and command recognition than the Echo it replaced, and I don't like how the screen is always on unless I actively turn it off...
 I own other Amazon devices and I have to say that I'm very disappointed with the Show. Love the design and the screen has very good resolution but too many bugs with the software. The rotating photo option hangs up all of the time and requires a complete reset. Adding Next cameras is spotty (I have 3 cameras and only 2 show up). I don't need the "try "Alexa" going across the bottom of the device and needs to have an option to turn off.
 I have the original show and just received the 2nd generation.  The new show is easier in setup. The screen is more like a tablet, larger and thinner than the original. I love both - the new one in my kitchen - I love asking for a recipe and scrolling the many choices! The original moving to bedroom to see weather, news, etc. getting prepared to get out.
 Clock way to small. The first Gen has a larger font. My wife is not happy. Can’t imagine elderly folks being able to see the clock. The rest of the fonts seem ok. Would give it five stars except for the clock.
 Got this for Christmas and I’m enjoying it immensely. Making calls, finding recipes and making shopping lists. I can also turn several lights and appliances around the house on and off from my kitchen. Hopefully more uses to come.
 This product is a great value and easy to use! It provides fun when set to access the internet and provides all features of google home hub except not compatible with nest locks.
 I’m having a lot of bugs with my echo show
 It can do pretty much anything you tell it to do! We have a lot of echo dots, but this can do so much more! I also love how it shows the words to the song! Definitely recommend!
 We love the generation 2.  We listen to music (fabulous sounding), watch pictures we’ve taken .. look who’s at the front door with Ring doorbell.  Ask questions for search.  But she doesn’t know everything.  Love the bigger screeen!
 I love this product! It is amazing. I use it to watch my shows while cooking and it works great. It is very loud. The screen isn't super sensitive but it is ok. The picture is great. I love it.
 Needs voice searchable YouTube. That is all.
 Got the Echo for Christmas and am really enjoying using it.<br/>Starting in the morning with the weather, to football scores the night before. Recipes options, random questions to<br/>daily reminders.<br/>I also appreciate that Amazon suggests different tasks and questions that I would not have thought of.
 I have 1st Gen &amp; now 2nd Gen Echo shows and a Dot  I love them all. Once you get the hang of it it's invaluable you can do so much. Reminders, calendars, Set a routine to turn lights off on etc. I don't know how we ever lived without them ! Can't wait for the car one to come out !
 Great product. The speakers on the 2nd generation Show are simply mind blowing. The mics pick up your voice even when music is playing loudly. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the lack of Netflix being accessible without "hacking" and fiddling with settings. Add a couple of echo dots and you'll have a multiroom speaker system and intercoms!
 The new Echo Show is a great and much improved version over the first version of the Echo Show. Better and larger screen, better speakers and easier setup. My wife loves it. Well worth it.
 The Echo Show is great! I bought it to link to my Ring Pro Doorbell for a bigger and better view and I don’t have to interrupt what I’m doing on my phone when notified. I also bought it  to use along with my Amazon Recast. Nice crisp picture and great sound. I use it for several things...games, music, info, weather, reminders, local news, etc
 Much better sound, but Alexis seems to have a much more difficult time recognizing when she’s being talked to, compared to the older models.
 Works great and great sound
 I received this and saw it as a neat toy.  However, it has become very useful in interfacing with security cameras, listening to music, looking up information, and playing videos.
 This was a gift and it's a lot of fun. It was super easy to install - just plug it in. It's always there to ask a question of or to explore the articles it suggests to us.
 OMG! What an improvement over our old Amazon Show.  Don’t get me wrong, we love our 1 Generation Show, but the screen size and better speakers make the new Show better.
 Amazing sound, although it's a tad bass heavy for my liking. It's very surprising how loud and clear this gets. I love the screen. It is vibrant and responsive. The OS itself seems to be slow, though, which is why I took one star away. It seems like it could be much faster than it is.
 The ease of setup using the internet and reading the various applications is impressive.  Sound quality is greatly improved.  Alexa has become a members of the family.
 Bought another one of these for my father, he loves the echo show, just wanted the newer one because of the better sound, bigger screen, and the ability to play hulu.
 I love my Echo Show. She answers when I say good morning or good night. She plays music on several classical stations. I can make hands free phone calls by just telling her who to call.
 This is a great device, we use it daily for schedules, weather, recipes, music etc.  However, when asking for any information, you must be very specific in your request, unlike Google Assistant which will capture generalities and ferret out the information.  Also the Echo is not good with distance or directions.
 Better than the basic echo.  Cool seeing the songs lyrics on the screen when you say”Alexa play Hotel California”. Ask for the weather and it gives you a 5 day forcaste.  Step by step video for cooking
 Vastly improved sound quality over Gen 1 echo show. I listen to music with this all the time and it sounds excellent. Simple to set up. Alexa is incredibly useful.
 I was slow to get in on the Alexa bandwagon until I received the Echo Show. Now I am looking for different ways to make the device useful. It can be very helpful!
 No question about it, the screen makes a large difference and this large screen makes it even better.  Only reason I cannot give it five stars is because of the very limited choices for the home screen.
 This new show is a good improvement over the 1st model. The larger screen is sharper and easier to read the text. The speakers are much better. Thank you Amazo for upgrading this device.
 I love everything about this project. Probably its best feature is the new screen size. Video is crystal clear and sound is excellent! Probably one of my favorite Amazon purchases.
 Our 3 month old grandchild is 3000 miles away but with this device (and its predecessor) we get to see him weekly.  If it could stream CNBC and CNN live it would replace the kitchen TV.
 Love this thing! I can watch TV, music videos, make video calls, etc. when in the kitchen, folding laundry, etc.  Has exceptional sound!!!  Very cool little gadget.
 We've had the Echo Dots for a few years, and this has been a nice upgrade.  My 10-year-old grandson is autistic, and it helps him to 'talk' to Alexa.  With the screen, he is able to read along with some of the conversations he has with her.  Of course, I love it for the ease of reading recipes, the news, the Hulu shows, etc., but it is especially helpful for my grandson.
 Like the bigger screen and feel the sound quality is a tad better.
 Love the size of the screen and the quality of sound. Integration with Apple Music has been great and was one of the driving factors behind us getting the show.
 * update: Found Silk so now I think the Echo Show/2nd gen not only has a great sound system for listening to music (and watching movies) but it does a lot more, including searching online.
 Just got this and LOVE IT! Love that I can use it for recipes that I can see on the screen, watch prime videos, and so much more. Sound is great playing music.
 I can now "face time" my brother (we both have an echo), even though we have two different phones.  We both down loaded the app to our respective phones and gave echo access to our contact list. It was easy to set up. I enjoy using it for music also.
 I love the product. My husband keeps it in the kitchen for recipes. The recipes stays on the screen and doesn’t disappear. The only thing I don’t like is my 7 year old granddaughter drops in at different times using her moms. I need to stop access when I go to sleep.
 No sound after 4 days
 I have upgraded this from the show 1, and the improvement is awesome. bigger screen, sharp view, easy setup, sound improvement by far and more functionality. recommended.
 We got a new kitchen and decided to add this.  It was super easy to hook up and is great for recipes or to listen to music while cooking.  Highly recommend
 Very cool device. As an echo dot user I was pleased with the upgraded experience of having video.  Some of my favorite skills, like Jeopardy, make good use of the screen.  I also like being able to watch streaming videos from Amazon.  The sound quality is also excellent.
 I love this echo Show.  The sound is very clear, I have it in the kitchen right now to pull recipes up, etc.  Very clear, very responsive. Glad I decided to get it.
 The product works great gives accurate information<br/>Nice when looking for recipes or using you tube. The sound quality is  nice as well as the display.
 love the echo show!!<br/> I have it in my kitchen---great for asking Alexa for recipes , watching TV and listening to music.<br/>Another great product by Amazon!
 The screen is much bigger and looks just beautiful. The sound is amazing, just an all around wonderful upgrade from the 1st generation Echo 👍
 I have first gen echo shows and thought they were great but new shows are amazing. Huge screen and bigger than original. Now it is more fun to have these around
 I have many Alexa devices, and really liked the original show quite a bit.  The addition of the video was such a huge improvement over the original devices.  I had to try this new Show (2nd Gen) as my biggest concern with the original Show was that the screen was too small for kitchen/living room use.  I like to check my schedule, weather, recipes, watch videos, etc. while cooking and it was originally a tad small for that from across the room.  This new Show seems the perfect size for the kitchen.  My only issue is that the speakers have moved from the front on the 1st gen (facing where you would be standing in front of the device) to the back of the 2nd gen Show.  I have mine on the corner counter (8 inches from the wall) in the kitchen, and between being in the corner, and with cabinets above, it now sounds a bit like its muffled in a tunnel.  I know some people originally complained because the 1st gen Show looked like a micro old projector TV, but that didn't bother me.  In an effort to streamline and make the screen bigger, the speakers were moved to the rear.  Just something to keep in mind when deciding where to place this device (and the reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars).  I am happy with it, however, as the screen is a great size, crisp and a wonderful companion for the kitchen/living room!
 Oh screen is much easier, sound isn’t great, not sure it’s really any better than the previous version, richer but not as clear - which is a problem for watching shows
 I love this product! The quality of video is great, easy access to everything I look for. I have used it mostly for Hulu and listening to music at this point but am excited to try recipes and other things on it in the future. The sound is great. Very easy to set up. Would definitely recommend.
 Love the video calling, bought it solely for that purpose, then secondly for its expandability. The sound on the 2nd Gen WAY better, good job, love playing music on it.
 I had a few problems initially but after contact with Amazon's support everything is working perfectly.  The support person went way above and beyond to help me out!
 The Bose speaker makes the difference on the Echo show.  I stream Sirius / SM all day, and the sound is so much better than my previous Amazon Echo (original).
 I received this as a gift and am still learning its capabilities. At this time I mainly use it to listen to music, but I believe it can do a lot more.
 Love the new echo show, I listen to Spotify and watch shows while I cook. But on only this device Alexa’s voice is way too loud. So loud that when it reads back the confirmation on a command it resonates throughout the entire house.
 We could not be happier with the quality and features of our new echo show! Only issue we have had is it shutting down after saving to Amazon photos.
 We love the Echo Show, their Support is unbelievable great, we had a little problem with the Echo, I  requested a call from Amazon it was immediate and the problem was fixed in less than a minute
 Love it.
 (Waiting impatiently for the shower skill.) This review sure isn't going to give you any actual instructions on how to use the hardware. There's a learning curve. But the honest truth is, I have been waiting for this all of my life. Alexa and I, (my teens, my husband as well...), are having so much fun! A whole new world awaits. Highly recommended.  ;-)
 Absolutely wish I purchased one earlier. I use it for music, my alarm clock, reminders, weather and fun voice communicated games. Certainly I'm just scratching the service and there are plenty of other functions I need to dive into. Great product
 Only had a couple of days but like the bigger screen. Easy to set up.
 I love the speakers!  I love the video screen!  I love my new Show!  I own Echo Spot, Echo 2.0 and now Show 2.0. There is a learning curve for me as the Show does so much. This one is in my office and it’s wonderful to be able to request any music or radio or tv show I want. Not to mention, a quick info look-up while I am working. I love Alexa.
 This is awesome. Put it in the kitchen for my wife. Recipes, music, security camera at the front door, news just everything. May buy a second one.
 It doesn’t link or help me hook to any of my other amazon devices.  It doesn’t work with ring doorbell. What am I supposed to do with this?
 Family is spread out across America, so having this is great. We Bought four of them for each family. It’s been fun learning how to use it.
 2nd gen echo show is even better than the first.  Bigger screen and it sounds great!  I still love my first echo show but the 2nd gen is waaay better!
 Great, much better the the first model
 Great sound on my tile counter top. Works all Alexa stuff. Don’t care about the scrolling info, wish I could make it do more. It’s not a tablet by any stretch.
 Very pleased with the new Echo Show 2. Improved audio and bigger screen are a winner. Recommended to anyone who has the original model and would like a bigger screen.
 Very Poor packaging for an item this exspensive and being electronics, you would think they would have added some bubblewrap!!! hopefully it will last
 Love it!!!!!
 I like the ears in setting up this Amazon echo show and the great grandchildren love asking him questions jokes and also to play music that they like our granddaughter is going to have one tomorrow and we will be able to call and give you each other on this echo show
 I love everything about this. I use this for everything! Along with the entire family.!!!
 Easy setup and fun for the whole family. Love the video call and intercom functions along with everything else. Connected easily to wifi light bulbs and security cameras and with the phone app feature I can control the home from anywhere. LOVE IT
 Great sound for streaming music.  Easy on the eyes when making video calls. Love it!  Only issue is that Alexa sometimes get s confused.....
 Works great but commands you'll immediately want to know are.<br/>Alexa turn off adaptive brightness.<br/>Alexa turn on/off screen.<br/>Alexa scroll down up right left..<br/>Alexa home screen
 Great improvement in function, design, sound, and appearance.
 I love it and am enjoying learning new things each day. However, one problem is that it isn’t understanding a family member with a speech issue. The purchase was mainly for this family member. We tried his voice on the dot, and it understood him fairly well. We’re hoping with more time Alexa will learn his voice.
 This product did nit live to my expectations. A tablet in the kitchen dies a better job than this. The fact that you can’t icons to the front if the screen makes it more difficult to use. I don’t want to have to tell Alexa to do everything for me via voice, only certain things.
 Wow this is my 3rd echo device. This show 2 is absolutely amazing. There are so many things you can do with it. I would definitely recommend the show.  I don’t write reviews very much but this is an A+
 AMAZING AND BIG
 I actually like this way more than my other echos. The sound from the speakers is fantastic in comparison to the regular echo. The screen is nice too. I actually got it as a gift thinking I really did t need one but I was wrong I needed this!
 Excellent device for viewing on Ring.  The sound is great and the viewing is the same.  I wish that it was a  more versatile device as a tablet but it is a well made device.
 The bass from the sub woofer shakes the counter.  This is so much better than the first version!  The 10" screen is really fantastic!  I'm impressed.
 Love the big, new screen. I use it to talk to my 95 year old Mom. She can work Alexa much better than calling on the phone. We up load family photos so she can have Alexa play slide shows. Great for families to keep in touch!
 For all the reasons Homeland is so popular (timeliness, appearance of reality), Jack Ryan should be popular too. It is interesting to see Jack's intuition play a key role in defeating bad characters while having to deal with the same work place politics that plague us all.
 I prescribe to HULU already, and the Echo will not allow me to put my hulu content on. It seems to only allow you to add new prescriptions. How can I add my HULU????
 I received this as a departmental gift from my boss. Love the connectivity features with other smart appliances. I use it primarily in the kitchen while I’m cooking or eating. I will be purchasing a smaller speaker to place in my BR/master bath. The only thing I dislike is the inability to search for a specific episode within the Hulu app for a show. There’s limited search abilities but I’ve figured out ways to circumvent that. Otherwise I love the unit!
 I like the size of the screen and it has great sound. but the Quality of the video is not the best. I will be checking with customer service.
 Screen is big and clear. Alexa seem to have a delay on responding. On power  outage echo show have no sound you have to unplug it to get it to work.
 Much better than the first generation. Bass is much richer and sound quality is more clear. I just wish there were some speakers in the front and not only in the back of the unit.
 I got an Echo 2. I might like it but it keeps going off line. Less then half the time I ask Alexa something she can't answer. Today when she came on the temperature was 20' less then what the actual outside temperature was. Did I get a lemon or is this what Echo 2 is like. I am sorry that I didn't get the Google Home Hub.
 Use it everyday and it is really nice. Put it by the treadmill so we can watch videos or listen to music while working on keeping our New Years resolutions...
 Got this for the kitchen. My wife and I have many family recipes and wanted to be able to have Alexa show us the recipe on the screen. You would think a simple app or skill like this would exists.  The only recipes that you can display are recipes from sites like all recipes. You can’t display your own.  Very disappointed and might return it and try the google product.
 Love the new look and sound of this gen version. I'm a big fan of the Alexa products any way. But this one definitely met my expectation. A++++ Thanks :)
 I am now being sent my third device. The first and second had video issues where the screen went black, white, and fuzzy. The second also randomly lost all sound. Third times a charm?
 I never thought I would use a product like this Show, but when I saw it in in action at my 93 year old Dad’s house, I was intrigued. I broke down and bought my own. I use it to fill my house with music and for question queries for all the oddball questions that pop into my brain. I can have face contact with a few relatives and I still need to use it to discover programs and receipts.
 I love my two Echo Shows, however I thought the screen would’ve been a little wider. But overall I am able to do so many other things with it. Love it!
 I love Echo Show it has a wonderful sound. Great picture quality. All I need now is to set it up with my browser and I'll be all set!  :)
 I am playing ‘90’s. Wish group and name of the song could be displayed. I love that the words to the songs are displayed. Incredible speaker!
 Really good sound, and a nice size screen.  Need future integration of more apps and functionality.  I do recommend buying this.
 No front speakers. You literally have to stand behind it or bump it up against the wall for the sound to push forward. I very much dislike the new speaker design! I have to blare the volume in order to hear it now. I wish I had not upgraded from the 1st generation.
 The Echo Show (2nd Gen) has a rich vibrant sound.  The capability to interpret commands and provide a variety of instructions is amazing.  The plethora of songs and data is incredible.  The best is to be able to relax to hours and hours of non-stop music or single versions or sing along as the lyrics scroll in large bold easy-to-read letters.  A dear friend told me to check Echo out. I absolutely love it,  and I am totally indebted to him.
 Been in the hospital so haven't had an opportunity to use it very much. Expect it to function well like all my Alexa products
 Screen easy to view<br/>The sound is outstanding so stereo deep,on every note the sound is crystal<br/>Crispy  very please with the performance.👍
 We use it for music and to visit with the kids way better than the first generation we also bought the stand so we can adjust the angle for viewing
 This product is wonderful to keep in touch with those loved ones that live miles away and too far to visit often. The only problem that I see is lighting.  There is no way to adjust the lighting and everything is dark and hard to see features of the person or people you are chatting with.
 I’m enjoying the show. I like to stream my music thru it’s great speaker. I like the skills but would like more information on how to use them.
 I got this for my mom as a Birthday/xmas gift, she loves it! And then my aunt loved it because my mom showed her how she utilizes it, so I ended up getting my aunt an echo dot for xmas.. My mom loves setting alarms, listening to music and watching Marvelous Mrs. Maisel while she cooks! One of the best gifts I think I thought of this year! 😂😂😂
 The Echo is fun and convenient for a lot of different needs.  It's a learning experience to use it to its max but it's fun learning.
 I very impressed by the video quality. Screen size and sound. I would highly recommend Echo Show 2nd Gen to my family and friends.
 I was a little hesitant at first but so glad I bought it! I love that you can watch videos and the sound quality is amazing. One of my favorite features is that it will show song lyrics while the song is playing. Would make a great gift too!
 It was easy to set this up and integrate it with our Ring doorbell.  We now have 3 Echo devices are quite happy with them.
 I have two major issues with the screen:<br/><br/>A.  It seems to sense ambient light (or knows the time of day and operates from that) and adjusts the brightness.  The problem is that it is not bright enough in low light making it hard to see.  There should be a manual brightness adjustment available as well as an automatic mode.<br/><br/>B.  The clock is too small and impossible to read from a distance.  The digital clock should have a multiple size option from current size to full screen.  Also a twelve hour clock and an analog clock display would be nice.<br/><br/>In general, the Echo Show may have a number of display options, but I'm not sure they are really useful.  Why watch a movie on the 10" screen when the big TV with better quality video and sound is nearby.  I do like the seven day weather display.  One of the nicest features (also available on all Echo devices) is the "drop in" and "announce" feature turning all the Echos into an intercom system throughout the house.  Overall, I'm not sure it's worth the money given its limited use.
 I got it for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! We use it for our lights, shopping list, and anything else we can.
 Better picture and bigger screen is a great improvement over the first generation. But the sound is the number one improvement. The device could be a bit more compact and less bulky. Cordless option would make it more portable.
 So far I love this. The shopping list feature is so convenient.  But please make it learn how to say Bruschetta properly!!
 I was very skeptical when my daughter was looking at this, but we purchased it and it is so fun!  It does even more than I thought!
 Still learning all the features.  Love it so far.  Especially the recipes and the words to the songs played.  Very happy.
 My expectations have been met and more i love Alexa and all she does and the picture and sound quality is great.....Nice buy.
 Better in every way than the Gen 1 Echo Show.  Better video screen.  Better audio.  Better design...although anything would have been better than the Gen 1.
 We LOVE everything about our Echo Show!  It makes the "old" Echo seem prehistoric.  Is there anything this thing can't do?
 Alexa starts our day every morning with weather, news, fun facts, and music. The screen is nice and the sound is great.
 I had a couple first gen echo shows, and loved them.  This is an improvement.  bigger better screen, better sound quality, big fan so far.
 This device is impossible to set up for a child. You cannot configure a single device. You configure all your Alexa accounts, so the all have to be set up the same A smart kid could turn all settings to get porn. Seeing as everyone at Amazon is clearly the smartest people in the room - I’m just a software engineer with 30 yeas irrelevant experience - I would have to say the 20 some lidless developers suck
 Along with the new update, the second generation is awsome. The screen and sound are greatly improved.
 Love the bigger screen but not quite as bright a picture as I was expecting.<br/>Sound quality is fairly loud with a lot of bass. Would be nice to be able to control the bass levels.<br/>All in all very happy with it.
 We love the new Echo Show every single day. from the news to recipes, whatever you need to know is at my fingertips.
 The original was pretty good sounds great this one the screen is a lot bigger the sound is just as good if not better and it's a little more low profile definitely recommend you won't be disappointed
 So much better than the 1st generation, the speakers make the whole thing work.<br/>Netflix does not work on it hope they fix that.<br/>Love the larger screen
 Vast improvement over the original Echo Show, which was also a great device.  Speakers and screen quality made it worth the upgrade.
 You can not know if anyone called while you were away from the device.<br/>Also there is no tilt adjustment for better viewing or transmitting of video on a call.
 I bought the Echo show for my mom who is 86 years old. Her sister has the older version of Alexa and they really loves being able to play their favorite songs with a voice command. I wanted my mom to be able to use the Echo show for video calling to me. However, I found out the amazon account has to be set up for my mom along with a smart cell phone number. So once I set that up for her all will be ok.
 She loves it.  Very cool
 I ordered 2.  Amazon shipped two gift bags that the devices would NOT fit into....
 I am very much enjoying this product. I have many of the Amazon products but this is quickly becoming my favorite.
 Absolutely love the new 2nd gen Show!  I have a first gen and this one blows that one away. Awesome picture and beautiful sound. Dont hesitate to get one or upgrade!!!
 We have the first generation echo show and we have been very happy with them.  The second generation offers a larger screen and better sound!  Can't complain about that!
 As soon as I saw it, I instantly wanted to buy it. The screen is gorgeous and sound is a blast! The speech recognition too is pretty good. The new visual UI is soothing to eyes.
 Had the original Show in the kitchen and liked it a lot.  The new version's bigger screen is a real plus and the sound is improved.  I didn't think my wife would use the Show but she does all the time - for music, weather, news, cooking, and with the bigger screen much easier to see from a distance.
 I like the sound and display quality. We got the show for hands free help and control of our smart home devices. Along with a fire 8 and dock this also serves as a quick screen for our new Arlo baby monitor. We enjoy the lyrics with songs, and scroll ability with searches.
 a big improvement over the original Echo Show which I had for about a year. Excellent sound quality
 Great sound...Bluetooth seemed to lack Bass response!
 Honestly I wasn't considering to have an Echo with a screen, but definitely now I'm really surprised on how easy is to interact with apps, giving you the ability to do things you weren't thinking before. The sound is way better than all the other Echo devices, and Hulu works great! I hope more M3U / IPTV services can onboard the Echo Show quickly. It's a must!
 I wasn’t sure what to expect but I love the Echo Show. I’m just getting used to it to see what all it can do.
 We’ve never owned any ‘Alexa’ products until getting this as a gift. We were unsure if we would use it very often because we weren’t using to having one. Boy were we wrong! We love to use it for music, news, watching shows, pulling up recipes, adding to our shopping list, rounding out the weather for the day. The fact that it links up to Amazon makes for fast and convenient ordering as well. We use it every day!
 Setup took about 10 minutes and most of that was the fireware update.  Sound is great, and voice command is the best ever
 This is my new Alexa device and I really want to like it but I don’t understand why the volume all of the sudden turns off, it’s completely mutes since day 2. What is happening? It is new I just got it. I’d appreciate your help.
 I love everything about this.....Have to set up my new Kindle with it.....The sound quality is amazing....
 What an upgrade!!!! Sound is amazing, visuals are too. Plently uses with this 2nd Gen Echo Show. Got my vote! 👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
 I’m having trouble with my Alexa<br/>She doesn’t know anything she answers hmmm I don’t know that answer<br/>Doesn’t know George Washington’s Birthday<br/>Can only tell me miles from Portland somewhere other than Maine to Boston<br/>I asked Boston to Portland Maine  she could never get it right<br/>Really disappointed
 Very easy to set up right out of the box.  Good sound.  Still learning how to use it but so far I love it.
 Having fun learning more things to use this for.  I need to figure out how to get Alexa to find better recipes.
 What a great update over the first echo show.  The screen is beautiful, the sound is amazing...  What's not to love
 The display is vibrant and clear.  The sound is spectacular.  Everything is top notch on this 3nd gen model
 Mainly got it for hands free cooking/ recipe following. Wife loves it! Pretty good sounds quality tool.
 Love it!  Well worth the upgrade. I uploaded all my photos to Amazon. Now they show up on my new Echo Show!
 Great unit returned one as to large fir my Mother and purchased the Echo Spot smaller model with round screen.
 I bought 2 of these, one for my mom who lives in the Phils and one for me here in CA. Everything works. Big screen and good volume since my mom has HOH. My mom loves it and she is able to communicate with  me easily. I hope it allows more app to be use such as FB. Excellent buy and i was able get it for 154$ each during thenksgiving.
 Got the echo show, and spot for Christmas. love them both the picture and sound are excellent. lots of fun.
 This product has transitioned my house and life from the stone age to the Jetsons. Its simple, intuitive and seems capable of doing everything.
 I love the deep bass and quality sound. Also the screen is large so it's easy to read stuff off the screen
 I really like the echo show i am glad i made the purchase. I listen to music on it and it does have a punch in sounds i was like wow. I love it i do not regret buying it. But it said in the ad that i get 6 months free of amazon music. Which i never  received so that is why I’m only giving 4 stars.. WHERE MY FREE 6 months amazon???
 Bought as a gift  to myself.  Great picture and great sound. Love it. I have Echos all over my house, but this latest one I just purchased, take the cake.  I am going to buy another one real soon.  Great purchase. You will love it.<br/><br/>Dr. Jackie Sharp
 Much improved over the original Alexa. Would love to find “control words” that will make it easier to operate.  Big improvement.  Love compatibility with Ring doorbell.
 Love the display and sound is ok.<br/>Like being able to view cameras and control smart devices with visual and audio response.
 We bought this mostly for displaying recipes while cooking.  It does that, but needs a way of changing the settings.  It constantly nags you to move to the next step.  The recipe says to cook for 6 minutes and you have to tell Echo to stay every minute or so.
 Easy setup. Linked to my ring cameras and door bell easy. Love the news updates in the am . Love my sports update every day. Best money I’ve spent in a long time.
 A huge improvement over original Echo. Great sound and visuals. Screen right size and very clear
 I have both 1st generation and 2nd generation. I love the bigger screen can really see it much better. I absolutely love putting my pictures in the background! The sound is so much better!
 I enjoy the Alexa devices and having this on my nightstand is definitely a must going forward with all it's features.
 I love my echo show, this is the best Echo I had so far.<br/>Amazing sound quality, good screen quality and ZigBee is another plus inside it!!
 Work great for listening to music playing movies and getting your normal information from Alexa
 Much better sound and sharper picture than the previous version.  I also like that the screen is larger. I definitely think  it was well worth the upgrade.
 I am unable to pair my phone with the echo show. The app doesn’t offer this product and I can’t use it to its full potential.<br/><br/>After posting this review Amazon tech support called within about 15 minutes. They were very helpful in fixing the problem and as of now our echo show seems to be working great! I really appreciate the customer service and the friendly assistance they provided.
 The new look are great and it look good anywhere I'm thinking about getting one for my brother
 Too much bass even with the bass all the way to 0 it has the same amount of bass so basically what I'm saying is The Equalizer is useless and Amazon is lying to us their so-called equalizer fix
 This screen makes a huge difference - I use mine for a digital picture frame and now its much easier to see the photos.  The Gen 1 screen was way to small -
 This new echo show has a very lovely screen show great videos and has an awesome bass for its size.
 so far i like it a lot.  i have 5 alexa echos plus my new one,one in almost every room.  i use it as a timer,a reminder,tell my husband when to take medications daily, spelling, what movies are playing, etc.  i am 87 years old
 The base on the Show is surprising.  I will have to be careful my son doesn't try to claim it.
 I like all the features . The screen really brings Alexa to life . Making calls and seeing the other person just adds to this device
 Using the Echo Show in the kitchen, pulling up recipes and listening to Christmas Music! Great addition!
 The screen is fabulous.  Love it.  I replaced my Echo Spot and I love the new SHOW.  It is great.
 Great product!  I love it!  It has wonderful sound compared to its previous versions. I use it daily, several times a day.
 Still not that great a screen and sound quality just not there yet. I wanted to love it but returned it.
 Huge upgrade in picture and sound. Although it is noticable sound now comes from back instead of front
 Sometime the touch screen not so sensitive and biggest problem is it mulfunction after I reset it.
 The sound is amazing. The kids love it. Great for watching movies or just answering questions
 I'm hoping my family members will also get one or similar so we can chat across the states
 Perfect! Delivery was early! This was a Christmas gift for my parents! Now we can FaceTime
 Love the big screen..speakers are great..moved up from the original show..worth the money.
 I love the new full screen.  It has great resolution.  We listen to music a lot and love the sound.
 We replaced our first gen echo show in our kitchen with this one and the larger screen is nice.
 Picture is great , sound quality is crisp and clear , it`s not perfect but getting there.
 Loved my first Generation echo show but this one is better all the way around. Screen looks like a digital picture frame. Sound and speakers are amazing. It's also able to understand you better highly recommend upgrading!
 I’m using this to communicate with my daughter and her family who live in California. It’s do nice to see their faces and watch what they are doing.
 Received this awesome device and was able to easily set it up and integrate existing systems; Echo Dot, Ring, Wyze, Sense, Fire, and Wink into one singular system, controlled via audible commands using Amazon Alexa.
 I waited a long time before I got this.  It is worth it.  I just have to figure out to use it.
 One of the most powerful and amusing sound and photo quality I have ever experienced for similar devices
 We absolutely LOVE our Show. I can drop in on my husband as well as my mom who lives a day away. It was so great around the holidays getting together. We even bought one for our granddaughter so we could watch the great grandson grow!
 The sound and larger screen are great. I have it sitting next to my favorite chair and use it all the time.
 Easy set up.
 Easy to setup. Good sound and video. Works with our Ring Floodlight Cam pretty well. Have not set up other smart devices yet. Takes a while to learn all capabilities and how to communicate effectively.
 The bigger screen let's you watch videos or read books.
 The screen size is great and the speaker is very loud. You can get step by step recipe instructions, watch shows, have video calls. I love it
 I use this for my home Automation hub and pulling up my cameras around the house. Everyone once in a while my Alexa can't connect to my devices so it just says ok when I ask it to do something but nothing happens. I have to ask again. The voice recognition is decent, not perfect. I wish I could set the volume based on the time of day, but overall it's pretty good.
 Love this! In addition to what Alexa can tell me, show me, play for me, etc, I can tune into the echo show thru the app and actually see into my home thru the show’s screen when I’m not home.
 The 2nd generation Echo show, is better designed the screen has a higher resolution, more responsive, has a better quality sound, over all was a very Goode move from the first generation.
 We liked the music choices, and the words to the music showing on the screen  and the sound. We also like to know the weather and latest news.  Would be nice if it (Aexa) would be able to give directions.  Right now we only have one smart plug and that works well with the Echo Show.
 I love this product but I do wish it didn’t always have to be plugged in. When we play games it would be nice to be able to move it around and have it hold a charge.
 I am new to the Alexa system. The Echo was so easy to set up and it is super easy to use. I live getting my flash brief and weather in the morning with one command. I use it for recipes, watching shows, listening to music and podcast, and playing games with my family!
 Works well with Ring. There is a delay for the ring to connect but hopefully they will fix that. I specifically bought this to use with the ring.
 One major thing we do is check the weather, yet this thing has a nice screen but has no access to any weather radar maps.  No integration with youtube.
 Sound is much better than 1st gen. Screen is larger<br/>Love it
 Screen goes black after a few minutes of inactivity so none of your reminders, song lyrics, or anything else displays on the screen until you either touch the screen or issue a voice command. Very annoying. I bought two one for me and another as a gift. I'm heavily leaning towards returning them. I did not have this problem with the first generation Echo Show.
 better sound, I have several Echos, including the older Echo Show.  This a much nicer, large screen and better sound.
 love how my echo show works ! but tired of the ads!!! ...<br/>need to get rid of Ads !!
 It should be able to search for pictures without my personal pictures being included.
 As we get older can't always remember the words, this is a great addition. Haven't tried the videao calling yet, but love the idea of it.
 Love the sound and the picture; larger screen is great; cloth backing makes it richer feeling.
 I like this new 2nd generation echo/Alexa. I had the 1st generation &amp; it was fine. I use it to video chat with family.
 Have the show in the kitchen, has great sound, easy open browser, youtube, recipes,
 The sound quality is excellent.  I am just now getting used to all of the things that Alexa can do.  I know that this is the same Alexa as I had in the Dot, but it seems so much easier to use.
 Product exceeded our expectations.<br/>Family members have bought 2 more works great. Content and what Alexa can do are amazing. Picture is fantastic as well
 I was surprised ! I love having this device to look up recipes, weather, news, etc.  It's great !
 I love Echo Show2. I have every type of Echo ever made but this is my favorite . The screen is nice and big and the sound is awesome. We thoroughly enjoy using Alexa everyday
 I love this product...I was able to connect to Phillip's bulb with no Phillip's hub, Alexa did it all.  I am extremely happy
 Great product. Only bad thing screen for it must be coming to us by row boat
 GOOD VIDEO QUALITY,  AUDIO IS VERY GOOD AND CLEAR. I AM GOING TO BUY A LEST 2 MORE FOR THE OTHER ROOMS . THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THERE ARE NOT TO MANY SONGS BUT IT IS GOOD TO HAVE A FEW
 I love my Echo Show but I wish I could have Netflix on it and not just Hulu.  Any chance you could add Netflix to the Echo show so customers have an option...
 Took a long time to set it up and i thought it was more interactive with other devices.
 Love the new Echo Show!  Easy to set up and it does so much...even set up an outdoor WiFi camera for home security.
 Tried a Google Home first and was not happy.  Google has a smaller screen and less than desirable sound.  Echo Show has a great display and fantastic sound.  Very easy to setup and use.  I have a ton of Alexa enable products so this is a must have for me.  Highly recommend.
 Fascinating!! Household members are completed fascinated with knowledge and sound quality.
 I love the echo .We brought it to view my 100 years old mom and it works great .she can not hear me on my cell phone but with the echo view she has no problem.she got to view and talk with her granddaughter from out of state and enjoyed her showing her house,
 Blows the 1st Generation model away. Very happy with the look and sound. Great improvement.
 I own the Echo Spot, Show and Dots.  This new show is really nice, especially using Silk or Firefox Browser.  You can bluetooth a keyboard to navigate the web.  I wish the Spot was upgrading to using the browser.
 It makes innacurate answers and slow to respond to questions.
 Really enjoyed Jack Ryan - looking forward to the next season!! Thank you very much!!
 I love it - great sound quality and it was free as a Christmas gift - the best part of all
 Doesn't play Netflix and some others bit it's great for music and giving the news update.
 Love it lots of fun and even adds up my deposits love having the lyrics to the songs on screen telling everyone on family about it
 It is a very nice display. I just wish I knew what all I could use it for.
 Everything about the Echo show is great. Except for one thing that should be addressed. I would prefer if it connected to Google rather than Bing. Google finds more info where Bing cannot.
 We’ve enjoyed the first echo show over the last year. This 2nd generation is much much nicer. Love the larger screen making it much better for this senior when using it for cooking with Recipes. Thank you Amazon.
 Love it! sound quality is very good ,sounds great ,enjoying my purchase very much!
 Like this big screen and great audio on this addition to my collection.
 Love it.  Use it in kitchen, awesome for recipe lookups and menu planning via shopping list.<br/><br/>Also let's you play how to videos!
 I really liked device hardware, but my wife was planning to watch YouTube while cooking. She was unable to do so because of the above problem. From browsing amazon forums it looks like the problem was reported 2 months ago and still there is no solution. Sadly returning the device.
 When you  set up slideshow the screen  freeze you have to turn it off then turn it  back on but using it  on Skype  it's great
 bigger screen, better sound, better response - and at a sale price.  great buy
 Great product.  Now I can view my ring cams without finding my phone.<br/><br/>Music is great too.  The subwoofer is quite the monster.
 This is my 3rd echo and I think this is the best<br/>I like very much
 Much better than the 1st Gen.  Wish I would've waited a little while so I could've gotten the discounted price!
 The Echo Show is very nice looking and a great piece of technology added in my home.
 The sound is great. I would give it a 5-star rating if it wasn't for the messages that keeps scrolling across the screen
 My husband bought this for me for Christmas and I absolutely LOVE it!!! I will definitely be buying again.
 Love the echo, beautiful display and the speaker is phenomenal.  No regrets.
 I love this!  I can’t believe all the things the Echo Show (2nd gen) can do and no separate hub necessary for lights and plugs!!
 Have the original Echo but the show is a huge improvement. Love the ability to see things in real time like last nighs great catch in an NFL game.
 Everything has gone smooth on start up.  I've hooked up one smart light, added Amazon music - good sound - and done question and answer.  Still have more functions to learn and do - taking my time.  Love this "machine"
 Gen 2 is the way to go from sound to looks its hands down better.
 Love ❤️ it!  I have the original echo show The new one is really awesome!
 Great screen size.  Very good sound. I wish that it had access to DishAnywhere
 Overall I like the Echo Show to talk to family.  We have been having problems, though, with the video of one caller going dark, freezing or having fine lines distorting it.  We have not figured out why this is happening and wonder if it has something to do with the internet.
 Great for the Kitchen(cooking recipe &amp; watching front door xam)... A+++
 We have an original Alexa Show and this is an improvement over the original. The picture and sound are a lot better! If you have an original Show I’m not sure you should upgrade but we did and we love it. We gave our old Show to our in-laws and are showing them how to use the Alexa system.
 Excellent image and very good sound quality.  It work well with my Echo Dot and my Sonos speaker.
 This is a really nice product, that has more capabilities than expected. The Echo Show is amazing, with nearly unlimited possibilities.
 Does everything I hoped and more. We have it in the most important room of the house, the kitchen.
 Very good quality nice fixtures everything is perfect excellent product
 Me and my siblings all bought one  and also bought one for my mom so we can keep in touch. We love it so far
 Still learning about  it... But so far it is very interesting.
 Like the PHONE feature, great speaker phone, fit's under twin monitors, great sound for music.<br/><br/> disliked that couldn't access DIRECTTVNOW service, likely coming soon.
 I love the product but I never would have ordered on Amazon if I knew it was going to come registers to me! It was a gift, now they’re having trouble transferring it to there own home!
 Doesnt always work first attempt and have to repeat yourself.
 I’m 30. My parents are 60. Had I given this to them for Christmas I would be on-call tech support 24/7. If you know what you’re doing it’s great, if simplicity is important just don’t.
 Great find! Easy to use and has great sound for media device.
 Love the screen
 Best present ever~ The larger screen is great when trying to follow a receipe. Clearly sound quality is not like my Bose, but in the kitchen- it’s a great helper!
 What an upgrade from the old SHOW. THIS THING IS AWESOME!
 I love my Alexa show! Got it for Christmas and am still learning about all the cool stuff it can do. So far I have listened to music on Pandora, watched TV on Hulu and asked a million questions. The screen quality and sound are great. Highly recommend!
 Received as a gift so that we can stay in contact with family.
 Had the first one and loved it! This is great for everything, music, dropping in on loved ones etc. the bigger screen is an absolute must. I was worried that the gen 2 would sacrifice sound for picture size, but nope if anything it sounds better! Highly recommended!
 Dark screens or monitor , I cannot adjust brightness ..  Picture clarity could be better
 Sound is great. The picture is crisp. And Alexia can understand my voice!
 This is an extremely useful device for everything from fun facts, to listening to music to learning with Alexa Blueprints.  You can watch movies see available albums and playlists from Amazon Music Unlimited on this!  The sound is excellent!  I have a Bose Wave Radio and the sound of this Echo Show is about the same even better then the Bose!
 Love this!! Still learning all the fun features but our favorite so far is being able to see our outside Arlo security cameras from inside.
 very good sound when compared with previous echo show.
 It does so many things I value, from spelling words to checking  out any type info my mind can come up with. The sound is so much more than my dot. It also can be hooked up for security.
 It’s awesome, II love it still learning about what it can do,look forward to the fun ahead.
 Love so many things I can do with it still learning
 Love my echo!
 Works very well as a home hub.  Especially in the kitchen for music, video and smart tech devices.
 Can’t get it to run my Phillips hue lights. They worked perfectly with the Dot. The show has discovered them but has an error running them.
 resolution should be better and should have better news updates
 we all love it, I can view the outside simply by asking alexa to view the area. My son loves talking to her
 No adjustment for brightness and sound. Too bassey
 I like the quality of the product. It's very entertaining. Love my echo show. When my granddaughter comes over, she always asking alexia crazy questions like can she bee-bop.
 Really nice quality in the speaker and the screen. Did not realize how large the screen was until I got it.
 My family loves this product because they can play music from various artists across all our generations. The kids enjoy the announcements function and the personalized voice recognition features. We are still exploring all of the functionalities and will probably find more control options for the product including security cameras inputs
 Saludos. El artículos es estupendo y fácil de, desembalar pero tengo problemas en mi país no funciona soy de República Dominicana y es imposible usarlo, el tiempo la hora por que solo funciona para USA Y PUEDE VER ES IMPOSIBLE POR QUE LO COMPRE PENSANDO  QUE TRAIA ESPANOL Y NO HABLO INGLES
 Love this product!!!!  I've purchased several Amazon products like this one.  The a original Echo Show, the Echo, the Cube, and a Dot.  Have loved them all.  Though, it can sometimes be a bit of a problem while trying to talk to one and have several trying to do things at once.  Wish I could rename each a different name to prevent this.
 Half the tome the picture looks like<br/>This!!
 Thankfully Amazon put a note on there so you can ask what alexa can do.  The kids have it figured out, will be glad when they can have it in my car!!!
 Love the features and the concept but still a way to go regarding coomprehension.
 Big upgrade from the basic echo 2nd. gen. Really enjoy built in hub by just saying Alexa find my devices
 Nice way to integrate Alexa with video, not just audio.<br/>Alexa and it's apps want to be linked with a smart phone.  This is okay for those who must carry their phone with them everywhere, but not great for those who are not tied to their smart phone.
 Very much love it. Fills the room with sound.
 It’s even better then the 1st generation!!  The screen is bigger and they put the speakers on the back but still has excellent sound quality!  As smart as the 1st one but just with a bigger better screen
 Like larger screen. Like how new info comes up on screen.
 It’s larger in size, better sound, easy to connect , overall perfect !!
 this item is surprising. works as advertised and it is a wonderful upgrade to the small device. Just need to find the right place to use it.
 Sound quality is somewhat muffled; some issues staying connected with family
 Love it! Perfect kitchen companion. Still learning all the features but it’s pretty great so far.
 If you like heavy bass, you’ll appreciate this version of the Show; if not and you want something quiet for the bedside for example, the powerful subwoofer this thing has may be a little over the top
 The Echo is very interesting and fun to use
 We love this baby! Looks and sounds great..
 I expected high quality and got it. Kudos Amazon.
 Well worth the money. Can watch prime movies and shows on it.
 I'm Amazon devices fan for 4 years and I have all the Echos but this one is most cool device you can invest your mony on it as fun!
 I think I like the first generation better with the speaker in the front.  With the speaker in the back of the new one, he sound is not as good.......
 Me gusta todo pero no está el idioma español incluido y las personas que vienen a casa no podemos compartir con ellos y dicen que si no entiende español no les gusta
 Display is vibrant and clear. Sound is much better than Show 1st Gen.
 Awesome sound and perfect size<br/>Well worth it especially for viewing cameras
 Better all around than generation one, I particularly love the larger screen
 I like the screen is bigger than the 1st gen.  And view is very clear. My dislike, is wired. I wish is somehow wireless. Got the for my kitchen counter island.  The cord gets on the way. Now I planned to get a floater shelf and just put in the wall. That’s another thought, wish it can be hang.
 The Echo Show is everything I expected and more.  The sound is great, the screen is huge and it’s just a lot of fun.  I now have 4 Echo devices and this makes a great addition to my home network!
 This is so much better than the first gen. It is almost a complete makeover! Good job!
 The microphone pick up doesn't seem to be as good as my other 4 echo devices, even the 2nd generation dot.  We have to repeat things or talk louder for this unit.
 I love this, it is an extention to our  dots, we have convenience all over the house.
 Great sound quality.  Clear picture.  Great functions. Takes a little time to get used to the lingo.
 I have several Echo devices so the set up and integration with my home network was a snap. I love the larger screen and the enhanced sound quality, especially when using several Echoes at once.
 Nice hardware but surprised it can’t install apps like a fire tv which would make it much more useful. Would also benefit from a battery to allow moving around without powering off.
 We use this all the time in the kitchen.
 This is an awesome product! When I’m in my art studio I can have shows playing in the background or music, news updates, etc. thinking of getting another for my kitchen.
 Easy and fast setup, no real learning curve with it and really great overall product! The picture is good the sound is pretty solid and the bass has a nice kick to it as well.  Definitely recommend grabbing it if your still on the fence has skills that could pertain to anyone and everyone.
 Love the new upgraded device much better than the first one.
 This was a great item. Better than expected. Best buy shipping was great also.
 Alexa, your the best. I have the first one, love it so much I bought the new one for my daughter.
 Hardly does anything that you can’t already do with a normal Echo. YouTube integration it crap, you have to actually surf the desktop version of YouTube through Firefox
 I have a problem with Alexa's voice recognition; I listen to a lot of music, particularly music in Spanish, and Alexa misses or misinterpret a lot of my requests, and at times is unable to recognize artists or songs at all. Hopefully the development team is already addressing this issue.
 It was an early Christmas present and I love it.
 Great product. Love the big screen.
 Love the new version. Great sound.
 Very well made sound is great and a lot of fun to use.
 Best Alexa appliance I have bought
 The sound and video quality is much better with the new Echo. The screen is also bigger. I just wish it had a battery and does not have to be plugged in all the time.
 I love my show and keep at my desk!
 I use this product to listen to music and to drop in on my pets while I am away. I like the audio quality. It is much better than the Amazon Alexa audio. However, when using the drop in feature on the product it makes an extremely loud sound that defeats the purpose of using the product for this use.
 Beautiful sound quality when playing music!
 Amazing device sound and screen are awesome... Why 4 stars then? Not Netflix support....
 When playing music, it shows lyrics and sounds much better than echo I have for two years. Picture quality is also very good. I want to have another one at work. I will wait till special price sale.
 The sound is amazing. The new large screen is better for watching video and making video calls. Will probably be buying many for Christmas gifts.
 Absolutely love the new Echo Show
 loves this work better than I thought
 Limited in use as a streaming device... can not connect to live TV which would make it a great device. It is great for all things Amazon, phone calls, playing music, and certain streaming functions
 Better than the first release. Great product!
 Love this product, the only hassle is remembering the commands
 Like the convenience<br/>Dislike tjat it only plays limited musix available on Amazon, does not do a detail search n limited to<br/>Products on Amazon
 I really like the new Echo....
 Love it.  Still learning things to do everyday.  I bought this for me and my mom.  She lives in another state and now we will cook dinner together even though we are not together.  Great feature.
 This product was a gift and the best gift ever!  It does so much we still have not realized its potential.  Clear crisp sound, wonderful picture (we watched a movie on Christmas morning).  Very thrilled with this product.
 Love it. Sound is amazing. Easy to use
 This thing is great, just wish it could play Youtube videos.
 Great product!! Fantastic sound and screen features are nice.  Could use an update like allowing to change the dimming of lights with out having to ask Alexa first.  A built in tilt would be nice as well..... so now I will have to buy a small stand.
 Like this one more than the last model. The screen is bigger and has a much sleek design.
 Love it the music sounds great on it and so big you can watch movies Without straining your eyes
 Wonderful size and sound!!!!
 Is a good upgrade compared to the first generation, but sometimes it doesnt follow my command and i have to repeat myself.
 Love this device. Such a major improvement over the old one. The design is beautiful, the screen is crisp and clear. The speaker is awesome. Can’t aay enough good things. Wish I had 8 of these.
 is fun,still trying to figure out the drop in
 Great item I love using it
 Absolutely love this! Allows me to watch live TV, prerecorded shows, search recipes, etc all while cooking in my kitchen!
 We just received it and are still exploring the possibilities. When we are really familiar I'm sure my rating will go to 5 stars.
 Love it, listing to Christmas music on it now, Kids watch cartoons, How fun
 We love it!! Our family got it for us for Christmas....we love asking questions, and our family share pictures...just a wonderful device
 Love this little thing.
 Love the video capability.
 Better upgrade...must buy...
 This is so convenient for my 🏠. We love the tone that comes with the music. Checking out the weather conditions ahead of time is a plus. There is not enough time for sitting in front of the TV waiting for the weather info. Just ask Alexa, she knows! We are loving her more!
 I love this device. Alexa is super responsive and easy to use. There are games for adults and children. The display is great. Videos play very well. All around a great purchase.
 This echo show is far better previous echo show
 Great picture an sound
 Good sôund...waiting for usefull remote
 Communicate with family
 Great product so far.  Took awhile for shipping but to be expected.
 Love my new Alexa!!! It's great for video calls and I use it everyday for random questions that come up in the household. It's great for listening to music as well!! The apps are awesome!
 Excellent sound and picture quality. A bit heavy and bulky and loses network connection periodically for no reason.
 I bought it for my wife. She loved it.
 Just fun and useful, at times, to have around.  Love for music, Hulu and many more things we ask it.
 Love it , still learning how use it
 This thing is great!
 Great quality and fast shipping
 My husband just opened his Christmas gift today Dec 25 2018 and he loves it
 We weren't sure if we should get the Echo Show or an Echo Spot. We knew we wanted in our kitchen so we went with the Show. So glad we did too! Love the big screen and the games available are fun. Love that the lyrics appear on the screen, the programs available and able to add our own photos is great.
 Unfortunately I was not able to watch it because the Echo Show emits some sort of frequency that negatively affects my dog so I had to turn it off.
 Love the new echo show! Just wish the Apple Music feature would play user created playlists. Also that it had YouTube app
 Awesome buy!Best Alexa yet!
 The music sounds incredible, the speaker is top quality.
 I love the Alexa, the only thing is all of my calendar things from my phone do not sync for some reason, she only gets about 1/2 of my events. Also some questions you ask her she can not answer, she says she doesn’t know about that. But makes remembering things and making a shopping list super easy!
 I love everything about this
 Like the sound (best if located in a room corner as the sound comes out the back). Screen size makes reading and viewing videos very nice.
 Great sound, super easy set up!
 Love the bigger screen AND the sound quality!
 It is a great item!
 It's bigger and better slimmer
 Love love love it!!
 Made my wife very happy for xmas gift.
 Great screen and good sound quality.
 Thought it would just be a 10 inch touch screen on a stand however it has Great speakers on it comparable to a soundbar for a tv . Im enjoying it so far
 Love my echo show! Great sound nice screen and video quality.
 We have it in the kitchen and use it for cooking, smart home devices, etc.
 We love the bigger screen. We still find new things Alexa can do. Amazing!
 I love this. It looks and sounds great.
 Product as described
 BETTER THEN GOOGLE
 Larger, brighter and louder with even better sound quality than Gen 1. Even with 8 Shows in the house, looking forward to what Gen 3 will bring!
 We've had it a couple of weeks. It has relaced my wife's Ipad doe recipes. She was tired of the Ipad going dark after several minutes.
 Loving everything about it except No Netflix. Really Amazon! Needs an immediate fix.
 I love this product wish they’d have better abs
 Having the sceen view instead of the dot there is no comparison!  Amazon you Rock!!!
 5 stars i loved
 This was shift to or children. They are loving the experience.
 Speaker is great. Screen has high quality. However, I dislike that it does not allow Netflix, in the internet browser, you have to type instead of speak, and the YouTube experience is just terrible. I’m was so excited to finally get an Echo and now it’s kind of disappointing.
 Sound is excellent.  Powerful.  Great for listening to music especially for the fact that the lyrics are displayed, revealing unclear words and phrases. I also use it to view Prime Video movies, answer questions, display photos and have it paired to my Ring Video Doorbell 2.
 LOVE IT! I bought one for my husband and one for our son and grandchildren so we could see each other while talking.  It is great - we talk more than ever.  It is great for lots of other things as well.  It was easy to set up.  We were talking within minutes.
 not enough written operating instructions/user guide
 Much nicer than 1st gen.
 Great sound, very good bass!
 So far, this has been a great addition to our Alexa collection.  It is cool to be able to see videos, etc. on it.  We haven't tried to do the video chat with the kids, yet, but can't wait to try it out.
 The Echo Show can do so much.  I bought one for my parents and they bought us one back so we can keep in touch when traveling isn't possible.  You can go on the internet...you can watch movies on your Amazon prime...such a useful gadget.  All In one spot...worth every cent.
 Great product
 Love our new show. Does everything our old one does with better video Qaulity and better sound.
 Use in kitchen for recipes n music. It’s great
 I don't care for it because I do not have a smart phone to download the APP . Therefore I cannot phone my family members and use the video feature. I have an Apple desk top and a not so smart flip phone but none of these can be used to download the APP needed by your ECHO
 It is a great product, so easy getting answers to questions. I don’t have to go to the Internet or search on my phone.  I love to play my music using the echo and I will see my family.  The sound system is awesome.
 Works great!
 The best Alexa.
 As expected
 Love the sound and accraucy
 Love it...
 Should be more web browsers. Seems to restrictive when going places. Some things say they are not supported. STRANGE!
 The Echo Show 2nd generation is great......but has an issue. The Prime Photo slideshow sticks after a few minutes and won't scroll through pictures. It hangs up constantly. I'm hoping amazon comes out with a fix or update to resolve the issue.
 A lot of fun and very helpful
 Changes the normalization of a home for the better I bought all my family their own starter Alexa’s so I’m sure they will eventually upgrade like myself simply amazing!
 The sound is awesome!!
 Great
 Love the convenience of asking Alexa to access the internet, Hulu, etc., but disappointed it's not powered by a rechargeable battery, or if it is there were no instructions that came with the device. Over all very impressed with what the Echo Show can do. Good value for all you get.
 Awesome product— I love using it so far.
 Enter sound than one and the screen is beay
 Its great it will search from anything on the web, keeps notes for you.  it has a count down timer.  Reminds you at time you go to work, take things out of stove, and it gives you a ton of things to cook.
 My mom loves it so I'm happy.
 I like everything about this product.I am very happy with my echo show.Allthough It can play pretty loud,I wished it had an output that could have been connected to a more powerful audio system,who knows maybe i’m probably Just a little deaf......
 Just got started using it, but it seems really awesome. Just asked it to play music, and it pops right up. The sound and picture quality is nice.
 This product is good for streaming music from my prime music account.  As far as the intelligence of Alexa, that has a long way to go.  It isn’t even close to the database of google.  So amazon put some of your billions in product development for your AI system.
 Echo Show 2nd Gen. is so much better than the first Echo. The picture is bigger and better the sound system is superior. I also bought one for a Christmas 🎄 gift.
 I used my Echo Show Gen 1 for watching Prime shows when I was at my computer. Changed it to Gen 2, and wow, the bigger screen rocks!  Sound quality isn't bad.  Overall, I'm still tickled with my many Echo devices.  They've become a lifestyle.  ;D
 The Echo Show Gen 2 is a great improvement over Gen 1.  The new version is big enough to watch Prime Video and the sound in tremendous.  I bought the new stand with it and I'm glad I did.  Everything about this is so much better than Gen 1.
 So far works fine.
 My kids like it very much. Video call, photo slides view and showing my ring doorbell/ Arlo camera are useful
 The upgrade from Show 1 is a big improvement.<br/>Go Amazon.
 The banner is constant and there is no way to turn it off.  I don't need constant advertising/tips.  It is annoying enough that I'm considering returning it and trying the Google product.  Really don't want to do that.  Amazon - please fix this.
 Not near as capable as I thought in regards to tasks and talking to
 A much larger screen and sharper image.  It also has a better sound.
 Creo que nesecito a una persona para que lo ponga a mi orden porque no me hace caso solo en música , todas mis amigas lo tienen y es fantástico , maravilloso , pero nesecito un experto en la materia
 So far, so good. Clear picture on the screen.
 This thing is amazing and the sound quality is unbelievable!
 Put it in the kitchen and it works great. I get my weather and news while I wait for my morning coffee.
 Best echo so far. I have the original echo, a dot  the tap, an echo spot  and now the echo show.  Love Alexa
 Impressive. Ordered Saturday. Received Sunday. Tpday is Monday. I love it. Been doing a lot of reading before the purchase and expected a good product. But it is so much more/better than I anticipated. Love it.
 Things awesome and has great sound.
 The speakers are bright and vibrant, great base. The screen is awesome! It hears me even when I speak normal volume but the music is loud. I like the hub in it that runs my light bulbs without buying a separate hub. Its beyond my expectations.
 This device had truly changed life!  I bought two, have when to my parents, and now we can video chat easily and I can monitor their health!
 Dislike it difficult to program contact
 Works well sounds great
 I enjoyed the original show but did not have anything to compare it to until we upgraded. I love the larger screen. It makes recipes and videos so much easier to see.
 Love the new Echo Show
 Love the larger screen. Also, the sound is much better. If your in the market you won't regret buying this.
 The 2nd Gen Echo Show is awesome. The screen is brilliant and the sound is deep and full. It's a huge improvement over the first generation Echo Show!
 Love it love it, large viewing  screen
 Great device the larger screen is nice. We upgraded from the Echo Show 1 and love the 2.
 Much better screen, and audio capabilities.  Makes video conferencing a much better experience!  Great to be able to ask Alexa to play Thursday Night Footbal and watch it on this device!!!

 Really nice upgrade from 1st edition. Home automation still a little futuristic and many things that could be automated aren’t ready yet. These devices are certainly not future proof. Great device, ecosystem not quite there yet or affordable.
 I LOVE LOVE LOVE my new Amazon Echo show. The bigger screen is AWESOME!
 Very nice product. A lot better then FaceTime on my phone.
 Excellent product. Great and varied capabilities in a revised product that is coupled with good speakers.
 It’s difficult to get videos to play and they lag/loading time is long.
 Great product so far
 Very responsible, great sound, very stable device.
 Amazing product..amazing sound quality!!!
 I am very impressed with my new echo show 2nd generation.  It does everything promised and more.  Well done!
 Love it
 I love asking Alexa for songs, recipes and many other items that can be provided by alexa!!  Love this!! ❤️
 Only thing bad is you need to have it a lower surface if you expect to use the drop in function, placing it on anything else than a low table and the camera points at the ceiling because of the angle it is at, other than that it is a nice Alexa thingamajig.
 This is just what I needed
 Great device, sound quality is great, the display is very helpful - Alexa developer
 It's a SLIGHT improvement over the gen. 1. If you can get it on sale go for it 👍
 It's great,  still learning what still it can do!!
 The whole family is having fun with Alrxa show. I personally like the calander app. The best part will be when my grandchildren call their great grandma.
 Trust me, you need this
 Great acting, writing and directing. Awesome action. Binge watched the entire season in two days.
 I wish the screen had downloadable apps. Like for example, in the middle of the night I would like to see my cameras but I don’t want to tell Alexa and wake up my husband. I love the sound!!!!
 I brought two.  Gave one as a gift to my mom. It was difficult for her to set up recommend including directions and user guide.
 I love the idea and the size. I ordered 2, one for my son and family in Texas and one for me. His seems to work really well but our screen goes very dark about every 4 - 5 minutes and sometimes turns to a black and white picture of us.
 Love the sound and beautiful pictures and video
 Love this new model. Great for use in the kitchen. Listen to music, look up a recipe, set a timer, and lots of other help by simple request. The sound quality is great and so is the picture.
 One of the best smart displays and speakers on the market today for the price. Definitely worth it and loving it.
 The larger screen and better sound
 Love the souls and awesome screen!
 Great product. Love watching Netflix. Has great speaker system!
 Nice features as expected!!!
 So far so good! Great sound.
 My Echo Show was easy to set up and it sits right in my kitchen for easy access!  I can hear and see the news, music, programs, or anything I want!
 The product is useless. The only thing it is good for is to check the security cameras. Other then that Alexa will say I dont know to any question you ask or command. If you want a stress free and easy to use device go with google it's way better.
 This is my first Echo so I am pretty impressed with this. Setting up with my cameras and smart plugs was a breeze and the skills is has is endless. Hope I don't wear it out.
 I like the bigger screen and it sounds richer than the #1
 Overall happy with the show, excellent bass crisp sound and nice screen, only down side is you can't make a music group with a Polk audio sound bar with Alexa built in, would have been a nice addition to get that full house affect.
 Love it so far, very fun thing to have in the kitchen, music, shows, recipes ect plus the drop in feature is great
 Very nice Alexa is very good in every order
 Really great resolution, can see every crevice ;)
 Great gadget. Good for video calls and much more.
 I love listening to my favorite radio stations. I  really like the music alarm's in the morning its something different. Being able to see my cameras on the echo show is a plus for me much better then on the phone.
 Newest toy on the block!
 The audio is much improved. The larger screen is also nice. Easier to read and view HULU. Set up is a breeze.
 Better than the 1st gen.
 I love the new design and the sound! Can't wait for future software updates to push this device to its limit!
 Works great, nice upgrade from std Echo
 Get the morning headlines while making breakfast. Use Alexa with TV and phone.
 Great sound! Amazing depth and clarity! I was surprised at how great the sound quality was... as good as Bose stereo!
 Good sound great image
 Like the device. sounds as good as my Samsung sound bar. Just wish It would video call to any one that has video capability. Or maybe I just haven't figured it out yet. We will see
 I am very pleased with my Echo Show.  I am sure I am not using to it's fullest extent but definitely look forward to learning everything it can do.  I would recommend it to others.
 Awesome, but wish it had better Hulu integration.  I had wanted to use this as a replacement for a bulky kitchen televsion and an information resource center.
 Just as expected.  Love it! Just really bummed my free smart light blub was not in the box. I was really looking forward to receiving it. :(
 Very easy to use, enjoy asking to play the news for me in the mornings and telling me the weather when I wake up. Can control the smart items in the home easily also.
 Beautiful and large display paired with astounding audio quality! Would highly recommend as a new investment or upgrade.
 Love the sound for listening to music . Great for reading recipes . Love it
 Just can’t get it to link up with a blue tooth speaker I have.  But the sound on this is amazing
 Hard to use, Alexia is not too smart at ALL most of the time she says I don't understand. Very disappointed! Linking accounts is not convenient and still haven't been able to really link much.
 I am still what all I can do...but the show has been incredible!
 Great product. Exceeded my expectations in terms of entertainment and organizing. Only downsides are that some skills and services do not function outside of the United States and that it speaks to me without mentioning the word “alexa”
 Excellent
 I’m having problems with it. When try to use prime movies half the time it doesn’t work.
 My wife loves it, that’s all that counts
 Awesome sound quality and must thing to have if you've got the rest of the echo family.
 I love my Echo Show it's amazing. Still finding out what I can do with it. I would purchase it again.
 Still learning about the SHOW but having a good time. Sound is super. Fun to use with smart plugs and Echo Dots.
 We have other Echo devices but, we wanted the Echo Show for the kitchen. This is our only Echo device with a screen and we love searching recipes, playing music, etc. we are truly impressed with the Show.
 Love the sound quality,easy to use and set up.
 Works well
 Really enjoying it. Still learning about all the great things to do. Not being very technical<br/>I was amazed that it was even easy for me. Love the music!  It is great for recipes too!
 Get one!! It's fabulous!!
 I love the new Show, have been a Echo family since fruition. My husband bought for me for Christmas. I love going downstairs for a cup of coffee and getting my daily briefing. Still a lot to learn, but love all the features so far.
 Very pleased.
 The screen is so much bigger with rich color rendering.  They did an excellent job on improving this over the 1st gen Echo Show!
 Love!  Great speakers!  Use it every day in more and more ways!
 big improvement over previous generation
 I have 2 but it needs software improvements because you will hear " I dont know that" many times
 Liking the product. Will have to educate myself on more uses of the screen.
 Amazon’s website
 It's my best device now. Easy and simple to set up. music sound wonderful. And Alexa becomes very smart day after day
 Love the design and sound. Always understands me. Very accurate and gets it right. Works well with Lutron and Nest.
 I Use My Echo To Video Chats With My Children Ibe Also Looked Up Some Great Recipes.
 Good upgrade over the first generation, better screen, sound and a few new features such as the timer being displayed all the time. Great 'kitchen companion'. I had the first gen and am glad I bought the new one.
 We've added Echo devices throughout the house and we're constantly finding new uses for them.
 Like the use and networking ability for music and watching some video content. Background slideshow stops and has to be restarted to make it start again. Echo should be more capable with more apps for streaming.
 We got this as a xmas  gift for our daughter to watch her youtube &amp; Netflix.  She likes it however there is no app at this time for Netflix.
 Despite some of the reviews posted, we just love our Echo Show 2nd generations and is easier to use than our Sonos.
 I love the sound and very easy to setup.  I’m thrilled with all it can perform with just a voice command.  Perfect size for watching shows on HULU.  Highly recommend.
 video not so good
 cause this device is the beginning of a very good thing.  I can only think that this device will only get better.
 It won’t show video from any provider other than amazon prime.
 I love the large responsive screen and the better quality of the speaker. Adjusting the screen can be problematic initially, but overall it is a fantastic product!
 Wish it had a headphone jack however.  My smaller Echo does.
 Wanted to use it to replace the clock radio in my bedroom, but can’t adjust the size of the clock and can not see it from across the room. Using it in the kitchen but not for any purpose now.
 It looks nice and works. The touch screen is not very responsive. There is always somewhat of a lag. I did not expect that.
 I just love this!  My favorite is the music but there are so many other things to enjoy.  My 3yo grandson loves asking for songs and she's come to understand him!  Great sound too.  Can't say enough about how we enjoy it.
 Larger screen. Nice new design.
 The audio quality is fantastic. I am leaning the functionality of the show.
 Very bulky! Not clear enough, the connection network is slow.
 liked it very much
 The sound is much better than the 1st gen and the screen is enormous can see it from way across my kitchen.
 Beautiful picture quality on large screen. Sound is great. Really like the upgrades.
 Love it. Got this one as a gift. The screen is bigger and the sound quality is better than the first. Still love the 1st generation one I have. I love the drop in feature.
 The sound quality is my main like. The larger screen and overall look are also a plus.
 I love being able to listen to music and checking the weather. I like to use it for recipes and my favorite thing is for a grocery shopping list.
 Love the new Echo show. Bigger screen and it does so much. I have 3 of these.
 Got this for Christmas and I absolutely love it.  There is so much more that I need to explore with my new Echo Show!
 My husband bought this for me for my anniversary and I love it so far! The only issue is that it says my name wrong and I can't find any articles that tell me how to fix it, so that bugs the crap out of me.
 Screen size is awesome. With a personal photo background it’s a nice piece on my kitchen counter. Sound quality is good as well. I’ve had all of the Echo devices and really do like the new Echo Show
 This is a vast improvement over Gen 1.  Sounds a lot better and the bigger screen is much nicer.  Highly recommend using this in the kitchen!
 We love the Echo show. It’s fun and useful and we are always asking Alexa random things. My roommate got one and I was immediately hooked so I got my boyfriend one as his move in gift. It’s perfect!
 Software still a bit slow, but the sound and screen improvement make up for the shortcomings
 awesome, totally worth it.
 It’s an amazing product. I recommend it to everyone
 Works well, most functions require amazon prime...
 Sorry I sent a bad review on the fire stick. Not the new Echo Show.
 Bodacious sound quality
 They sound alot better than this one that came out before..
 We love our new echo show
 Great sound great screen
 Great  addition to our home. Just love it like all the features over the dot
 Overall well liked. Would be nice if you could disable the "try new things" which is quite annoying.<br/>Also, the ability to change the homescreen would be good.
 Received this for Christmas. Use it mostly for music while I read, BUT have done some video chats and streamed some shows. It is great.
 Awesome little tool.
 Easy to use. Understands my verbal commands even when I mess up
 Love it
 Its dosent have video capability to all video device
 This has a better bass. Picture &amp; video qualities are so good. Alexa is also providing lots of information on home screen which so good..
 Sound and picture is awesome! But gets confused easier than the dot it replaces when asking it to do smart features in house lights and cameras.
 Easy to set up and very helpful
 Very impressed with the sound and the picture. A must have!
 The echo show is pretty awesome. Plays movies and songs.
 Using it to communicate with offsite employees all over the country with no issues.<br/>Highly recommend the Echo Show<br/>Would be better if we could conference in 1 or 2 more associates.
 Cablevision's Optimum TV service is NOT compatible. After that, does it matter?
 This is Great!  I love the Echo Show!  Thank you
 My 1st echo. It works great. Speaker quality is excellent.
 So far so good been using the timers with cooking and having fun with announcements and dropping in...
 Wife and I both love it (them)!!  We purchased another soon after the first arrived.  Love being able to tell Alexa to play the music I want to hear on Prime Music without commercials. Great product!
 The Echo Show made a great gift and I also bought one for myself.  My family is having a great time with "Alexa"!!  A must buy!
 Super happy with this purchase.
 Sometimes is does not understand what I am asking<br/>During Christmas I wanted to listen to music but all it wanted to play was Christmas music<br/>So I stopped using it for awhile
 Love this. I have 3 dots, an original show, and this. It makes my life so much easier. It enables me to monitor cameras and automate my home. Love it so much giving another as a gift.
 I have only had the echo for two weeks now . With that being said so far it meets all my expectations! Sounds great and pic is very clear. Would recommend
 Nice device to visually see what a simple Echo Dot can do verbally.  Wish it could play Netflix, Plex or other video services. Not nearly the robust device it could be.
 Loved everything about it.  It was fast paced and kept you entertained  great story kept you guessing
 I love the screen size, and the sound quality.
 Good product as most Amazon devices.
 Nice. It work so nice. Easy to connect all WiFi devices
 I love my Show in my kitchen.  The ability to set multiple timers is so handy.  I love being able to pull up recipes and being able to scroll through them hands free.
 Easy to use the echo. Difficult to initially get skills. But well worth it.
 It was a gift. Mom loves it. Good price. I love that you can connect your Google calendar and email. Also, you can video chat with others if they have the Alexa app on their phone
 The sound is so much superior to the previous models.
 Excelent
 A gift for my son
 We have this in the kitchen, looks great, very easy set up. Connected to our ring doorbell and thermostat instantly. We are enjoying it!
 So far we use it mostly for music searches, either by title,Artist, genre. You can pretty much find any info you want just by asking :-)
 Sound System is great and Alexa hasn't gotten mad at me yet for failing to mention her name before requesting information or an action.
 Great innovation
 Gave as a Christmas gift to my wife..and she loved it and uses it in her office!  Very satisfied
 Where is espn or Netflix? Hulu is a nice start
 A nice upgrade from the first generation.
 Awsome
 I love my echo show love the sound good speakers and videos
 I like the bigger 10.1 inch screen and that the speaker is in the back.
 Love it ...still much to learn., easy to work great sound
 sound on the music is very good
 Arrived on time and no issues...opened box plugged it in..took less than.2 minutes to setup and had been wonderful...we now have 4 echo products and enjoy every one of them
 The improved screen size compared to gen 1 is the obvious major improvement. The sound quality is also better. The screen size allows for video watching and text reading is so much easier
 Fantastic!
 I absolutely love this echo and so will You
 Love it so far, works good.
 I Just can’t help but compare the sound to Sonos, and even with more room for speakers than the Sonos 1, it’s just not even close. Other than that it’s a great product....
 I like the many different skills you can enable on the show - and even more like the visual which i did not have with the regular echo.
 My security camera and music. It keeps losing connection and you can only use it for Amazon music and movies and on top of that  some music won’t play if you don’t have amazon unlimited
 Paired with Ring Pro...works great
 Awesome
 Lots of glitches. Alexa can’t understand half my commands.  Classical music response is ridiculous.
 Had the echo dot.  Loved it.  I am in love with the show
 love this new device in our home. If you multi task and play music and can’t hear the ring doorbell it gives you an alert... awesome device
 Best Gadgets that I ever owned!
 Sounds and looks great
 Love the bigger screen and more robust sound. Seems like Gen1 listens better though
 Great picture quality and great sound when listening to music.I would recommend this to everyone I know.We got this to keep in touch with our grandkids.awesome idea
 this thing is fun and informative.
 Great product.  More useful that I had imagined.
 I like it
 Alexa works well once we got it setup. No real instruction on how to sync cell phones, alexa app and alexa show to your devices, skills and camera.
 It’s nice. I had the previous Alexa Show. I like that the screen is bigger with the 2nd generation. Love the cooking videos. Love the drop in calls
 The sound quality is wonderful.  Set up was simple and its a great addition to my smarthome.
 The new Echo Show is fantastic.  Simple to set up and use.  The screen resolution is great and the sound is fantastic!
 The shipment arrived on time , but I can't get it to sync with my generation 2 speakers or the contacts program so the Echo Show just sits there on my counter taking up space.
 Nothing
 We have the first Echo Show with the 7 inch screen.  The 10 inch screen is great!  Would love to see it expand to a 15 inch screen.
 Nice screen. Much better sound than the 1st gen. Works great with my nest and ring devices.
 Love it
 I feel it could be designed to do even more. Otherwise I really like the video calls and other aspects.
 Excelente diseño y sonido
 What I liked was it displayed words on some YouTube videos, but I cook a lot and it couldn’t just open certain sites like Pinterest still figuring things out
 I cannot day enough about how much I love my Echo Show! Very good at understanding voice commands!!!!
 Size and color of the screen is better than I thought it would be! Love it!
 My expectation must of been to high thinking since I have Direct TV I should be able to look at Programs. For the price it should be able to access my direct tv programs.
 Great but still learning
 The sound is great.  Some of the music is repetitive, however, when you ask for example 70's music.
 Alexa is NOT as smart as Google. Too many "I don't know that" answers to what would seem to be simple questions.
 Best Echo device so far. Great speaker.
 I absolutely love this product. I set it up in my kitchen so that way I can ask for recipes and cooking ideas, which it can easily do that and then some.
 I love the unlimited amount of features on this product.  The new design fit right into my decor.  I bought more to give everyone as Christmas Presents.
 Meets all my expectations now I need to get cameras that hook up to this and everything that hooks up to this thing, my wife is having a blast with this thing
 Talk to family face to face
 Love it. Makes gen 1 look like it’s from the 1980’s.
 Love that it gives me prompts of what to ask for or how to use it better.
 I'm addicted to this thing. It does everything, but It is making me a lazier person, cause I don't have to physically do much. If I could just get Alexa to clean!!!
 Great! I have first gen and also spot version. Perfect screen and audio. This one is by far the best. It’s worth every cent. 👍 Excellent job Amazon 👍
 I love my new Exho show.  Much better than the first generation!!  Mine also came with a Hue Bulb!!
 Love it! I think having the screen compared to my old echo plus is a great touch!
 how did I ever live with out this!
 Of the echo in the sound O my goodness the sound is wonderful a play my music a look up things are exit things the best
 Big improvement excellent product
 Love it.  Easy set up, easy use.
 Love it so m
 Alexa was not odvere enough...limited with many searches...got google home instead and it’s way better!!
 I somehow lost sound and cant figure out how to reset it.When talking on video they can hear me but i cant hear them
 Sound system is great!<br/>Love the convenience,  doesn't pick up when television commercial advertises 'Alexa'. Best investment!
 Its has great sound.
 Great sound quality. Needs more screen and type of clock choices.Amazon has to make Alexa communicate with ANY TV remote.
 the sound and connectivity to my cameras was excellent.  i use it every day and love it.
 A nice addition to the echo family. I wish it had the ability to run a slide show from a album though
 Enjoy this device. Better sound quality and helps me with reminders. I like the weather and sports update for my specific city.
 I love the bigger screen and the sound is so much better!
 This Echo Show 2nd generation is great.  So glad that I upgraded from the echo show 1st generation.  The screen clarity and sound is awesome.
 So far this is the best Alexa Amazon has made. Sounds great and the screen is amazing works great with the ring.
 More apps needed!!
 Needs to be elderly friendly , who do not own smart phones
 I don’t like that I can’t play my music off my phone on it
 IT JUST LOOKS AND SOUNDS BETTER !!!
 I can see my family in  Dallas Texas.I leave in Illinois.I like it a lot.Gets me goof  recipes,weather,I check on my grandkids It’s Great
 Very nice clear screen , great sound. Face time phone excellent too.
 it is a fun toy for the family! now you can see and listen to Echo!
 If you like the original echo show you will love 2nd generation.  Bigger screen, colors are more vibrant and exceptional sound quality

 I enjoy using it for a photo player but only does it for awhile then just a stays on one picture. It plays music nicely
 Thank You
 So much bigger screen a much better product in the same footprint of space used.
 lOVE LOVE LOVE IT.  PLAY ALL THE MUSIC I WANT WHEN I AM IN THE KITCHEN.  NOTHING BETTER : )
 Great sound quality
 Easy to set up. I dinged the review one star because I'm having some trouble figuring out how to show slide show pictures on the background screen.
 Words of the songs are on the screen. Always shows the temperature and fun related items to amuse you. Sound is great. Love it!!!!!!!!
 Music sounds wonderful on the Echo Show.
 My wife loves , she set it up in kitchen easy to read recipes...
 Love the larger screen and awesome sound
 Still learning the ins and outs...haven't learned how to get it to search the web yet.....<br/>so far so good...too early to tell.
 Love it
 Much improved sound and the larger screen is great.
 Few updates needed for echo to consider wording correctly
 Echo Show 2nd Gen is great it plays music, The sounds is too loud but great, It doesn't get everything you ask or tell it but it's getting there.
 awesome
 Fabulous sound quality with pleasant look.  Connecting other Alexa products and related items is so easy.  I wonder how we did without it, hummm.
 I like it for music, recipes and use it to view my wyze camera (which is awesome and super economical)
 Haven't used it enough so far so good
 Very impressed with the sound quality
 The echo show is awesome! I love Alexa. I also love watching the news in the morning, which I do right from my show. It was a great investment!
 Love the new echo show, this is my second one. I most often use it with wifi cameras to monitor my pigs in the barn.
 Everyone in family uses daily. Kids are learning everyday with the million questions they are asking
 This is the best show yet, the picture and sound quality is amazing
 Love it get to see a d talk to my grandchildren
 It is great. The sound is great &amp; the clarity of the screen is awesome.
 Easy to use
 Perfect size for the kitchen with nice sound.
 I bought this for my granddaughter and she just loves it!
 I love the bigger screen and better sound !!
 I love it.
 I love my new echo show and Alexia does so much. My favorite is turning on and off things and the thermostat.
 like the screen with information about song&amp; singer. It was a gift from our grandkids. use it most for music
 Excellent sound and sharp look. Have the regular Alexa and the sound quality on the new echo show is better than me Sonos sound speaker.
 Great product. All it said it could do and more!
 Liked the speakers, low profile and the screen. Setting up skills is easy but time consuming.
 Took some points off cuz it has a few glitches but that sound quality oh WOW... very powerful. And a great clear picture!
 Love it
 Great device with easy setup.
 Love it, just as good as the first generation but has more features like the bigger screen.
 Very nice device, works with ring alarm
 I like it's  quick response and  sound quality.  I also like the screen size.
 A huge improvement in terms of audio quality, screen quality, and overall usability. Totally worth the upgrade!
 Still learning all the features but started using it every day immediately. The sound is amazing, couldn't be happier.
 Love this 10” screen. You can read it easier and is always giving you hints.
 Excellent experience! works perfect with my Prime account....beats Google Home hands down
 We love this and very easy to set up!
 Sound is amazing, easy to set up and easy to use.
 Awesome!!!<br/>I was happy with the 1st gen and they made it even better. Great sound!
 i really like the screen, easy to see and read. excellent sound system. clear quality in the sound system. handsfree is the best.
 It works great!! I just cannot get it to call another Echo Show so i can see my family members, other than that its wonderful....
 Music everywhere I go in the house.
 Item seems very quality in sound and workings, very happy with this gift!
 The screen is way bigger, sound slightly louder, but I most definitely like it more than the first generation show
 It’s been great!  Great sound and easy to use.
 Very nice and interesting product! Received this as a gift and I love it.
 Perfect. Works both local and international.
 I like this item very much. I do wish it had a more portable feature with rechargeable batteries.
 Its awesome product
 Sound quality is unmatched. Love it except for one thing, she is not as smart as Siri or Google.
 Great sound! Great picture! And the built in hub really makes connecting smart devices a breeze!
 Got it to use with daughter when she moves<br/>Out. Somewhat difficult to personalize but my family enjoys it
 Love it
 Self standing and great screen
 like this version so much better than the first version of echo show
 Good fun.  Lots of neat ideas scroll across screen and news tidbits
 Best addition to my kitchen. I love the ability to get recipes and instructions via the screen
 The sound is better than my BOSE radio. The microphones hear commands from a great distance. May buy 4 more.
 Amazing sound and functionality.
 I’m pretty happy with my original show but this new model blows it away. Extra large quality screen and about 59xs better speakers
 Box came damaged and ripped open
 Like the Show, very nice quality!  Would reccomend💓
 We love this even more than the 1st generation show.
 Dislike that I cannot watch Netflix on it.<br/>Love Sound and image/video quality
 Like the big screen
 The sound is so much better than I thought it'd be, great bass and loud. Loving the recipe guides as well.

 It’s nice but doesn’t play well with apple devices as suggested by sakesperson
 Working great with the MonocleCam Alexa Skill to show compatible RTSP IP cameras on your Echo Show (2nd Generation)
 Amazing device. Beautiful picture. BiG sound. Good bass. Worth every penny!!
 Bought this for recipes and music videos and door viewer and Skype and Hulu.
 Great story
 Works great
 Sound quality is not loud enough compare to first Gen. I think the problem is due to speakers placement.
 Love the big vibrant screen and it sounds amazing if you like listening to music this will work for you.
 Really hard to set up with you account and add any apps or figure out how to make video calls on iPhone.
 The screen is big and the sound is good quality!
 The sound is very good, works just like it suppose to.
 The sound quality is amazing!! I love the images display when I ask Alexa a question. Quite intriguing.
 Absolutely love it and look forward to adding additional items to connect.
 Did not have all the information I asked
 It’s great all around. Good size, great sound.
 Great sound!!! Screen is so much larger than the 1st generation. Love it!
 The best

 I use it a lot for setting reminders, adding things to my shopping list, and the music. Great sound!

 It has been a great tool with our home automation.  Love that I can see all the cameras from it too
 I like the quality of the sound and integrated keyboard to type some research. Great product so far

 Until Amazon and Hulu get their act together I cannot give this device a better review.<br/><br/>After several support efforts, we found that isp connections contributed the issue.  Thanks to the support staff.

 Great!
 Amazon I would really like to order a 2nd wall plugin. I don’t see one listed for this and the plugin for the Echo Show 1st generation doesn’t work with 2nd generation.
 The best yet!
 I originally purchased the Echo Show so I can communicate with my elderly parents who live in a different state.  My goal was to set them up with an Echo Show, then purchase a second Echo Show for myself and use the drop-in feature.  However, one of the requirements is to assign the Echo Show to a mobile number for a verification text.  My parents are elderly,  only use their old flip cell phone for infrequent calls and does not know how to text.  With this in mind, I wanted to assign my parents land line number to their Echo Show  in hopes Amazon had a call back verification.  After verification, my plan was to manage their Echo Show via the Alexa App via my smartphone.  After speaking with Amazon support, call back verification is not available and I was told the ONLY way for security verification is via a mobile phone with text capabilities.  With this in mind, though the Echo Show features seem to work great, it serves no real use for our senior citizen usecase if I cannot assign my parents land line number.  In lieu, i've used my cell phone number to get pass the security verification just to test the call features.  However, when we call my parents Echo Show via the Alexa App,  my cell number also rings.  Net Net: This product is useless for seniors who do not have or do not want to share their  cell phone number for security verification.  This is an easy fix, if AMAZON will simply allow a verbal confirmation if a land line number is desired.  Now I'm seriously considering returning my parents ECHO Show and have no need to purchase another one for our household.  It's a shame for this could really be a great product for keeping in touch with love ones, especially, Senior Parents  remotely.  Amazon, please be more sensitive to the needs of our elders.
 My mom bought three of the echo shows so each of us in the family could have one.  Her show’s mic stopped working so she got a free replacement because it was in warranty.  Mine recently start blowing fuses in my house no matter where I plug it into but after transferring me almost a dozen times between online chat and on the phone I was finally told it wasn’t in warranty when I asked them to replace it.  Shame on you amazon for not standing by your product.  You’d think amazon would be worried about this fire hazard of a device they sent me but alas....I doubt I’ll be buying anymore amazon made products again.
 This is ridiculous and so unfair you can’t keep up with all the new generations they keep releasing new ones  that are better I have the 1st Gen Echo Show and now they released a 2nd Gen which has a lot bigger screen and louder speaker I will not be upgrading anymore and will just have to settle for the 1st Gen because you dont know how to stop we should be able to send this one back and get the 2nd Gen to replace it for free if we wanted
 I bought to use as a bedroom speaker/ alarm clock, happy to say it works great for both! Exelent speaker quality that fills the room, and alarms are easy to use! Whisper mode is also extremely helpful so you can just whisper to the device a command, and Alexa won’t yell at you, but instead whisper back. My one issue is that the alarm is too easy to turn off... all you have to say is,” Alexa, stop” and she turns off the alarm. Great for sleeping in!
 I worked with the team on the phone for an hour, basically repeating the steps I had already done.  The screen continued to bounce and there were images on top of images so it was not usable as a video device.  Amazon had me send it in and a week later I received it back.  As the original went (from new) it worked for about two months and now starting to have the same issues all over again.  This is a stable object sitting on the Island and was put there for my grandchildren to interact with but so far the money and the product quality are not the same.  I now need to call back in and go through the same hour long process the next time I am back home, this was a present to keep in touch with my kids and grandchildren.
 all you want in response to your request is 'Hmmm, something went wrong try again in a few minutes' ... what a ripoff
 I love Alexa.  I love echo's.  I have 2 Echo's, 2 Echo Dots.  I have a Google Home, and I have one Echo Show (On which Youtube was taken away.  I bought it for Youtube, and wish I could return it now that Amazon lost access to Youtube by starting a petty feud with Google).  Without Youtube and access to the MILLIONS of videos on Youtube, the Show is fairly pointless.  Yes, you can video call....provided that you have friends/family that ALSO have the Show (or spot), or you wait until it's updated to use Skype.  You can make calls with any echo without video, so that feature isn't as needed as you'd hope.  Enter the Google Home Hub (Google home with screen).  This device probably wouldn't even exist if Amazon hadn't started this stupid feud.  But it does exist now.  It has a far smaller screen, and doesn't have a camera.  Those are the only negatives.  It obviously has access to youtube and the millions of free videos, as well as YouTubeTV (Perhaps the best Streaming TV service there is).  It's also about $100 buck cheaper than the show.  Now, I'm not saying don't by Alexa products.  Far from it.  I'm saying that the Show (and arguably the spot) have screens that frankly are a pointless feature.  Anything you can do (outside of video calls) on the Show/Spot, you can do on all the Alexa devices.  Google Home and Alexa are both very good, both handle different things better than the other, and are complimentary to each other rather than "Competition", but Amazon refused to see it that way, and in the process of trying to compete, basically created competition they didn't want while also hindering their own ability to compete.  My advice:  Buy the Google Home Hub, or wait for the second gen Google Home hub which will likely feature a bigger screen and a camera, and probably still be less expensive.
 Arrived broken and not working after being the first to receive it....how does that happen...looked like they let a 3 yr old open my package and play with it then pack it back up.  horrible
 I bought the Show Gen 2 to add to the multiple Echos I already own.  Echos are great for whole house music from Amazon Music and iHeart Radio.  The bass on the Show Gen 2  is a little boomy but that can be dialed back with the onboard equalizer. I quickly discovered that the screen at least for me, lacks any practical usefulness. The most frustrating part is that the screen goes to sleep when streaming music and you can no longer see the title/artist info. You have to wake it up by saying "Alexa".  Very disappointing, There is no user setting to change that. Also, I was under the impression that when not playing music it would sit there on the kitchen counter continually displaying weather information with a background of photos you've uploaded. It does not. it goes to sleep. I returned mine to the store today. That said, if you want to buy an Echo and you don't mind spending 200 plus dollars this is a quality speaker. This device has tons of potential and I really wanted to like the screen feature. If you all you do is stream music, don't expect the screen to add much of anything to the user experience. I don't use Prime video but of you do, the Show might be a good choice for you.
 I love the new echo show.  It's so much nicer looking, sound is great and I can watch more on it and the browser is the best.  I am sad that I had bought the first one not too long ago and now I want to get rid of it so that I can get another 2nd gen show.
 I already own an Echo and a Dot so when I learned that the Show would work with Allrecipes I believe that would be nice for a kitchen installation. I bought one and soon learned that the Apt sucks. There is no way that the Apt was tested in a kitchen. The recipes disappear, the timing is too quick. I'm sorry that I bought it.
 I bought an Amazon Echo Show on November 22 of 2017.  Over time it started to develop vertical lines across the display.  At first it was mostly during image transitions, when scenes changed.  Now it has vertical lines on every image all the time.  I contacted customer support, and because the device is only 6 weeks out of warranty, they offered me a pathetic 15% off should I purchase a new one.  The support rep was very argumentative.  I complained and got so-called supervisor who offered me a $50 dollar credit should I purchase a new one - the device is listed at $229.99.<br/>I note that there are hundreds of complaints of lines across the screens of 1st generation Echo Shows, and Amazon now has a 2nd generation version.  I have been a customer of Amazon for 20 years and have spent a lot of money with them.  The support for a device 6 weeks out of warranty is pathetic.  The service of their help support, all from heavily accented individuals is argumentative and pathetic.  I asked the supposed supervisor, Anastacia M - she wouldn't give me her whole name - to connect me with someone who could assist me,  She said that there was nobody else.  I asked her to have someone to contact me who could resolve the issue. She said she would pass it on.  6 weeks out of warranty on a defective device where the problem showed up gradually - during the warranty period and that is supposedly the best that Amazon can do on their own product.
 The screen is nice, 720P. Maybe the next version will have 1080P. The rear sounding speakers are way too heavy in the bass for my taste, even though some really like it. It doesn't sound as good as the first gen amazon echo. Almost has a muffled sound and would probably have been better had they made them forward speaking speakers. Due to the over 10000 skills there is lots to keep you occupied till next years version. Unless you find this at a really good price I'd hesitate in rushing out to buy.
 Besides the obvious money grab, this devices existence just doesn’t make sense.  Let’s see what’s been addressed &amp; what hasn’t regarding this 2nd generation Echo Show.  First off the screen just doesn’t have that “WOW” factor.  As big as it is it just doesn’t grab you.  The resolution sucks &amp; it’s not even true HD!  You think they’d spring for a dynamic screen this time around but nope, they went &amp; settled for 720 p instead of the full 1080.  You get a better screen from your cell phone than this.  C’mon you know they could’ve done better but they just settled for larger not better.<br/><br/>Certain design flaws just weren’t addressed that I was looking forward to being fixed.  The Echo Show’s “tilt” disappointingly enough wasn’t fixed.  The device is made to slant upwards, so when you are video chatting or Skyping, you either have to physically tilt the Show down or buy one of those stands, that straightens it out that helps to correct its field of view so you &amp; those who you’re talking to can see you more clearly instead of being cut off by the head or waist.  If it’s not a flaw &amp; I know there are those of you running to your keyboards to tell me so, then why do those stands exist?<br/><br/>Plus, if you’re not going to fix the obvious design flaw, then you could include a camera that can pan &amp; tilt, instead of fixed camera that can’t in a device that is facing “upwards” anyway.  You might spring for a better camera with more resolution, maybe one with a Carl Zeiss lens that does pan, tilt AND ZOOM!<br/><br/>It’s like Amazon is beating its chest &amp; saying “Yeah we know what’s wrong it with &amp; guess what? WE DON’T CARE &amp; WER’E NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT!  YOUR PROBLEM! SO BUY IT &amp; STUFF IT!”  You get the feeling that they just don’t care about their tech enough to remedy or improve upon it, especially in future upgrades.<br/><br/>I’ll give Amazon one more chance.  Let’s see what the 3rd generation of Echo Show brings to the table in the future.  If they screw around &amp; don’t do anything then I’ll just write it &amp; them off, that’s all.  By then there’ll be too many other choices to get hung up on the Echo Show anyhow, that’s for sure.<br/><br/>Amazon comes off as either being too bored, or clueless regarding what they release.  Why should they?  There are plenty of lemmings out there who’ll grab ANYTHING that they’ll put out, no matter how crappy.<br/><br/>Their whole Echo/Alexa lineup needs to finally go from “here to there” &amp; it’s not.  Some of the devices are already stagnant in their 2nd generations.  In order to justify the existence of Alexa &amp; them this needs badly to be redesigned, retrofitted &amp; to be a device worth a damn.  Sorry for the rant but this POV needs to be stated by someone, somewhere for the record
 I loved my Echo Show so much, I purchased a second one for the kitchen. The first one I placed in the living room.  I loved it so much. I have it connected to various other alexa devices throughout my house and in the garage. When you play music the words appear for you. I purchased a second one for the kitchen. When you ask Alexa for recipes, she shows you everything you need for the recipes, and a lot of times you will get a video. You can play slide pictures, ask for the weather or the forecast, and she will even show you trending posts that you can ask about. I also told you that I have connected my devices. The reason for that is if I am cleaning the house - I will ask Alexa to play a song (I have grouped them together and called the group everywhere) and then I will ask her to play it everywhere.  The song will play in every room in my house. So as I move from room to room cleaning, I will hear the music. You don't have to hook them all together. For example, if your husband doesn't want to listen to the same music as you are listening to - don't connect the garage Alexa to the group. I highly recommend the Echo Show. My favorite so far - and did I forget to mention - the sound is beautiful.
 Whomever is giving this thing rave reviews blows my mind. It could be amazing, but instead it’s just a frustrating mess of a product that was obviously released way before it was ready.<br/><br/>The home screen: an absolute disaster. It’s not customizable at all and such poor information and layout that it only frusrates you instead of providing anything of value. Example: Let’s say you chose to show “stocks”. It shows either a sentence about the dow or a graph overview and that’s it. You can’t highlight stocks you follow, or look up stocks, or see news about stocks. Nothing.<br/><br/>Example: photos. You spend an hour downloading amazon photos app, create an album (also a diaster. Some iphone albums like shared and favorites don’t even show up, and you can’t select all, you must individually select each photo to add. Time consuming mess). Then when you try to add a photo album to “display. Background. It will show the album for half a second and then say to download the amazon photos app and go back to home screen. Glitch error?? Who knows.<br/><br/>Example: hulu. You sign into your hulu account and it doesn’t show the lineup or your shows. So you try to search for a show...instead of being able to click on say “this is us” it pulls up a million tiles of episodes that aren’t even separated by season snd show no details. Again a confusing mess.<br/><br/>Example: spotify. I say “alexa play spotify playlist favorites” nope. “Alexa play “kings of leon.” Nope. Your only option is to pick the spotify song on your phone and choose the echo show as the device to play on like a speaker.<br/><br/>The echo show is just a giant frustration. It’s a time consuming mess trying to sync your phone app to the show device and even once it’s connected, it sucks bc of the crappy layout, errors, or lack of any valuable information.<br/><br/>All i can say is this makes me have a great appreciation for apple products that are never released until highly functional and relatively easy to set up.
 ...there is still no AUX OUT on this. Even the lowly Echo Spot has an AUX OUT.
 I have no idea how anyone thinks this is "EASY" to connect devices to.  Sure; SUPER easy to get connected to wifi, but it fails to find devices to connect, no matter how many times I try (I have honestly given up), and it fails to allow me to group lights (why would I want to say, "Alexa, turn off Living Room 1", wait, then say, "Alexa, turn off Living Room 2", wait, and then continue with the 3rd light, and THEN have to individually do the same for 2 Dining Room lights, and then EVERY OTHER LIGHT IN MY HOUSE that I want Alexa to control?  Let alone my cameras, locks, etc.  ABSURD!!!  How can this thing be considered even "good" at controlling things in your house if it can neither "find" devices nor allow us to "group" them.  Don't advertise that you can say, "Alexa, turn on my lights" if you can't even group them (and, yes...  I'm using the mobile app first).  So far, this is at least as useless as the Google Home Mini (except at least THAT actually WAS simple to set up and use).  At this point, I'm just SUPER sorry I seem to have wasted over $200.
 With the two elderly adults, we have four adults and two kids in this household though the Alexa doesn't seem to allow us to do drop-ins across all the three Alexa devices (two shows and a 7th gen kindle) nor does there seem to be a way to centrally manage content.  For example there is address book functionality.  There is no way to share the address book across the devices so that for example grandma only sees her contacts (she gets confused with more than 5) or so that the kids can only see the curated contracts that dad has approved for them etc...
 Hands down such an improvement over the original screen in so bright and clear and the sound is just WOW Buy it Buy it Buy it you will Love it
 This unit is not compatible with IPHONE 10 and newer iPhones. You can’t check in on your home with any newer IPhones.  It is only compatible with older iPhones- 8 and 7. Wouldn’t recommend this product.
 Other than simple tasks such as adding an item to your grocery lists, turning on/off lights, etc., I have found that the Echo devices and Alexa are completely useless.  I have been comparing them to Siri responses and OK Google responses and here is the information...  Almost 30% of the time I receive the information I am looking for from Alexa.  70% of the time I hear, "Sorry, I don't know that."  Whenever that happens I try Siri on my iPhone and get the answer.  Then we try OK Google on my partners Android and we almost always receive the answer.<br/><br/>Save your money and go to Google Home or the new Apple devices coming out.  You will be much happier if you are planning to use Alexa for looking things up on the Internet, etc.  If you just want it for simple tasks, it is good.  Otherwise, I recommend not investing your money in something you will learn to not use as I have.  Since I never receive the answer, I have learned to not even try anymore.  So sad that I believe Amazon that they are always updating this service.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the only thing they update is their skills/apps.  That's all well and good, but if you can't say, "Alexa, how do you...." and receive a response from an Internet search, what is the point?
 The sound quality is very well upgraded, big screen, camera can be disabled, many tasks completed, ... We are happy.  Now, if only we can figure out how to timed snooze the Ring announcements and notifications, the constant motion notifications  can drive people crazy when there are gardeners working around the house :D
 I have an original  Echo gen 1 , a Echo show gen 1 and now upgrading to an Echo show gen 2. While they are all AMAZING. The kne thing I wish they would incorporate  is an HDMI out.. i have my EchoShkw next to my 60" T.V. would be great to watch the grandkids on that instead  of the 10 in one. Other then that Love my Echos!!
 If you would like to waste an entire day on setting this useless paperweight up be my guest. Instead mail me 200 dollars and I’ll send you a brick.  Free shipping.<br/>Combersone setup process that requires multiple sign in processes. Multiple not clear on which app to download and instructions are horrible. The Alexa show does not even show as an option on the app.<br/><br/>Please save your time and money
 I bought the Echo Show, the screen constantly blinks, flickers and bounces up and down.<br/>Amazon has totally ignored my attempts to get it corrected.
 We have Echo devices all over our home and love them. We have several echo dots, the Echo Spot and the First Generation show along now with the new show. We use them all in some way. The ability with the Echo show to watch your amazon videos or now Hulu is amazing. With all Echo devices if you have Amazon Music you can play your playlist or other music through the everywhere group to fill your home with Music. The echo show is great for a kitchen as we have ours there to either watch Live tv on Hulu or even your Flash Briefings while either cooking or having morning coffee. The Echo Show and Echo Spot have buttons to turn off the mic if you do not want it on. I would fully recommend any of the Echo products .
 I really love this new generation Echo Show. Beautiful screen and amazon sound! It’s finally a very useful product used by everyone in our household including our 3 year old. We love to see a rich GUI for all our interactions with Alexa, specially when asking for the weather or playing music. The capability to “open Firefox” has made this a very useful gadget with limitless capabilities. We can surf the web to read the news, watch streaming video from YouTube, DailyMotion etc. Another think we use a lot is to see the camera feed - “Alexa, show me the backyard” works every time and we all love it! Really happy with this 5-Star product!
 You cannot set the notification volume separate from the voice level. If you can here it ring from another room you cannot stand to sit close to it to talk (turn it down each time) and too many times people forget to turn the volume back up and you cannot here it ring. For a machine with all the useless apps this is a real frustration
 The Echo Show could kill the competition if they would have the one missing feature: YouTube.  Specially if you are a YouTube Premium user.  Definitely missing the boat on this one.  I will pass until they end up their childish feud with Google.
 I use echo all day everyday for music info books et al; it's a great product.<br/>Please ask Echo, "Alexa, play talk radio 1210."<br/>Alexa answers, "Sorry, I cannot access that radio station."<br/>Of course not, Bezos bought the Wash Post to demonize Trump.<br/>Echo will certainly not let you listen to Rush Limbaugh.
 If this had YouTube I would have bought 2 more. But no, Amazon must free just a bit threaten by that. Endless possibilties. that they came up FAR short of!!!
 So far I'm Loving it. Just had a video chat with my friend. And sound and picture is great. Had fun listening to music and dancing in my kitchen. I also love the fact that I can look at recipe's and listen to my music at the same time
 Bought a set. One for here and the other for the for grandkids who live in Alaska. Sound is great, picture is clear with no lag. Alexa features are informative and entertaining.
 The new echo show is a great improvement in design and manufacturing quality. The software is also better as it recognizes a variety of accents and provides good answers!
 For those who are looking for a device that puts the consumer needs before their own,, this is not the product.  No YouTube TV or really any support for MS/GOOGLE services.
 In order to get full use of this, is necessary to know things that will be nice to have in a manual<br/>Yes, web site information is OK but does not help as a true manual
 I love my Echo Show, bottom line, YouTube works on the Firefox browser, and the browser works quite well.  Stream Player is a great skill; you can watch lots of online TV stations.
 I love the Echo Show. The sound quality is great! I can’t wait for more skills to add screen functionality.
 nice screen, works well for skype.  Incessant suggestions to Try "Alexa...." can become annoying.
 Great for viewing photos and time!  At night just tell Alexa to turn the screen off and it goes black!! Very nice! Touch the screen and it shows you the time with a photo!
 I literally watched every episode on the edge of my recliner, leaning forward.  Can't wait for the next season!  Acting is great and the storyline well done.
 VERY POOR image quality, would not recommend
 Every so often our Echo Show loses sound.  Rebooting does not solve problem and very difficult to find solutions through Amazon.  Disappointing customer service.  When it works, it's cool.
 I love my new Echo show. Alexa is awesome the sound is great the screen is clear. Was so excited I purchased another one for my daughter so that we can FaceTime each other. I love being able to ask Alexa to play my favorite music. She can hear me clear across the room.
 I bought this for my mother, who does not have a smart phone, so that we can help keep her organized remotely, but she cannot maintain her own address book or calendar within the device. I had to load my contacts from my phone and I had to attach a cloud-based calendar. For a device that is advertised as a family use unit this seems pretty cumbersome, if not wholly undesirable. It should have a built in calendar and a contact list that can be managed from within the device itself.<br/>That being said, the my mother loves the voice controlled speaker as well as the news and weather reports.<br/>Three stars because an electronic personal assistant should be able to manage simple tasks like a calendar and a contact list.
 This was 250 after tax. For that price, you can do better than a tablet without a battery.
 Needs video games and a controller.... you guys should make that happen and I'll give it 5 stars
 Update (12/19/18): Today I tried watching some Youtube videos. I noticed within 5 minutes, the Echo would close the browser entirely and go back to the home screen. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! I never owned an electronic device that pissed me off so much. I'm ready to make my own Youtube video (that you would have to watch on any other device except the Echo Show) of me shooting this piece of garbage and FINALLY getting some enjoyment out of it.<br/><br/>Update (12/17/18): So I've had my Show for 2 months and I have to say that nothing really changed. It still remains an expensive disappointment. There has been an issue since the beginning where after watching so many videos on Prime Video, the show will no longer play videos until the device is restarted. My volume down and mute buttons are going to wear out from having restarted it so much. I have to do this about every 2 days. I know it needs to be restarted because when trying to play a video of any kind from any source, the Show will perform really slow and seem to load for a minute or two when selecting a video, then just back out and not play anything. This is kind of ridiculous. At the time of writing this, there is still no Netflix either. I see the Shows are sold out until after Christmas. I hope people aren't buying these as gifts or they're going to have some pretty disappointed spouse's/relatives.<br/><br/>I previously wrote a review with more stars, but the more I use the Echo Show, The more i'm starting to dislike it. Watching the movies that you own on Prime Video is a nightmare. Once you get a movie or show playing, it works fine. But the voice commands to get certain movies to play is a nightmare. Name a certain movie and she will say it back wrong, or say she couldn't find it. Try saying play whatever from my library, and she thinks it's a skill. It's super frustrating. Have Alexa turn lights off during a movie and the movie pauses for about a minute so it can show you a toggle button for you lights. Pause a movie? it'll stay paused for about a minute, then go to the home screen, to which there is no "resume" or "continue movie" command. You have to tell her to play whatever show or movie again. I bought this to replace an old Samsung tablet that I had on my desk to watch Youtube or Netflix while doing other things. I miss those days to be completely honest. I should have stuck with the regular screenless Echo that I had.
 For those who are debating an Alexa device with screen capabilities, this will depend on what you want to use it for.<br/><br/>In taking the smart home plunge, I ended up purchasing 4 Echo Shows (2nd generation) and 2 Facebook Portal+’s for my home because I wanted both, PA &amp; Drop in function, but also a primo video chat. Here’s why I have both:<br/><br/>The Echo Show (2nd generation) exceeds the Portal + in overall functionality. It provides all of the features of the previous model and more. I wanted some (or all) of my primary devices to sometimes act as a PA &amp; also be able to use the ‘Drop in’ feature when I am not home. I live in a condo and have an 8wk old puppy coming. Though I work from home, at some point if I need to go on a run or leave for an hour or two, I am still able to access the camera and speak to her if she’s barking at the front door. For now, Facebook Portal does not have this feature. With the Echo Show there is also no need for an external hub for most of my smart devices because it’s built right in. I’m unsure if Portal has this. With the Show, there is also direct access to the internet. Just ask Alexa to play movie trailers, Prime videos, etc. The display is nice, but I would chalk up the video calling and ‘Drop in’ quality to better than that of my security cameras (also high quality).<br/><br/>The Facebook Portal+ display and AI camera technology far exceeds that of any other device I’ve used. I purchased this for the calling feature - which is its’ primary function. During a call, you no longer need to employ being your own camera man during the call - it’s completely hands-free and smoothly follows you around the room like a movie director. I was impressed by the range at which it accurately followed me and will even follow in the direction of your voice if you happen to step out of the frame. Very limited on other functions though and I expect more are soon to follow within the year once the ‘data breach’ blah blah stuff calms down a bit. Though the Portal does not support the PA &amp; ‘Drop in’ functions that the Echo Show has, I can still control all of my smart home devices &amp; groups with ease and employ all of my routines with no problem.<br/><br/>If you’re looking for all-around functionality and more features the Echo Show (2nd) is the way to go. If quality video calling is the priority, then you can’t beat the Portal+ for now - it far exceeds everything else in that arena.
 Look, this is a beautiful product.  Huge, High Def screen, great sound, etc.  The only negative is - we're still waiting for fun exciting things to do with it.  We hooked it up with LifX lights, Ring doorbell and cameras, and the new Amazon plugs.  All that is great, you can turn things on and off, but with the exception of the Ring video, not much needs the beautiful screen.<br/><br/>We use it to video chat with the kids &amp; grandkids, and I think the stationary, hands free Echo is better for video chat than having to hold a phone.  But let's get some more fun and interesting video content going!!
 The sound quality you get will blow you away!  This is our first experience with the Echo Show since we didn't pick up the first generation.  Luckily though I didn't miss out on the newest version since my wife surprised me with the preorder a couple days ago and man am I impressed with it.<br/>We have ours in the bedroom, it serves as our alarm, smart TV, voice assistant and smart speaker. Everything it was meant for. I could see it being used in a kitchen setting too if you've used Alexa to help with cooking.<br/>We have several Echo devices around the house including the Echo Plus in our living room where we started our smart home experience. The Echo Plus has some great sound quality don't get me wrong, but the Show definitely is the better sounding system.  Adding this bad boy to our inventory of Echo devices was a great choice. You should do the same. Enjoy.
 Terrible constant advertisements, won’t turn off advertisements,  got wyze bundle for baby cam, cam shows only for short time then returns to useless advertisements, unable to get movement or sound alerts or move cam to see parts of room, terrible flashing advertisements all night long keep me awake when there is no emergency big boomy bass sound, can’t tell if any Dolby or quality sound processing is even present, really!? I can’t believe with all the sound engineers in the world this would come out. I am planning to return and wait for much better model. I would keep if I could turn off advertisements and keep baby cam on constantly as I can always ask for weather time  and news updates. I am surprised it does not even offer me my amazon wish list adverts or senior with bad eyesight sized time and weather options for images to be easily voice customized or free tickets to a local event or that my amazon packages have been delivered or my returns must be sent by date soon. Somebody wake up and make it useful instead of pushing sales advertisements that make me wish for another remote control just to mute the unrelated useless visuals. I have one echo to control my sonos and three iOS to see wyze cams. I am sorry to say that voice control over basic wyze app function and basic customizable echo show functions are not available. I also wrote in email customer service in Alexa app to complain about shows inabilities and no response at all. I get perfect customer service about all other buys and returns but why not customizing the amazon echo<br/>Show itself? Surprise surprise! Well how many upgrades to go until really useful? I need to care for another life now and I can’t wait. For all the time and years on amazon they can’t instantly make useful content available to me? I also expected amazon to compete with apple speaker and sonos speaker but no surround sound processing and at least the bass is booming. I am looking forward to new models and I enjoy most all other parts of amazon ecosystem.
 I received the 2nd generation Show along with two 3rd generation Dots (which I paired for stereo) and immediately set up the Show. It was easy, and in a matter of minutes I was up and running.<br/><br/>I began familiarizing myself with its nuances. It wasn't much of a learning curve, as I own the Spot, so...  I must say I was impressed with the screen resolution and size. Bright, easily readable from across the room. I love the color details when viewing Youtube videos, as it was faithfully reproduced.<br/><br/>Music was loud, and some good bass was present. It was easily navigable via the touch screen, or voice commands. And the browsers, Firefox and Silk, launch on command. Cool. Say, 'launch Youtube', and you're there. Sign in to you YT account, and play all videos in your History; or simply tap the address bar, and when the keyboard appears, type in what you want to see.  It isn't a seamless way to go about it, but at least it works.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the Show really delivers on Amazon's stated features and capabilities. I am happy with the Show, and if you aren't very picky, you may be too. Let's begin...<br/><br/>Should you consider purchasing the 2nd gen. Echo Show?  If you like your music sounding great; if you like watching videos on an immersive 10" screen; if you want to browse the internet as you would on a large tablet; watch Vevo or Youtube--yes, you should consider the Echo Show over its competitors. The 2nd generation Echo Show is vastly improved over the 1st generation Echo Show, which looked boxy, and had only seven inches of real screen real estate. Sound on that one was, at best, acceptable. Nothing to dance about, though.<br/><br/>But on the newer incarnation the sound quality is quite good--no, damn good! You'll get powerful stereo sound. Bass punches solidly, so that you can actually feel it. Highs and mids takes care of rounding out the music quite well, and in stereo. Amazon improved the speaker system so, that you'll wonder how it could sound so good from a smallish footprint. But it does! And this thing can get quite loud. It filled our rather large bedroom without distortion, even nearly way up. Put it in a large living and your next party will be complete with D.J. Alexa on hand.<br/><br/>Getting around on the internet with either the Silk browser or Firefox was as easy as saying, "Alexa, open...", and you're taken to the browser where you key-in what site you wish to visit. Sure, the on-screen keyboard is a bit clunky, but you get used to it.<br/><br/>I've not tested the video-calling feature, or the drop-in feature, but from the rave reviews on Amazon about this, it's a winner. Skype will soon be coming to the Show.<br/><br/>I was impressed by the screen quality and accurate color reproduction, even from across the room. Most aren't going to want to sit through an entire two-hour movie, though, but you could if you wanted to. A greater majority relegate the Show to kitchen duty, where it shines. Still, any room (not the bathroom!) is a good place for the Show.<br/><br/>So, in my opinion, yes you should consider bringing home the Show instead of the competition's products, as Amazon got it right the second time around. And at $230, I'd say it is priced just right to go.<br/><br/>Well, I'll play with this gadget a few days more. In the meantime, The Echo Show must go on!
 This echo show  Hub will blow your mind it takes everything you have that can work with Alex work so much better than before. The video screen is picture is amazing. Once we learn everything it can do it’s is becoming a tool to make our lives better Just the list app you just ask Alex to add butter to the shoping list when one of us go to the grocery store we open the list and see what everyone has add that we need it really is excellent. We have the ring doorbell just ask Alex to show me the door and it’s so fast because of it being a hub we have  noticed  That the seed or your internet don’t slowdown. We are very impressed. Thanks Amazon for making great product for families to use in their home and make our lives easier
 I put one of these in my kitchen and I’m loving it! I’ve come to love the echos scattered around my house and having one that sounds and looks great for recipes and watching prime video while I cook has been great. I highly recommend a stand for it too. I like to adjust it for optimal viewing if I’m right on top of it at the stove or across the room. The speakers sound great for this price range too. The only bad thing I can say is that with the speakers on the back, if I push it too far into the corner under my cabinets the sound bouncing around can get a little weird and the bass goes a little wonky when it gets really loud under there.
 Started up fine, installed update, but would not recognize any external speakers.  Took a couple of factory resets before it would recognize external Bluetooth speakers/devices.  No problem streaming to device, but could not stream/pair to external devices... be patient and restore to factory defaults a few times if needed.  Otherwise, big improvement over First Gen.
 I like the Show.  It's fun being able to see the lyrics of songs being played.  The sound is good.  The only issue I've seen that is a tiny bit annoying is that when I tell Alexa to turn off the screen, she does.  But sometimes when I walk in the room a while later, the screen is magically back on again.  There are only two of us living here and I know my spouse isn't reactivating it, so I'm not sure why it's happening.<br/><br/>One improvement I'd like to see with all the Alexa devices is the ability to pick my own WAKE word.
 I love the sound so much better than the dot! We are in the process of converting our household to work with Alexa...and everything is so convenient! I have it turn off my Christmas lights, scentsys, and lamps. Also looking at the home security system to tie in with it. Alexa calls me Queen Amanda...how can I give her a bad review?? Seriously, the sound on the music is great, and I love everything you can do with it...although, we have barely scratched the surface. Really glad we made this purchase.
 It's larger screen is better and the sound is better and deeper than the 1st generation.  I wish it had more options for video apps, but more are probably on the way.<br/>The Hulu function on it is cool, but it doesn't give you the option to choose what episode to view.  It auto starts any show at episode 1, which is annoying.<br/>The SirusXM app, Amazon Music app, and Spotify work great on it.<br/>A fun kitchen device!
 I'm so glad I waited for Gen 2. The screen now fills up the whole front in comparison to version 1. The sound is amazing, and Alexa can pick up your instructions very easily even when talking at a normal tone and being 5 feet away from me. Video chats on the Echo Show with family members are very cool and so much better than using Facetime, Duo, and Skype. This is a great purchase and you won't be disappointed.
 I agree with alot of the other positive reviews. Echo just keeps getting better.
 If you want all of the flexibility without the pain, get a Fire Tablet with a stand and a couple of good speakers. (7" Tablet: $40, Tablet Stand with speaker: $25. )You'll get all of the features PLUS better touch interaction, better video capability (especially video selection and interactivity) including Netflix and you can take it with you. I waited for this upgrade only to be disappointed that it still misses the boat on Netflix and getting a movie to come up requires that you specifically know what you're looking for... no simple browsing through Amazon Prime. For a device that is supposed to make things easier, Amazon has gone out of their way to make things more difficult and even strange at times. Mine ends up being nothing more than an Alexa speaker with a screen that I never look at.
 This is my 6th Echo and first "Show."  I really like to screen quality and speaker quality.  I use it in my kitchen and it comes in handy for so many things.
 Just received my latest toy from Amazon to add to the collection and it the one a only Echo Show 2. I have a family member that has the first edition of the Show, and after seeing it I was convinced I needed it. In comparison to the first edition the sound quality is just AMAZING! (I’m actually scared to raise it to MAX because my neighbors would hear everything coming from it)<br/>Display is really clear! And I love the simplicity it brings from understanding it to operating it!<br/>The #1 thing I love about it is, the fact that I see my family/friends with it, help cook, listen to music, and check my cameras just by asking...<br/> Could it get any better??
 I got the new Echo Show (2nd Gen) after having owned the previous Echo Show for awhile and find that the bigger screen and sound is a great improvement.  I liked the previous Echo Show (I bought 3) however, the new Echo Show does improve on video with the new screen and listening to music is awesome.
 I had the original show and am so glad I upgraded! This screen is so much bigger/better. I love watching Hulu on it while I'm cooking! I also love that it has a web browser. The sound is great also! To anyone questioning upgrading I would highly recommend doing it!
 I traded my 1st Gen Echo Show in and received a nice credit as well as 30% off on the Gen 2. The screen is beautiful and overall design much improved. I wish it would come with a stand (sold separately), but that is not a big deal... Highly recommend.
 I'm still playing with this, and realizing just how helpful this actually is. Just ordered a smart thermostat to go with it, already hooked up my AV Receiver to it, linked my email and so much other stuff. So much more to learn!!!
 It is a high quality product and makes parts of my life more injoyable and convienent but it blows my mind that they haven’t added some simple stuff in there like Netflix and a functional internet browser.
 Alexa with a display works great! I love how I can display my photos I uploaded to Amazon Photo cloud. My kids love it too. They used it to watch Amazon Prime videos. Good stuffs.
 Never thought this would be something I would use. I am getting to know this gift, Echo show so far has been great to make face to face calls to relatives far away and playing music, it has helped with sleep playing white noise. I know there is so much more to use it for, just getting to know what it can do. So over all I have enjoyed what I have used it for!
 Works great! Finding new ways to use it every day for music and household activities like timers. Love that I can talk to my grandchildren and follow their activities.
 Love the echo show!!! Excellent sound and picture. Fun to play with, we love the games, music feature, reminders, shopping list, and drop in features
 The demonic forces in my place have discover how to use Alexa via whispered vocal commands to turn off and on lights in my home. It’s become a troublesome.<br/><br/>I recently blessed it with holy water and this stopped. Thank god for faith based intervention.<br/><br/>Lol
 We like the appearance and size. It's sturdy and sits solid on the table. The picture quality is brilliant. We like the prompts at the bottom of the screen that tell us options to ask Alexa. The sound quality is sharp.
 Love the big screen and the speakers nice and loud love every thing about this product.
 have not used it much so far but its nice to see words to songs. grandkids love it
 Love the new screen size, the sound quality is better than my gen 1
 still exploring the world of echo. I like the apps that are well written. Kinda hard to remember exactly what the app allows you to say. Sometimes you can be close but your app will only allow certain phrases. That could be expanded on.<br/>Overall it is a great product.
 Just love this device, works as advertised!
 Love, love my new friend
 Bigger screen.
 all around excellent
 The 2nd Generation Echo Show certainly lives up to It's reputation.  The sound is rich.  Pair it with Amazon Unlimited Music and you've got one great combination !
 Learning, but love it
 Pricey
 The sound quality on the echo show is great. The bass is good. The camera could use an upgrade though
 I really like the bigger screen and the improved audio sound. I am definitely glad iI upgraded to the second generation
 My family love this product so much my wife wants more around the house
 I like it, still needs to get smarter though. Lots of Times it can’t help me.
 Excellent
 Great quality and sound/ features
 We love it still trying to figure everything out
 I like it most for music
 no kindle, no app store for android apps?  why do I think of kindle hd with Alexa?<br/>If I design a new model, I 'd consider two separable parts. One part is for speakers and main battery &amp; AC parts like a docking station.  The other part is for new kindle like 10.1'' kindle.  I am willing to pay additional $ for them.
 I found this Echo Show yesterday, and I like it. Great design.
 Good
 got this for an xmas present from my daughter . thought it would be difficult to figure out . but I believe since I have an amazon echo dot it turned out to be very simple to hook up . awesome present I gotta say and I havnt even begun to figure out all the things i can do with it .so far I can watch any video of any song I want . great great device .
 I love it! I am discovering new ways to use it each day. Asking questions, listening to music (and seeing the words), jokes, spellings . . . the list goes on and on. I am sure there is a lot more for me to discover. I haven't tried any of the "smart" plugs, camera, etc. but that is to follow.
 I have had multiple Echo devices, including the first generation Show. This is definitely an improvement on that, bigger screen, better music and sound, and video. However, more than any other single function, we use it as a digital picture frame. The background picture, when the device isn't being used for something else, can be set to an album that you have created on Amazon Photos. We loaded 400 or so photos, and they change at about one minute, which I think is a perfect time.<br/><br/>There are a couple of problems, though. First, the units have a tendency to stop and stay at one picture, until the unit is unplugged and plugged in again. This has been mentioned time and time again in reviews, but the Amazon team on this project has apparently either not prioritize it, or can't fix it. Expect this to continue until they make it a priority.<br/><br/>The second issue with this as a digital picture frame is that there's no customization, other than selecting the album. Pictures rotate chronologically, either by date taken or date uploaded. You cannot shuffle or randomize. So if you took a bunch of photos at a birthday party or wedding, you are going to see all of those pictures in succession, before it moves on to another. It's gotten to the point where I can predict what the next pictures going to be.<br/><br/>Also in the category of lack of customization – there is no effects that you can use with these pictures. There is no transition choice – fade,, wipe, side – nor were there any effects that can be used (Ken Burns, etc.) Amazon doesn't give you any kind of slideshow maker, and it doesn't support any third-party apps.<br/><br/>In the general category of Alexa – the skills have now become like Apple's app store. You can't find anything useful unless you read something about it somewhere. It suggests skills, based on one's you have already enabled. We tried that once. "Big sky" is a weather app that's pretty good. Around Christmas time, it was suggested that if we like that, we would like something called "Sky Weather". So I enabled it by voice. And then opened it. It went on for about two minutes. And Alexa did not appear to hear me calling for it to stop, so I had to scream. No more suggestions.<br/><br/>My home isn't smart enabled, so I'm not going to comment on its usefulness on that front. The recipes are definitely helpful, but I don't think I'll be watching much video on it. Simply finding your Amazon purchases can take time, and there's only a limited number of them that show. Finally, the "drop in". Nice idea, but these are usually going to be sitting on kitchen counters or side tables. You're going to have to squat down. In an age where everybody has an iPhone or iPad and Facetime is available, it's an inferior redundancy. (Oh, and it can be really annoying. I gave these to 2 sisters and a niece at Christmas. One of the sisters sent me a message. Suddenly, the Echo Dot next to my head started glowing and fading, glowing and fading. I couldn't figure out what the hell it was. So I could sleep, I just unplugged it. Next day, I saw other Dots glowing and fading, and went into the Show to find out what the heck was going on. Apparently it was the message, and it doesn't stop until you read it. Thanks, but I think I'll stick to texting.<br/><br/>They still haven't found the homerun app for this device. For us right now, it's pretty much a $229 picture frame that doesn't do everything we would like it to do.
 I enjoy using the All-new Echo Show (2nd Gen) I can now look at all my favorite recipes while I prepare them in the kitchen.  I can also listen to my favorite songs which are my two most favorite things to do.  The premium sound from the speaker is perfect and so is the screen size.  This is the best useful item I have purchased.  I am pleased with all that I can do with it.
 It was a big hit for Christmas, a nice addition to our Alexia family
 After a few months of use it remains to be good hardware with incomplete software.<br/><br/>Almost all of our content comes from Amazon and I would expect it to work easily. Trying to get a movie to play can sometimes take forever.<br/>"Alexa, play Rouge One"<br/>"Sorry, I cannot find any services that can play Rouge One, A Star Wars Story. Try managing you video apps on the Alexa app"<br/><br/>Constantly it will understand what you say but fail to get any content, whether movies or audio playlists. For a device that had a touchscreen it suggests you use the Alexa app on your phone almost half the time.<br/><br/>The home screen is annoying and there are a few volume issues where you might get really surprised when Alexa speaks with much greater volume than the content playing.<br/><br/>Bought two so we could let the kids video call my in-laws. Needing a smartphone besides mine too set that up was frustrating.<br/><br/>This makes the first "family" device that only makes sense to have on the kitchen counter. Profiles and multiple users are terrible and it can only learn one voice per user account.<br/><br/>Everything works great 20-30% of the time and it feels like a great purchase, but it's often frustrating. When we filled the house with the original echo we showed them off but this one is too buggy.
 Works well like all Alexa products, we love it for our ring door bell to monitor the going on at our front door.
 Outstanding speaker sound equivalent to $200+ speakers, so easy to setup. Outstanding multi  microphone desibn picks up talk from multiple people in room amazingly well, dropin and phone calling features great for keeping in touch with family and friends via video much better and easier than skype. Works well with connecting to anyone who has Alexa app on their Apple or Android phone or tablet. Using it frequently to connect with grandchildrdn eho have Apple phones
 Sound is a huge improvement over all other echos. Sounds great. Very full and deep bass. Get very loud. Screen is awesome and very useful for all kinds of things.
 Love the screen but needs update
 2 words “LOVE IT”. I’m still learning it but it plays my music and for that I am grateful!
 lot of capabilities. Havent explored too far in depth yet,  but much improved from the first version.
 Love love love! I purchased this for my Grandparents so we can video chat and it’s amazing! Highly recommend! Set-up was a breeze and the screen is big enough for them to see and use comfortably. They love the volume and how clear and crisp it is.<br/>Now I’m thinking about updating my current one to the model :-)
 The sound is incredible!
 Shocked when received, larger than expected. Great speaker, works awesome with ring doorbells, I love the drop in feature and use that a lot to talk to kids when away from home. Using this with Amazon Music is awesome as well. Our teens will turn that on when doing chores to have some fun while cleaning. The younger kids watch YouTube on it. Excellent product.
 Time and temperature display could be bigger. Day of the week (Thursday) could be displayed.
 At first I wasn't sure what use I have for this, but music in the kitchen is the #1 use and asking it the weather is the 2nd. Here and there we use it for some things, but it is redundant with your iPhone. Sound and picture is great.
 I love the new sound on this show, its got much deeper bass and all around sound. Be aware the majority of the speakers are rear facing, as the large screen takes up most of the front, but if you have a good bounce wall that its near, it makes for a full room sound. The screen is a very high resolution, and the additional features on it are great. The voice recognition and "listening" features catch your wake command and questions very easily. I would say its head an shoulders above the old show that I had. I'm glad I upgraded!
 It’s pricy but fantastic.
 The show doesn't do much for the money. I'm somewhat disappointed
 The echo show is very useful. It shows me calendar appointments, timers, and tips. Music is great too. The sound is an improvement over the 1st gen echo speaker.<br/><br/>The reason it doesn’t get 5 stars is because the processor is slow. When I am navigating through recipes or the main menu, it takes the show about 3 seconds to respond to each touch. You have to learn patience when interacting with the touch screen.
 I like everything about my Echo Show, how clear the picture and sound are, the quickness she answers my questions, the weather reports so far it has been all great, The entire family enjoys asking it questions It is worth the price.
 Tried using it with Skype but the image of me was black and white with lines. Anyone else? Any suggestions on how to fix this?
 The larger screen is great
 Excellent product. I have a first generation Echo Show and, while that version was very good, this version is much better.<br/>The larger screen size is a plus and the audio is superb. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to buying a product like this!
 What a phenomenal gift to stay in touch with parents.  Very nice screen size and excellent picture quality. The speakers are much better than previous Alexa products.  It also connects with security systems like the Ring and Blink.
 I love the echo show, but with me having lots of items in my kitchen, sometimes they end up in front of the device and it disables the microphone. It’s hard for the echo to hear me. Other than that, it’s a great device.
 It's ok. Xmas present from family.
 Music, information, and assistance
 This is a great product. We’ve had it for three weeks. Our main takeaways:<br/>- The power of this device is multiplied if you are already an Amazon prime/unlimited user. Even if you are not, I would seriously consider becoming one as a prime membership costs more or less the same than services that give you a similar access to media on other platforms, but also comes with free shipping for amazon items and other perks such as photo backups on amazon photo etc.<br/>- This device is amazing for music if you have a compatible subscription. Keep in mind that amazon prime already gives you access to many songs. With this device, when I subscribed to amazon music unlimited, an add on, it cost me 3.99/month (although that only gives you access to this service in this device). It can also connect your cell phone to play music you might have downloaded there, and is compatible with Apple Music. Sound quality is leaps and bounds ahead of competitors.<br/>- We also use it to get our daily news brief. You can select your sources and we play it as we are getting breakfast ready, very useful.<br/>- Has some other interesting uses, like coordinating shopping lists between multiple users through apps, as well as reminders and alarms.<br/>- Great for cooking as well with full integration with Allrecipes and other recipe skills.<br/>- It has some quirky interesting games as well, but this is not a defining feature for me.<br/>- One area where it lacks compared to some of the competition is trip/drive planning. I have deducted one star for this. There is no embedded map feature that I could find. Others have this. It will however tell you how long it will take you to get somewhere, but in my experience even this is a work in progress with times being shown differing from what my phone shows me.<br/>- Outisde of news videos, have not had a chance to test the movie feature. I have not seen a Netflix skill, although I have read Hulu is supported (have never tested it myself).<br/><br/>All in all, don’t regret the purchase at all.
 Loved using the phone option, another set of ideas for cooking recipes, the alarms are very easy to use as well.
 Exceeded expectations! Incredible sound quality!
 A little pricey considering it doesn't do much.  The touch screen doesn't have many options at all.  Most programming needs to be done with your phone.  Great sound.  Nice, heavy and sturdy so that it can't get knocked over easily.  Works good with my security system...however wish that the live camera feed would automatically show when it detects movements.  A split screen on my security cameras would be nice too.  I don't like amazon music as much as my other music app.  Some of the music titles they play in their stations aren't the #1 hits I want to listen to....some aren't desirable at all.  Still giving 4 stars because having my home controlled by Alexa is pretty cool.
 We Love it!!! Its been the BEST Birthday Present Ever for my husband🎁
 I got this as a Christmas gift from my daughter and have really enjoyed it.  It's easy to use and does well to provide a large viewing area of the room - it was easy to set up and is easy to use.  The speaker system on it is great as well.  I have been.<br/>enjoying this quite a bit - you can watch Hulu and look up recipes among other things.  I do wish it would allow three way calling so I can talk to both of my girls at the same time.  Maybe something that can be added later
 I don’t know how I ever lived without this I can’t say her name or she will go off right now but I love watching TV on it at night while my husband is sleeping next to me and with wireless headphones it is perfect.
 Better than the previous version! Nice screen quality, very responsive!
 Needs apps you can touch like the fire tablet.  No support for direct tv live.  Needs better integration with Ring.
 I liked the way my first Echo Show 2 was performing, so I got a second one. Now I  regret that I have two Echo Show 2 - they do not like to coexist:<br/>1. I have to select only one of the Echo devices to play music from Amazon Unlimited<br/>2. Smart zigbee devices are stuck with the first Echo show I had, and they cannot be controlled by the second Echo Show.<br/><br/>If you have only one Echo Show 2 device, it's great!
 Love it
 Have gen 1 and it was great waiting on 2nd gen now
 Love this
 The most superior Amazon smart home device to date!
 Perfect pruduct, perpect quality!!
 Absolutely love the Echo Show!  We purchased a first generation last year and bought this one as a gift for my parents.  They love it as well!  I can control the lights in my home by just asking Alexa to turn them on or off!  It works as an intercom system in your home as well if you have other wcho devices.  No more yelling downstairs for everyone to come to dinner!
 This is my favorite thing ever. So easy and fun to use. I use a lot of skills and cooking recipes. I don’t use it to skype or anything but it’s more fun than normal echo. I’d recommend if you love fun things for your house. I get lots of compliments from family from it too!
 Love it to skype with family
 I use this every day.  Got the music upgrade and love it.  Some of the apps (e.g., stopwatches) are not ready for prime time.
 I love the new Echo Show so much that I am giving my old ones to family just for an excuse to buy the new ones
 Our home feels like an Alexa home, this and other Alexa enabled products work well together. I have one of the echos in my kitchen. It gives me hands free recipes i can read and music, movies,  tv show, ect. We also have reminders set on it.
 Amazing sound. Will say that sometimes she tends to struggle at recognizing call word “Alexa”. But overall big upgrade From previous model
 Works great.
 Love the product, only issue is the video chat is limited which stinks
 quick shipping, bought as gift, looks perfect
 I got this to use with my ring doorbell 2 works perfect love it
 I now have 2 echo shows and 4 dots  All fantastic. But I love the new echo show 2nd generation. What a great size screen and again so easy to set up.
 Works great. I love Alexa
