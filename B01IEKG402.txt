 This is the second drive I've had same issue. There's a persistent clicking during idle you can hear, and even feel if you put your hand on the case of your pc closest to the driver enclosure/mounting point. Happens every 3-4 seconds, and will not go away. I've tried everything that has been suggested, ran the SeaTools long test which stops the clicking for the 17 hour duration, but it comes back immediately afterwards. I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary, just trying to get this drive to be a decent mass storage for media in my PC. Connected to a power supply with wattage to spare, then a sata cable straight to my motherboard. Hell, I even have a regular 3TB barracuda drive that works perfectly and is silent.<br/><br/>Worst part is when I decided to contact SeaGate customer service, I gave them the serial number of the drive, and received two different emails telling me it "is an internal component of the external hard drive" without explaining what that actually means in context of my issue. The second of the two emails then informed me that because of this fact, they aren't able to act on the warranty. Now let me tell you right now, this drive was sold directly from Amazon, and I'm aware some people do sketchy returns, but this came in sealed OEM packaging, it was unopened, was not formatted, had the right amount of space, and the label was pristine and untouched. So if there's any fault here in terms of it somehow being the wrong item, I'm willing to put that on Seagate. That said, so the five year warranty these drives come with? Try one weekend and Seagate is telling me they're not going to honor it. Faaaaaantastic.<br/><br/>EDIT: I've received further clarification from Seagate that apparently the drive was never meant to be sold and was intended to be used inside a an external enclosure. This of course makes no sense as like I previously stated, the drive was factory sealed. Nevertheless, be forewarned, apparently, by Seagate's own words, you're not supposed to be buying these drives. If you have any issues with them, you better hope that they appear within the Amazon 30 day return window, because chances are Seagate's going to claim these were never meant to be sold and not honor your warranty.
 I saw some of the other reviews mentioning that this wasn't under warranty and thought they might have gotten a bum shipment, but I can confirm that mine is the same.  I went to seagate's warranty checker and it said this drive was sold as part of a system so you can forget about getting that 3 year seagate warranty if you buy this drive.<br/><br/>From research other sellers have done, these appear to be ripped out of cheap 8tb external seagate enclosures.  These enclosures only have a 1 year warranty as opposed to a 3 year warranty like a barracuda drive sold for desktop use, but I you won't even get that from seagate because it was taken out of the enclosure.<br/><br/>This makes me think Seagate is doing something a little shady.  They probably have some way of detecting barracuda drives that aren't up to specs, so they ship them in an external enclosure with a limited warranty because they don't EXPECT them to last 3 years, and because external drives generally are used a lot less than an internal hard drive.  This seller is doing something very shady by clearly posting the 3 year warranty on the item page when Seagate won't honor it.<br/><br/>So if you buy this, expect it to fail.  And don't expect to get any support when it does.
 This hard drive was the worst I've ever owned. The read speeds seemed slow which was acceptable, and I experienced a whole bunch of strange problems since I started using it: my virtual machines ran slow, my games would offload alot of caching onto CPU, and some applications would freeze when doing an intensive read. I didn't realize it was the drive until I ran Seagate's diagnostic tool on it and found it was failing after less than a year. After I replaced it, all the tasks above were back to normal. The first and LAST Seagate I will ever buy. Pay the extra 30-50 bucks and go with Western Digital.
 These are repurposed and/or used drives that have already been registered at Seagate.com.  This borders on Fraud and will be reported to the TexasAG Office.  Three of the drives have warranty periods ending 4 months before the purchase and the other 2 months before the purchased.  No reason to register a drive not in use; hence, these drives are sold as new; however they are clearly used.
 Bought it direct from Amazon and the drive came packaged very well. I installed the drive and ran a extended surface test on it which took about 4 1/2 hrs. The drive passed the test with no errors. Hopefully i can get 5 yrs of good use out of it before replacing it with another new unit. I will update this if any issues arise but so far so good.<br/><br/>One thing to note, When i installed the drive it had no active partition out of the box thus it will not show up on windows explorer until you look under disk management, devices or look under diskpart in the command prompt to see in fact that the drive is being detected but isn't active with a partition. This will make someone who doesn't know much about computers think the drive doesn't work and i've seen a lot of reviews where people say the drive didn't show up when they hooked it up and thinking it was broken. Reason being that you need to format and create a partition for the drive to become active. Here's the simple steps to make it happen on Windows 10 which is what OS i use this drive on for media storage.<br/><br/>01 - Open command prompt in Windows 10 by pressing Winkey+S<br/><br/>02 - Type CMD in search box and right click Command Prompt to run as Administrator.<br/><br/>03 - Now when in the Command Prompt type "DISKPART" (without quotes) and hit Enter.<br/><br/>04 - Type "LIST DISK" (without quotes) and hit Enter.<br/><br/>05 - A numbered list will now show with all the drives that are attached to the system. Simply identify the number of the new Seagate drive in this list and make sure you choose the right drive or you could wipe out data on an existing drive with data. If your unsure then you could turn your PC off and unplug any existing drives with data on them, leave your main system drive and your new Seagate drive attached to the PC. Then boot your PC back up and repeat the steps back up to this point and continue on with the listed steps.<br/><br/>06 - After identifying the disk number, type  "SELECT DISK 0" (without quotes and also replace 0 with the number that your drive identifies with in the command prompt, i only used 0 as an example.) and hit Enter.<br/><br/>07 - After you've made your selection type "CLEAN" (without quotes) and hit Enter.<br/><br/>08 - Type "CREATE PARTITION PRIMARY " (without quotes) and hit Enter.<br/><br/>09 - Type "SELECT PARTITION 1" (without quotes) and hit Enter.<br/><br/>10 - Type "ACTIVE" (without quotes) and hit Enter.<br/><br/>11 - Type the following command to format the partition using NTFS and to set a label "FORMAT FS=NTFS LABEL=SG-Drive QUICK " (without quotes) and hit Enter. Remember to change the SG-Drive in the command with the drive name you want to use.<br/><br/>12 - Almost home now. Now you can choose what letter you want your drive to show up as in windows. Type "ASSIGN LETTER=F" (without quotes and use whatever letter you want, i used F for example, just make sure another drive isn't already using the letter you chose.) and hit Enter.<br/><br/>13 - Type "EXIT" (without quotes) and hit Enter. Close the command prompt.<br/><br/>14 - Turn your PC back off and plug back in any drives that you unplugged earlier as a way to prevent wiping the data on them by mistake.<br/><br/>-----&gt;  Hope this helped someone out there. Enjoy your new drive  &lt;------
 Pay very close attention to the drive you receive. At first I just blindly opened the box and installed the drive but grew suspicious when I saw the rotational speed numbers were too low. Although the product box had a sticker slapped on it that said it was a BarraCuda Pro, it was only the standard model. Look closely at the model number on the drive when you open it: ST8000DM004 is the standard model while ST8000DM0004 (NOTE THE EXTRA 0) is the Pro model.
 1 star equals the amount of drives that worked. DO NOT OVERLOOK THE OTHER BAD REVIEWS!!<br/><br/> I ordered 4, and had to RMA 3 of them. 3 of the 4 drives shipped had over 8500 bad blocks on each of the drives. During a parity/consistancy check before building my NAS, it detected errors on 3 drives. Using two different Synology 4 bay NAS (RS816 and DS416) devices, and both found the same.<br/><br/>Amazon has an amazing RMA/return/replacement process for these, and i was able to get drives sent next day which was very nice. It took lots of troubleshooting with my NAS and several hours/days of my time which i'm not too happy about.<br/><br/>So far the replacement drives are all looking healthy. I'm questioning the longevity of these drives.
 I was asked to answer a question about this drive, which I did, so I thought I should review the drive.  I purchased my drive from Oceanside store fulfilled by amazon.  The hard drive I received did not have "pro" on the label (the photo on the original listing had a photo of a barracuda pro drive), so I looked it up at Seagate.com- I used the Seagate app (available on their site) to see drive specifications. The drive serial # is for an 8tb drive originally installed in a Seagate external enclosure, Seagate Expansion 8TB Desktop External Hard Drive USB 3.0 (STEB8000100) now $169.99  &amp; FREE Shipping on amazon. There are video's online with instruction on how to remove drive from the enclosure.  The specs looked very much the same as the 8tb pro, so I installed in my computer and it initialized fine and shows up as an 8tb drive, and is quiet. I read a lot online about a market for these drives removed from the enclosures because those drives are much cheaper than the internal drives. I am miffed and feel the drive is not as advertised, but I kept it installed because a new drive is always a crap shoot, no matter what drive it is, and it is such a pain to return it.  I gave it a 3 rating because it is an 8tb Seagate drive with good specs at a good price, and seems to be working fine (so far), but it does not come with the 5 year warranty or the "pro" guarantee.
 PROS:<br/>- Fast<br/>- Quiet<br/>- Affordable<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- Have to RMA my drive after only 3 months. Read below for details and updates.<br/><br/>I purchased this Hard Drive at the end of August 2017. So I've owned it for a little over three months as of the date of this writing. This is the first time I've bought a Seagate drive for my personal build in exactly 10 years. I have mostly used Western Digital drives in builds because I bought into the mindshare many years ago that they were somehow better. After having a less than enjoyable experience with WD's reliability and customer service, I decided to come back for a cheap 1TB drive.<br/><br/>I pride myself on a quiet gaming computer and usually keep it running 24/7. After about 2 and a half months or so, I would be sitting probably 2-3 feet away and I began to hear a faint but distinct clicking noise come from my computer every 15-30 seconds. This drive is used strictly for storage of files, photos, videos, etc. The OS resides on an SSD and there are no programs installed on this drive. I know this "tick" noise all too well, and it sounds much like a clicking noise that a dead hard drive would make. Nonetheless the drive works flawlessly, reads and writes fast, and makes almost no noise during regular operation. I thought nothing of it. After two weeks, the tick started to annoy me slightly, and I also began to get worried about the reliability of the drive. The sound it makes is definitely not normal. So I downloaded SeaTools and ran some tests. Every test passed but I decided to contact Seagate support anyways.<br/><br/>11/26/2017 - I contacted Seagate support. This day is a Sunday.<br/>11/27/2017 - I received a rather generic support response, claiming that the noise is most likely normal, but out of precaution to run some tests using SeaTools for DOS (loaded on a bootable USB drive). On the same day, I created the bootable USB drive and attempted to run the recommended tests. But for some reason, my Keyboard and Mouse don't work with Bootable USB drives that well. I decided to record the noise and send it in my update, as well as inform them of my inability to run the tests outside of the Operating System.<br/>11/28/2017 - Support contacted me again stating that the sound clip of the noise I sent them was "disturbing" and recommended I RMA the drive at once.<br/><br/>The RMA process is pretty straight forward, but as I expected they want you to send the drive back first before they send you out a new one. This was not an option for me, so I had to pay ~$12 for them to send me a replacement first. The replacement was shipped the day after I filed for the RMA and will arrive via UPS tomorrow (12/6/2017, so exactly a week).<br/><br/>Overall: The drive is quiet and fast when operating normally. I must've gotten a defective drive and after a much better experience with Seagate's support versus their competitors, I'll be going with them again in the future. The drive performs quite well, especially when you factor in the price. so I've only docked 1 star for the fact that they expect people to back up potentially terabytes of data to send in a defective drive. Expect more updates to come.<br/><br/>UPDATE 12/19/2017 - Received my refurbished drive approximately two weeks ago. This one is made in China, not Malaysia like the original. Interesting. It also doesn't have the cool Green/White/Black sticker on it. BUT what it does do is operate just as fast as the other one and makes no clicking noises, even when being written to or read from. Seagate just received my defective unit as of today and closed the case. Customer Support was courteous and acted swiftly to replace my drive. I'm a little bitter that it cost me $12 to send them a new HDD in advance, but I'm also grateful they didn't drag out the troubleshooting process on what was obviously a defective unit. Remains 4/5 stars.<br/><br/>2nd UPDATE 2/4/2019 - The replacement drive mentioned above has started making constant ticking noises ("The Click of Death"). For now the drive can still be written to and read from (albeit slowly), but the noises that it makes are horrendous. Sounds like the arm is fighting against itself whenever it needs to sweep across the disk.  This is a re-certified / refurbished disk, so I'm a little surprised this is happening again. I have to shell out another $12 to get a replacement shipped to me again. At this point, I'm going to consider snagging a 1TB SSD and just accepting the high cost. I haven't had an SSD fail on me ever, but I've somehow had two HDDs fail on me in less than two years. Docking another star.
 I purchased 2 of these.  One failed in under a week.  First it started periodically dropping out of the Windows explorer.  Then it got into the infamous "click" mode, continually re-initializing itself.  At last it disappeared entirely, actually locking up computer startup.<br/><br/>It's not impressive at all that a drive used only for backups every couple days cannot survive a week.<br/><br/>The second drive has (thus far) continued to work.  I used it in an external USB enclosure as an additional backup drive.  I had to try 2 brands of enclosure before the drive would reliably stay connected.  Again, not impressive.<br/><br/>I went out and bought 2 Western Digital drives.  The manufacturer may be the same, but I've had no problems with WD drives.
 Replaced my previously failed Seagate with this 8tb Barracuda.  The 8tb failed within only 5 days of installation.  Drive will only read, and is unable to write new data without stalling, making some noise, and stops responding all together.<br/><br/>I read the reviews and was glad to see that over 20 percent of reviewers gave this product a 1 star.  Head that warning, I should have.  Thankfully Amazon will return defective items within 30 days.  I think this may be my last Seagate product.
 I honestly felt like I was taking a gamble with this hard drive since there were some reported QC issues. Luckily, my hard drive appears to be working fine. No funky noises or vibrations. Hard drive runs cool and quiet as far as HDDs go (it's not an SSD). I'm mostly including this review as another data point so people know that some of the hard drives do actually work!<br/><br/>Attached is a benchmark for added substance.
 I ordered these on 09 May 2018 and I received the same type of drive as in Amazon's photo.  When I ordered, the drives were shipped and sold by Amazon.  I wanted to make this clear, as I saw several reviews stating that the drive you will receive, should you order one, will be a drive that was pulled out of an external hard drive enclosure system.<br/><br/>However I did receive one drive in a box that had already had its label cut open, but the anti-static bag around the hard drive was intact.  Also, the date of manufacture (DOM) on the hard drive labels is older than on the labels on the box.<br/><br/>I ordered 2 of these drives and set them up in a RAID 1 array (mirror) using IRST, and it is satisfyingly fast for a set of mirrored 8TB 3.5" drives.  I copied 3.83TB of data from my single 8TB archive HDD that I pulled out of an external HDD enclosure that I used with my laptop to this new RAID array.  The process maintained transfer speeds of around 170MB/s, maintaining a lower rate for smaller files and a higher rate for larger files.  According to task manager, the process was mostly limited by the read speed of the archive HDD.  This is as fast as I need, and this should be the largest amount of data I need to transfer to the drives for a long, long time.
 Received the 4TB ST4000DB004 (aka ST4000DMB04) drive today, installed, and registered with Seagate.<br/>The drive is new, and warranty is good until 2020. No new firmware is available (4/7/2018)<br/>Found the drive specifications on Seagate's website, answering the question of spindle speed (5400 RPM). The drive is quiet and running cool so far. I'll be running benchmarks and stress tests to ensure stability.<br/><br/>I will follow up this review as time goes on.<br/><br/>Drive Specifications<br/>Product Brand  Seagate<br/>Model Number  ST4000DMB04<br/>Part Number (PN)  2GXABM-570<br/>Marketing Name  BARRACUDA35<br/>Family  BARRACUDA35<br/>Interface  SATA<br/>Encryption Type  NO ENCRYPTION<br/>Capacity  4000 GB<br/>Form Factor  3.5<br/>Product Type  DRIVE<br/>Market Segment  Personal Compute<br/>Sub-market Segment  Desktop Storage<br/>Application Segment  DS Mainstream<br/>Performance<br/>Cache Size (MB)  256<br/>Spindle Speed  5400<br/>Interface Transfer Rate  6<br/>Access Time  12.5<br/>Physical<br/>Sector Size  512E<br/>Number of Heads  4<br/>Number of Disks  2<br/>Height  20MM<br/>Weight  .65 KG<br/>Zero G Sensor  N
 I ended up purchasing this drive after I received a defective and then poor performing replacement Firecuda 2TB. I was prepared to be disappointed after replacing my Caviar Black. I have to say while it is about 20 Mbps slower than the Caviar it is still very fast and very quiet, especially compared to the noisy WD drive. The 4K perfomance is pretty dismal, but in real world use I just don't see much difference. I am a gamer and use my PC as a small office server. So it is very fast with a Samsung EVO 850 primary drive, OCed 3570K, GTX 1060, Crucial Ballistex memory etc. The Caviar is clearly the best mechanical drive out there but at twice the price per MB I'm not sure it is worth the price. I guess the proof will be in the durablity and the drive does get warm with long and large data transfers.<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>CrystalDiskMark 5.1.2 x64 (C) 2007-2016 hiyohiyo<br/>  Crystal Dew World : http://crystalmark.info/<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>* MB/s = 1,000,000 bytes/s  SATA/600 = 600,000,000 bytes/s]<br/>* KB = 1000 bytes, KiB = 1024 bytes<br/>  Sequential Read (Q= 32,T= 1) :  148.946 MB/s<br/>  Sequential Write (Q= 32,T= 1) :  111.386 MB/s<br/>  Random Read 4KiB (Q= 32,T= 1) :  1.866 MB/s    455.6 IOPS]<br/> Random Write 4KiB (Q= 32,T= 1) :  1.163 MB/s    283.9 IOPS]<br/>  Sequential Read (T= 1) :  147.841 MB/s<br/>  Sequential Write (T= 1) :  126.389 MB/s<br/>  Random Read 4KiB (Q= 1,T= 1) :  0.834 MB/s    203.6 IOPS]<br/>  Random Write 4KiB (Q= 1,T= 1) :  1.283 MB/s    313.2 IOPS]<br/>  Test : 100 MiB  E: 7.1% (45.0/634.7 GiB)] (x3)   Interval=5 sec]<br/>  Date : 2016/11/14 14:22:50<br/>  OS : Windows 10   10.0 Build 14393] (x64)
 Seagate faces class-action lawsuit over 3TB hard drive failure rates with the ST3000DM001 in 2016! The failure rate of these drives was like 34%. Got mine today, and I immediately asked for a replacement or refund.
 Bought two for a mirrored pair.  At least one was still working after 60 days, the is the RMA.  At least the RMA process was reasonably easy. One whole about 50% happy.  hopefully, the one was the bad one of the pair and the new one will hold up,but we shall see.<br/>Got the RMA unit is back and now after a whopping 10 or so days in service the RMA replacement has also bit the proverbial big one.  I had lived by the motto "skip the Seagate drives" for a long time, but got a 3TB drive as a gift and it seemed okay (and so far is alive and kicking), but these 4TB drives are rather appearing as pretty much crap so far with a survival average of just 33%.  Yikes.  I'll give the benefit of the doubt and try one more RMA and hope that is works correctly, but I am not really enthused and the likelihood.<br/>UPDATE 09/21/2018 - FAILED AGAIN..  3TB is still good and the other 4TB Seagate seems to be doing well, but the second replacement 4TB has crapped out again.  Wish it were possible to give a rating lower than 1 star - perhaps ZERO should be an option<br/>UPDATE 02/18/2019, 3TB and 4TB #1 still working okay.  The other 4TB is now on the third RMA and the replacement "Recertified" drive lasted under 90 minutes before quitting.  I am giving up on Seagate for good.  Love my WD 4TB drives - 2 running for tears now without a hiccup on this system, 2 other WD 1 TB drives at more than 8 years now without issues.  WD here I come.
 I heard rumors that seagate drives used to fail a whole lot but mine hasn't so far and I'll make sure to update this review if it does. I was told they fixed the problems though. The chart attached is by Backblaze. March-2017
 I just got this drive and it took me 4 hours to install it.  I won't bore you with the details of all the steps I took (trying to install this drive through Windows, calling customer support, installing SeaTools for Windows, which they requested, which crashed Windows in both normal and Safe Mode, installing bootable SeaTools, which uses command prompt), but will go to the solution that worked for me.  Download Disc Wizard and use Add New Disk tool from it.  That's it.  Everything worked fine.  Also, before installing the disk take a picture of the front panel - customer support will not talk to you without the serial number, and the only way to get to it once the disk is in the computer is through SeaTools, which crashes your Windows.<br/><br/>As far as clicking sounds, they are there, not too loud, but you can hear them.  I wouldn't recommend this drive for those who want a quiet machine.<br/><br/>Shame on you, Seagate for not providing instructions on how to install the hard drive!  Shame on you for not debugging your software!  Shame on you for the terrible untrained customer support from another country!
 The important thing to know about the 2TB Seagate ST2000DM006 and similar drives is that they come with the Seagate flavor of APM (Advanced Power Management), however, they are approximately half the price of equivalent Western Digital 2TB drives.  I almost never buy anything but a Western Digital drive, however, I consider Seagate equivalent to Western Digital in quality, it's just that there are different things to know about them.  This drive is a great deal at $60 but you if you are not already familiar with APM, you need to read up on it before making a purchase.  Keep in mind that Windows has a habit of accessing drives behind the scenes even when you think it is idle.<br/><br/>The big thing you need to decide is if you are ok with your drive repeatedly spinning up and down due to the automatic APM setting the drive comes with.  If you do not believe that using APM wears your drive out prematurely from excessive parking of the head and spinning up the spindle, you need read no further, this drive is a great buy.  If you are like me and have no use for a drive with APM enabled, make sure you are up for what it appears to take to disable it permanently.  It is easier to do this permanently on Western Digital drives (WDIDLE3 utility), Seagate makes it very, very difficult.<br/><br/>Here's what I had to go through to disable APM on this drive.  But first, before we get to the APM part, please note that the drive kept freezing and I could not get it to format using NTFS full format as opposed to quick format on Windows 7.  It kept hanging, first at 2-3% and then at 48%.  I eventually isolated the drive and tried to format it using the Windows 7 installation disk, it failed too.  I was about to RMA the thing when I decided to go under the hood to DOS and run the DRIVPARM utility manually.  First thing I did, and I think this may have been the key step, I ran the CLEAN command to wipe the drive.  Sure enough, I was then able to create a partition, make it active, and low level format the drive as NTFS without any trouble.  It now appears to be operating in good order.<br/><br/>However, APM was still engaged and kept spinning the drive down.  The Crystal Disk Info utility was able to change the APM setting to off but it could not do it permanently and I kept having to run it again at every boot.  So I did some research and found the URL below that pointed me to the HDAT2 utility (hdat2.com) so I downloaded the .iso file and burned it to a CD to create a HDAT2 boot disk and then followed the procedures given in the URL below to disable APM.<br/><br/>Then things got messy as I was one of the unlucky ones whose motherboard or whatever locks the APM changes from being written to the hard disk.  I could disable APM but I couldn't save the changes.  However, the workaround worked for me, your mileage may vary so consider what I had to do to make it work for me.<br/><br/>First, I booted from the HDAT2 disk and at the BIOS screen, interrupted the boot sequence and selected the option to select my boot device/drive.  Fortunately, the Seagate drive was correctly displayed there.  I then got into the computer chassis and manually pulled the power cable off the Seagate drive, waited a minute, and then reconnected it.  Thankfully for me, the BIOS let me get away with this and still recognized the drive, however, the power off and then on cycle apparently disabled the lock that the motherboard put on the drive when it first loaded the drive.  I then performed the procedures to disable the APM again and this time I was able to save them.  After dozens of reboots, Crystal Disk Info is still reporting that the APM is off on the Seagate drive.<br/><br/>Lot of work, and maybe a lot of luck too, eh?<br/><br/>Here's the URL with the procedures:<br/>https://forum.hddguru.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=32044<br/><br/>On the plus side, note that there are problems with the 2TB Western Digital drives that are priced in the $60 range, most of them are either used or not correctly identified as having variable speed rpm Intellipower which constantly spins the drive between 5400 rpm and 7200 rpm.  As best I can tell, you have to give around $120 to get a true 7200 rpm Western Digital drive that is equivalent to this Seagate $60 drive once you disable the APM.<br/><br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Seagate-2TB-BarraCuda-SATA-6Gb-s-64MB-Cache-3-5-Inch-Internal-Hard-Drive-ST2000DM006/dp/B01IEKG402/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Seagate 2TB BarraCuda SATA 6Gb/s 64MB Cache 3.5-Inch Internal Hard Drive (ST2000DM006)</a>
 I chose this product because the description said it was a 7200 RPM drive. As you can see by the picture I have uploaded it is only a 5400 RPM drive.

 I've been saving up to purchase parts for a custom build. I purchased this hd back in December. Upon installation there were problems.<br/><br/>The hd has more that 4 gig of unusable space and has to be partitioned. Because I had to buy one piece at a time, my warranty is expired.<br/><br/>I understand that it's a crap shoot when it comes to computer parts, but this is supposed to be a brand new hd. Seagate has a decent reputation when it comes to hd's which is why this surprised me.<br/><br/>I won't buy parts here anymore, I'll utilize my local Micro Center. At least their parts are sold as advertised. Not refurbished sold as NEW. Which is fraud and false advertising at the least.
 First off this is the second Seagate BarraCuda I Have owned in the past 2 years, And they seem to FAIL the same way.<br/>The computer ether wont start (if this is your primary disk) or the disk doesn't show up (if this is Your secondary disk).<br/>upon scanning you'll bad sectors and files will become defective.<br/>When you try to go to there website and try to get help, and/or a replacement, the serial number that you put in ether from the label or there DriveDetect.exe software, will come back as (Serial Number Unknown.)???<br/>you can not e-mail or call because the site will send you on that dreaded.(dead end loop).<br/>So ether AMAZON or SEAGATE is selling these Hard Drives with Unknown Serial Numbers.That will keep you from<br/>GETTING The Assistance you need When they go bad, AND THEY WILL GO BAD.<br/>SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE BUY (TOSHIBA, OR WD Blue) NOTE; The images are from my second hard drive, the first one was unusable to the point of not being able to test with my disk checking software. the warrenty runs out feb. 2019 and it looks as if I'm SOL again !!!
 My Seagate Desktop HDD 2TB internal hard drive which made in China was very quite.  After replacing it with Seagate BarraCuda Pro 8TB Internal hard drive on 6/20/2018, new HD works fine.  However it makes continue loud clicking noise.  Therefore replacing the 8TB BarrraCuda Pro with a new one on 7/1/2018.  The second 8TB BarraCuda Pro hard drive didn't make clicking noise, but making loud grinding noise.  After talking with Seagate tech support, they ask me to try 3rd one.  All of these three 8TB BarraCuda Pro hard drive are made in Thailand in June 2018.  The third BarraCuda Pro 8TB internal hard drive has same loud grinding noise.  I am very disappointed for the quality of the Seagate's hard drive.  I had attached a recording for your own judgement. (https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/share/YHbWB6nmHdoRt8yZE8SbdpcZeaiJh2k5TpSFvPQZi2J)  Please note that: From 3:06" desktop starts to run Random Write 4KiB of CrystalDiskMark.<br/><br/>It is ST8000DM0004 drive, not ST8000DM005 because 8TB BarraCuda Pro has two models.<br/><br/>Seagate should showcase their solid hard drive to change customers' view by sending them a great one.<br/><br/>7/24 Update:<br/>When size of hard drive increases from 1 TB to 8TB, reading heads increased too.  Thus noice increased (usually 2TB hard drive has 6 heads).  Because ST8000DM0004 hard drive has 14 heads, it has constant grinding noice specially in quiet office environment.  My colleague said to me that you are grinding coffee beans.<br/><br/>ST8000NM0055 hard drive has only 12 heads, therefore it has relative lower noice.  Both hard drive have same 5 years warranty.  Based on Seagate's specification, the difference is that ST8000NM0055 has 0.44% annualized failure rate while ST8000DM0004 has 1% annualized failure rate.<br/><br/>One thing I noticed that the temperature of ST8000NM0055 and ST8000DM0004 are 48C and 41C respectively.
 I am hopeful that I will be editing this review tomorrow when my replacements come in, but 2 of 3 of these purchased so far have resulted in massive failure.  I know I know failures usually tend to show in batches, SO I am very hopeful I just caught a bad batch.  I run a large ZFS array of drives, with a mixture of seagate and WD, and one seagate (purchased a month before other two) and all the WDs are churning along great.  While one seagate drive has completely failed, and the other threw 500+ read/write (each) errors within the first few hours of data xfer.  Amazon as always was fantastic to get out replacements that I will have tomorrow.  If these new ones work properly I will edit the review to reflect the findings.  I wont slaughter a review because of issues like this, I know its happened to pretty much every product ever made.  Especially at these levels of quantity.  Problems are bound to happen.  I only say this to warm others, DONT TRUST the data you put on these drives til you have them burned in for weeks or months.  Personally I never trust my data in only one location anyways... But whenever possible, always buy staggered, and always triple check the validity of the data.
 Lets be real, if you have a low capacity SSD around 120gb or less odds are you have run into the problem of running out of space, now one could but another SSD or even a bigger one, but SSDs at the moment are pretty expensive, so what's a great alternative? A HDD of course!<br/><br/>Now over the years Seagate has been stepping up their hard drive game, less failures and more durability is absolutely great, since other hard drive manufactures have been on the decline of failure rates and durability, I had to go with Seagate on this one.<br/><br/>My last Seagate drive was a 1tb 5500 rpm drive, it was really noisy but I got that one about 10 years or so ago, so how much has Seagate improve in 10 years? A lot, seriously they did their research, this drive is really quiet, for 2tb I expected a noisy drive but its very quiet, and performs very well too, compared to one of my other computers that has a 1tb WD Blue drive, I have to say I prefer the 2tb Barracuda by a long shot, it makes very little noise and I don't think there is virtually any spin up time at all, it just works.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend anyone who has been using any other drive oem to just give Seagate another try, this drive proves they did their research and designed a solid HDD, I'm sure it will last a long time too.
 This is not an internal hard drive. It is in fact a hard drive someone has taken out of an external enclosure and has resold it. I thought something was fishy when it came in an opened static bag. Seatools shows it as an external drive by the serial number. I should’ve returned it the day it came but decided to keep it. Now it’s failing and I am 90 days out. So nearly $200 down the toilet.
 Ok...not only am I running an 8-drive array (34-TB) full of Seagates, but have to say that without a doubt, there are NO DRIVES that compare to them in durability!<br/>I've seen the stats, heard the hype, but then again, I've also moved PETABYTES across them for years, and have only had ONE drive failure in all that time! The problem with 'testing and reporting' is that no one reports 'success rates', and the drives that last for years if not decades never make the news...<br/>I won't buy another brand...and Seagate can bank on that from a VERY dedicated customer!
 Seagate has had a history with poor reliability with their drives. It seems that hasn't changed. I figured I would purchase this and give Seagate another go since it has been years since I have heard about the issues with reliability, but apparently its still a thing. Purchased this drive in September 2018, and here December 11th, the drive fails pretty dramatically on me. Not only did I lose 1.5TB of projects (luckily for me most are remotely stored as well, still a pain though), but it didn't fail by simply disappearing, it wouldn't let me boot windows. Programs stopped opening at first, then I rebooted and no longer could get through windows loading. Attempting to load from a USB was dramatically slower as well. Got into windows installer, wiped my OS but couldn't write to my drive (only clean it). Keep in mind, this is a different drive altogether.  After unplugging that drive, I could install windows (USB loaded up immediately as well). Plugging it back in after reinstalling, couldn't use my USB devices anymore. Then plugged it in after windows loaded and simply wouldn't pull up the drive. ALso attempted another cable. Others drives still work.<br/><br/>TL:DR version, don't buy these.
 The drive I received was 5900 RPM, not the 7200 RPM that is shown on the product page. It was in a taped (not sealed) bag. Further, the drive had files on it that indicated it was some kind of backup drive. Based on other reviews, I tried to check warranty status on Seagate and got "Warranty Validation Error". I've contacted the seller but want to pass along the warning that this doesn't appear to be a factory sealed ST8000DM004, but a drive that was part of a Seagate external backup.
 Out of all the hard drives I have ever used this is the only one has failed before even a year of use it. Died within 6 months of being used almost like it was designed to look like it was working for that long and then give it up. Even before it died for good the signs were all too clear within 3 months of being used everytime I turned on the computer Windows said it had to run diagnostic and repair on this sorry excuse for a hard disk. I decided to give seagate a chance after hearing nothing but bad things and I regret it. I understand hardware failure is a potential for any device but this is asinine close monitoring using diagnostic programs and it never detected anything and then one day it just catastrophically fails. Take my advice I've had Western Digitals and Toshiba hard drives that have been working for nearly a decade and in 1 WD case over a decade. Don't skimp out on buying a better drive otherwise you run the risk of being like me, too poor to replace a dead worthless hunk of garbage. I can't even comment good things about when it did work because I feel the write speed and data transfer rates were just lies fabricated to sell these sorry bricks because it sure as hell didn't run at rates advertised.
 I've been using two the 6TB Pro drives for a couple of weeks. Originally I had a problem getting them to be recognized, but finally got them formatted and striped into a  raid configuration. I'm using a Startech external dock that has a USB 3.1 Gen 2 connection (10GB/PS), but am plugging it into a standard usb 3.0 port on my Macbook Pro. I really don't think I'll get any faster speeds than what I'm getting via USB 3.0.<br/><br/>The drives are fast when striped together. I've included pictures of a black magic speed test using the new Pro drives and with a pair of older seagate Barracuda 1.5TB drives striped using Raid 0. The new drives are getting ~380 MB/s while the old ones are getting ~210-220MB/s. That's almost twice as fast.<br/><br/>Interestingly, running the old Seagate drives in a Vantec Nexstar Sata III/USB 3.0 dock, I'm not getting the same speeds. With eSata to a Lacie Thunderbolt 2 hub, I got 166MB/s write and 215MB/s read. With USB 3.0 and the old Barracuda drives, I got 207MB/s write and 211MB/s read.  With the new Seagate Pro drives, running USB 3.0, I got 234MB/s write and 236MB/s read.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>I have noticed that the drives can get noisy like some others mentioned, but the most alarming problem is that every once in a while, the drives let out a loud POP sound.  It's like the sound an ice cube makes in a drink when it suddenly cracks.  It has happened when the drive bay is powered on but they go idle, but also sometime after I've turned the drive bay off. I live in a studio with my desk next to my bed, and a couple of times I shut everything down, turned off all the lights and went to bed, was almost asleep when POP! The noise was enough to freak me out and wonder WTF made it.  I suspected the drives and sure enough, it has happened a couple of times after the drives have spun down to idle.<br/><br/>This makes me worry. I am using them for video editing and while I need to back up regularly, I don't want to lose potentially a whole day's work or more. I will probably be sending these back to Amazon.
 really fast, great for porn
 I have an SSD for my OS and all of my programs so this drive is being used for media storage (mostly movies). I probably didn't need a 7200 rpm drive but I don't remember the last drive that I bought that was less than 7200. I decided to spend the extra money over the 5400 rpm version because I wanted faster transfer speeds, a better warranty and the price was still reasonable.<br/>I am pleased with the drive's performance and the noise when it is in use is what I would expect, BUT for some reason this hard drive is loudest when it is idle. I contacted Seagate regarding the idle noise and they stated that the drive should not be making noise when it is idle. They suggested that I exchange it for a new one. I was hesitant to exchange after reading about this issue on the internet but went through with it anyways.<br/>The exchange process with Amazon was very easy. I now have the 2nd hard drive and it is exactly the same as the first one. In my opinion an idle hard drive should not have a noise that can be heard from 10 feet away. Although Seagate was easy to get in touch with with and very pleasant they appear to be either unaware of or not acknowledging an issue with this hard drive.<br/>I think I will keep the drive, but only because I do not want to go though the process of moving all that data again, and I have installed a small program that writes a very small .txt file to the drive at a predetermined frequency keeping the drive from going to idle state and therefore not too noisy. I really wanted to like this drive as the performance and warranty is great, but I can't understand how or why something can be more noisy when idle than when working. It is by far the loudest hard drive that I have ever used and unfortunately would not buy again. Hopefully Seagate will come out with a firmware update to address the idle noise.
 I woke up one morning this past week, was having morning coffee and i decided to catch up on some recorded shows on my directv hr400 dvr.<br/>then i get the message, "your hard drive has failed, please call customer service". well, i didn't want to pay 200+ for a new dvr. i did a quick search and the only solution is to replace the hard drive. with that, i quickly did a search and found that replacing the hard drive is a easy DIY task. i then ordered this hard drive. it's double the size of my previous 1tb drive that came stock with the DVR.<br/>I'm a prime member, but i needed it the NEXT DAY, and that only cost 7.00 extra. i was very happy to see that i could get this overnight for another 7.00 extra. way to go amazon.<br/>Next day, hard drive arrived, i unpacked it carefully, opened up my dvr, and popped the new drive in. replaced cover on the DVR, and plugged in the cables and booted it up. instantly the DVR saw the new hard drive, formatted it, and i was up and running in no time. I have scheduled recordings and they recorded flawlessly. I'm pretty happy with this.  Just be mindful that opening the DVR voids the warranty. my dvr was far out of warranty anyway. the original drive that came in the dvr lasted less than 3 years.<br/>FYI..technically this drive is too large for the dvr, however, by not using the directv hard drive tray it fit ok. it works great without the tray.<br/>update 6/8/18*** opening the directv dvr will subject you to a charge from Directv when you return the dvr after canceling service. however, if you keep the box long enough (usually 5 years or so) if you do cancel your service, directv may not want you to return the dvr.<br/>Almost a year in and this drive is still working perfectly! has 1tb more than the standard drive that came with the dvr.
 I purchased this hardrive with hope in my eyes a pep in my step. Upon receiving this drive, I promptly opened the box like a child experiencing their first christmas with their new, adoptive family. It was like getting a knock off barbie-- i didn't know i shouldn't have been excited until I started playing with it.<br/><br/>I plugged in the drive to my gloriously bright computer tower and opened up the BIOS. It was about as empty as my mail box on Valentines day. Confusion set in as this has never happened in the 20 years I have been building computers. Hope still in my heart however, I allowed my computer to load at lightning speeds and opened up the disk management.<br/><br/>Again, an empty void greeted me and I stared at the screen. Tears welled in my green eyes as I felt the life leaving me. I  promptly took to google and discovered there was possible software by seagate to detect and install things for the baby drive. Even after all of this, I had to accept that this baby of a drive was a stillborn and there was nothing I could do to breathe life into it.<br/><br/>What kind of company has firmware you have to download from a website to look at a harddrive? What is this, 1840s Russia?<br/><br/>Never again will I make such a fruitless purchase and I will take my money back to Western digital. At least they don't sugar coat bending me over and taking me for all im worth.
 We recently had a drive failing as it hit a critical error out of nowhere and estimated out of nowhere around 37% life left. We simply got our hands on another one of these and cloned it before all hell broke loose. New drive has been working fine and we ordered another of the exact same drive (this one to replace that one in inventory, awaiting the next big uh oh moment). These drives are typically quite reliable and last a long time. They aren't always the fastest drives as we have had our share of HDD options that can transfer quicker, but it doesn't come anywhere near slow at the same time. If you are looking for affordable and dependable while also faster than your typical "green" drives and with lots of capacity, the Barracuda line is typically a solid bet.<br/><br/>We have numerous drives ran about the various machines here, and a good number of them would be this model and fall within the 4-8TB range. Used for everything from general storage to working on video and more.
 Attend the ST8000DM004 (seagate indicates ST8000DM0004).  I ordered this drive and the box presented, ST8000DMB004.  I preferred not opening the box until I knew what I had, so off I go to find out what is this B.  I checked with seagate; they had no idea.  Amazon has not responded as of this entry, but I will save the attentive the irritation by stating you can ignore it.  The drive is ST8000DM004.  Could the B mean bare?  I have no idea, but it should then state that somewhere on this page.<br/><br/>For those wondering between ST8000DM0004 and ST8000DM0005 8TB.  The M0005 is slightly heavier and uses more power.  idle 7.2w to 4.5w.  startup power 2.0w to 1.8w.  operating mode 9w to 6.8w.  oddly,  the M0004 draws slightly more watts in standby/sleep at .6w to .8w.<br/><br/>The drive runs cool and quiet, and through a pcie sata port adapter copying at 200MB/sec.  not great when copying 6TB, but better than 60MB/sec.
 This hard drive simply failed after 6 months of use. There was no trauma or any reason to fail. I lost all my data and seagate charges 6 times the price of the hard drive ($550) to recover files. Massive setback for me. Would recommend at least buying the data recovery plan if you must have this hard drive.
 This review is for the 6tb BerraCuda pro. First and most importantly the hard drive mount is configured for two screws per side rather than the standard three screws per side. This made me modify the case mounts to be able to fit this unit. Now on to sound... A constant spinning noise dominates all. Now you might jump up and say but wait this is a 7200 rpm drive you should not expect silence and I would begrudgingly accept this argument. The counter point is that the drive never spins down even with aggressive windows power management. I would expect the drive to be loud when accessing but spin down when in idle mode but it only parks the heads. Now with all of this said please note that my noise floor is very low with my build focusing more and more on silence so this drive is by far the loudest part in the pc so I pic on it probably more than I should. The drive preforms well for a mechanical unit while providing storage for 4k footage and playing well with my caching program. TLDR fast, spacious, loud.
 Mine died after about 5 hours use. The platters were still spinning but the drive was not recognized by the OS. I immediately put in an old drive to test the MB and cable and it worked fine. Luckily this was a data drive with no data on it yet. Hats off to Amazon's return policy and customer service. Refund within 24 hrs. of dropping the drive off to be shipped back. This time I'm going with a Toshiba because I already have on and it's a proven product.<br/><br/>I hate being the QA department for every consumer electronics manufacturer out there that I decide to buy something from.
 After 36 hours of use, pending and unreadable sectors started to be detected. This drive broke a record for me as the "fastest failing drive" I've installed... and working with servers for 20 years I've dealt with innumerable drives, brands and issues. On the other hand I was lucky it failed so soon... at least it was part of a RAID-1 array and no data was lost but anyway, we had to resync the 8TB array after replacing this drive. So, save yourself some trouble and go for an HGST from the start.
 Nothing special here, I used to be able to depend on Seagate but I'm not so sure. I'm unsure because it could be Amazon with the issue and not Seagate. Amazon is huge on allowing counterfeit parts here even after the so called crack down years ago. I never buy electronics for car or home theater due to warranties not valid from non authorized sellers. While reading on about various HDs here I found more then one with the same issue. I bought the 5tb and it failed within months and I was S.O.L. there. I bought this one shortly after, (I guess I'm a gambler cuz I'm still on Amazon) almost a year later it is fine. I use it to store 4k videos and has been fine. Running tests today and speeds are about 170 for  reading and writing is 140 or so. For my use it is perfect but I was trying to combine a drive for movies music games to store and pictures so I was looking into 8tb to 12tb drives. While reviewing some I figured I'd write a review here and go outside of Amazon to a company I can trust so if data is lost I can use the warranty for a possible save and replacement of a few hundred dollars in a drive and well over $1000 in media purchases. Amazon is great but the worst at the same time. Wish they would hold sellers accountable but they must care more about increasing revenue then solid products. Frys electronics here I come
 Works great once I had it installed and formatted. It was a pain in the butt to install, but that's because of lack of planning on my part/my case, not the hard drive itself (had to flip my other 2 hard drives to get them to fit in my case). Note: if you are kind of new to this and installed the drive and it's not showing up in windows (assuming this isn't your operating system drive), you have to go to disk management where a popup will detect the new drive and you format it from there.<br/><br/>I know a good portion of people buying hard drives are gamers who need more space but just trying to help.

I notice is a lot because my place is quiet, but I can see this not being an issue if where you work has noise or if you wear headphones. Besides the noise it works great. I transferred a 115GB folder to it and it had an average write speed of about 107 mb/s. I'll give this drive a couple days to redeem itself and I'll edit this if it gets better but I don't see a bright future for this drive in my computer.<br/><br/>For the video you'll have to turn your volume up, my phone doesn't capture the sound very well.
 Just got the drive spent much longer then I should have cloning. Drive was only getting about 60MBs of speed on writes instead of the around 170-200 it should have even that I can live with for what the drive will be used for but it’s also having issues with super high response times hitting upwards or 5000-10000ms. Drive is unusable even as a secondary drive. I’m sure it’s not the case with all of the drives and I’m sure plenty work and get advertised speeds but based on the reviews I’d say 20-30% are basically doa or have issues within the first 6 months and that is unacceptable returning mine and going with a drive I can hopefully trust like a WD blue. Save your time avoid the seagate baracuda(not sure about the pro this is only based on the standard baracuda 4tb drive but I’m not risking ordering another seagate drive to find out if those too have issues or not)
 06/27/2018 ... I installed this in my neighbor's laptop computer HP Pavilion 17-E098NR Notebook PC on 05/03/2018 and two months later there have been no problems except one of the updates to windows 10 prevented the laptop from booting but fortunately I made backups at each step with Acronis True Image 2018 using the bootable DVD.  I delivered the laptop to my neighbors and it has been working fine.<br/><br/>Traditional "Spinner" hard drive or SSD?  I did a lot of research and decided the risk of a sudden failure or silently corrupted files was not worth the price no matter how fast SSD's run.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>Speed - Comparing the performance of the old hard drive I would say this is 30% or mor faster and lots more space - 250GB vs 1TB.  System boots much quicker and programs start faster.  The large cache memory seems to make the drive faster than it really is... more about this in "CONS" below.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>Speed - Fast as mentioned above BUT... there is some magicians slight of hand going on involving the cache memory.  Ordinary read / write activites happen fast but large file copes start fast and slow way down. I partitioned the drive so that there was a D: drive - to store a backup inamge of the C: drive (I also put a copy on my home computer in case the entire drive failed).  I was shocked at how slow a file transfer was from C: to D: (two different partitions on the same drive) it should normally be 1/2 the speed as it is a read and write operation.  I also did a speed test of copying the same large files over my home network through and Ethernet cable and a usb drive.  In all cases the drive has a speed burst then the cache memory runs out and the copy fell to speeds like 7 to 10 MB/s! - can't remember exact speeds.  Most people don't do these types of file operations so it should not matter.<br/><br/>I also bought the same 1TB drive (Except the 5.25" desktop version)  at the same time from amazon for my Desktop PC and it did not have such dramatic slowdowns.
 The last two hard drives I purchased from Amazon were both Seagate drives.  And they were both corrupted within a year.  Some people might blame Microsoft and Windows 10, but I blame SEAGATE because none of my Western Digital hard drives ever had this issue.  I will never again purchase a Seagate hard drive.
 Can I return this drive?<br/>The drive is NOISY and SLOW.<br/>As I began loading all my data from my external USB drive onto this bigger internal drive, the actual transfer rate started at about 160MB/s.  In just 5 minutes, the transfer rate began cycling between 80MB/s and ZERO.  I checked the performance of the hard drives and found that this 8TB drive was operating at 100%, while my old external USB drive was running between 40% and ZERO.  Previously, before the transfer rate slowed to a crawl, it was at 100% while the external drive was operating at 90%.<br/>How is this possible?  Both drives have identical specs other than size and interface -- the new drive is 8TB and is internal via SATA III, the old drive is 4TB and is external via USB 3.0.  ALTHOUGH, this new 8TB drive was described as 7200rpm, but Speccy shows it is running at 5425rpm!<br/>I can only surmise that it is a temperature issue; but Speccy reports the temperature on this new 8TB drive is a constant 41°C while my old external USB drive is 48°C.  So I guess it isn't a temperature issue.  In any case. my confidence in this drive is low.  I can see that I am going to have to setup reminders so that I backup my data OFTEN!<br/>Can I return this drive for these issues?
 We almost purchased the 1TB version of this.  My son wanted the 1TB version and I asked how much the 2TB version was.  It was hardly any more for twice the storage.<br/><br/>I work in IT and I rarely see hard drives fail.  I think that is because hard drives are pretty reliable and they are obsolete before they have a chance to fail.  Moving your PC while it is on can be tough on a drive and can cause a failure though.  I have seen certain makes and models that are prone to failure but it has been years since I have seen that.  (One specific model of Quantum drives about 15 years ago would fail at a pretty high rate)<br/><br/>I use solid state drives as my boot drive but these are great for storage of large files.
 This thing failed in the first 5 minutes of use.  It makes a rattle chirp rattle chirp noise.  Won't stop making the noise and be recognized.  I just put the orignial box in the dumpster and don't want to dig for it now to try for a refund.  This is the 4TB 3.5in drive.  I also did a format on it when it arrived to make sure it wasn't DOA.  Take it out of the box a few months later and it quickly self destructs.
 It is working perfectly in a SATA 2 business / office PC from 2010. A clean install of Windows 10 1803 took 49 minutes (with delays from wireless network trouble and no way to get my user account rolling without creating a PIN). At the device installation screen it said the drive had 1,863 gigabytes of space. It works silently. Windows 10 scanned for errors and found none. 143 gigabytes of archived files from another SATA drive were copied over at 30 to 85 megabytes per second. The SMART data says it's a 7200 RPM drive with two power cycles and two hours of use, so it is not a used drive returned by another customer. It was packed OEM style in a small cardboard box with two plastic spacers to keep it suspended in the center.<br/><br/>I will use this drive for backing up all my data and having easy access to old files. It will be great to hold on to large HD video files from an action camera without having to choose which ones to delete to make room. I'm sure a 32 gigabyte USB 3.0 flash drive dedicated to ReadyBoost will help the system have faster access time for frequently used files. Windows 10 1803 boot time was 85 seconds. After changing msconfig to use 4 processors, it went down to 62 seconds. Drive activity settled back to 0% at 114 seconds.<br/><br/>The review and rating will be updated if there are any problems.
 I was kind of skeptical purchasing this drive because of so many bad reviews. I purchased 12TB version of the drive and it came as advertised. Tested the drive OK. Speeds seemed to be reasonable about 200-250 MB/s. For example 1GB file copied in just 3 seconds! This drive is also very quiet! Pretty much makes zero noise when in operation. I ran a CrystalDiskMark (attached screenshot)<br/><br/>I was able to register it on Seagate's website successfully and it does come with 5 year warranty and 2 year data recovery option.<br/><br/>One negative cosmetic thing I found about the drive is that screw holes on the drive are not in the same position as any other drive I have ever used! For some reason Seagate decided to change it. There is no middle screw hole so the drive would not fit into my PC drive plastic enclosure! My enclosure had 3 plastic pins for 3 holes on each side however this drive only had 2 holes on each side) I had to break middle pin on my enclosure to be able to insert the drive in it. No big deal to be honest, I did not take a star off the drive for such a small thing. Maybe its a new design going forward?
 Me and my friend had to go through hell and back to get this drive to work properly. Turns out that this particular drive was refurbished and had multiple volumes and partitions installed on it before hand. And this thing was advertised as brand new, It was only allowing the maximum of 2tb out of the 4tb to be used. I am not satisfied with this product and will not be doing business with them again. The drives works now but this is just shady business plain and simple<br/><br/>Update: drive is already failing, causing spikes in any program i use.
 Went through 3 separate drives and all had the same issue of constantly clicking when on idle. The clicking sound is so loud that i can't even sleep through it. I even reformatted and only transferred 1 file to the drive. A couple minutes later it will make the clicking sound.<br/><br/>Looking at SMART data, each drive had "g-sense" counter going up. I do have the normal barracuda drives that have no issues. The pro drives have given me nothing but headache. The 3 drives tested were manufactured in Thailand between March and April 2017. What could have caused mechanical issues is rough shipment.<br/><br/>The only reason i bought the pros is due to Amazon Deal of the Day pricing and the 5 year warranty. No way i would stick with the drive if it wasnt running as normal.<br/><br/>Pros: Drives were faster than the normal barracuda.
 DOA (Dead on arrival). Absolutely furious upon receiving this as I was in the middle of my first PC build. I was stuck with a 128gb m.2 as my ENTIRE storage for my $1400 build while I waited to get my money back for this. I know for a fact this isn’t a normal occurrence but I was pretty mad and still kind of am. I returned this absolute fart and bought a 1tb on Newegg instead. Note to self: Don’t buy refurbished hard drives in the future
 I originally bought this drive to be my basic data drive and just hold things that didn't require extremely fast drive performance. At first, I didn't put many of my game library on there, but as my SSDs began to fill up, more and more of my games wound up installed there. Eventually, I even began putting more modern, high-performance games on this hard drive and I was blown away by how fast it was compared to my SSDs. Yes, my SSDs are still faster (Samsung 840 pro and 850 evo) but I was able to load into games in exactly the same amount of time as my friends who had those games installed on SSDs similar to my own.<br/><br/>Read/write performance has so far been extremely stable and I can consistently get speeds up to around 200+ MB/s when I'm transferring a large number of files from one drive to another. I've had this drive for about a year and a half so far, so maybe some of the more recent bad reviews reflect some quality control issues with the drive.
 I purchased a 2 TB BarraCuda ST2000DM006 May of 2017.<br/>I installed and partitioned it in two equal partitions.<br/>In Feb. of 2018 I couldn't access one of the partitions “The disk structure is corrupted and unreadable”<br/>After taking the PC to a repair shop and jumping through Seagates hoops the HDD was replaced.<br/>The Seagate web site is difficult to use and even more difficult to contact via phone.<br/>I couldn't recommend Seagate, mostly due to their difficult to use support.
 I purchased this 8TB Seagate BarraCuda drive in May 2018 and installed it at the beginning of June 2018, registered it with Seagate's website, everything was running great for nearly 5 months, until it didn't. "No biggie," I thought, "I've been using these drives for years- it's about time I had to call tech support." I'd installed it in my fileserver, so the contents of the drive were all backed up and I wasn't worried. I reached out to Seagate, ordered another drive (yay, expansion) and waited to hear back... only to receive an email (after a few days) that my drive wasn't eligible for warranty because I bought it from the wrong seller online. Ummm, what? Does anyone actually shop at a brick &amp; mortar for such things anymore? The nearest to me is a two-hour drive, so I sure don't. So here I am, past the return date on Amazon and without warranty support from the manufacturer (which is supposed to be 1 or 2 years, depending on which document you read on Seagate's site), with a $200 paperweight on my desk, writing to let you know that Seagate has let me down. I've got over 60TB of storage on my fileserver and another 40-ishTB on my Drobo (I'm a  photographer) and they're all Seagate drives, but I guess they've lost me as a customer. Guess it's time to look into other options.<br/>TL;DR - great drives until they're not, and cross your fingers that you don't have to rely on their warranty.
 Horrible drive.  I have bought four Seagate drives over the last two years, al 2 TB drives and all have failed within months. Either UPS is being above average in their aggressive and rough handling of these drives, or they are simply poorly made.  And Seagate support is utterly abysmal.  Better off buying Western Digital.
 Bought this 4TB internal HDD from Amazon on September 9 and installed it the first week of October.  It went defective and crashed the first week of December. Expected to get at least a couple or few years out of it, not just 2 months. Thankfully it was part of a RAID5 setup on my NAS device, so not data was lost, and it's under warranty, of course, but what a pain and inconvenience.
 Drive came inside a plain open cardboard box with plastic spacers to hold it in place<br/>Except for the drive packaged inside an anti static bag, nothing else is included<br/>Screw layout is a little different with 3 on the left and 1 on the center right but otherwise it works<br/>Normally pretty quiet, but i still hear the occasional audible click and spin during use<br/>Speeds are pretty fast as only WD Black beats the Barracuda in this price category<br/>Limited two year warranty so only time will tell how long these drives will last.<br/>Note: No instructions so format the drive and set the page file size before use!
 Ordered this hard drive to replace a failing Western Digital. Ordered it with Prime and was supposed to be 2 day free shipping. Extra happy when it showed up a day early. Installed in my computer and installed my OS. Good so far. I took 1 star off because I did not like the way it was packaged. It came in a bubble folder like you would mail a CD in. No box. Absolutely no protection except air blisters. I can only imagine how bad this thing was banged around. Came in the normal anti-static bag.
 Works well and is fast. In use just one week. No instructions included for installation, but Seagate web page had all necessary steps for installing, initializing, partitioning and formatting for Windows 10. No installation or setup problems. My desktop PC has four internal hard drives. Every three to five years one of them fails and I have to replace it. This drive replaced a 2 TB Western Digital Green hard drive that lasted five years. Before that one, the last to fail was a Seagate. Every hard drive will fail, just a matter of time. Backup is essential. I do not use backup software. Had too many backup images fail when I needed them. For the last six years, I use Microsoft's free SyncToy program to update my backup drives.
 I had to send this back while in the middle of building a PC. After installing Win 10 it froze up and kinda said, "I don't wanna". Luckily I had 2 other drives that I could put in and work back and forth to get them functioning with the Ryzen CPU. The drive that I ended up putting in had Win 7 on it and Ryzen doesn't play well with 7.
 Best replacement over the other brand. Very quiet, and fast..... I even got another one and Cloned the previous one as a backup. One in the PC, and the other sits in my docking station.<br/>Also, it is very east to down the Seagate application the website directly to clone yours as a backup HDD files and operation system in the event one fail. it is simple, just pop in the back up one and you will never miss a beat.<br/>However, you must make sure that you have a Seagate HDD installed with the operations system you intent to clone and follow the command.<br/>After you open the Seagate Application: (Source is always the current operating system, and Target is where you want to install/backup the one in your PC.
 Perfect.<br/>I got the 8TB hard drive used primarily on my rig for storage of videos, games, and edited photos and videos. I’ve already filled up about half the drive and is super efficient for a great price!<br/><br/>Update: I ordered in February 2018.<br/>I moved all of my stuff over from the other drive. It is now MAY, and my system checker says the hard drive has too many bad sectors and is 2% away from failure. This is such a damn shame and the warranty ran out less than a month ago. this is the first seagate that has ever failed me! :(
 For those who don't want a wall of text the first picture is the packaging the first drive arrived in, broken. The second picture is what the replacement arrived in, working just fine.<br/>-----<br/>I received the first drive in a plastic bag, inside an amazon bubble wrap envelope. When I plugged the drive into my computer and started up it made a loud clicking noise and my computer would not start. 'attempting repairs' followed by a restart ect... Left it for 6 hours and still in a restart loop. Tried force restarting and turning it back on several times to no avail.  Unplugged the drive and my computer started normally.<br/><br/>After contacting amazon support I got a replacement drive within a few days which arrived in a shock absorbent cardboard case, and the same kind of amazon packaging as the first around that. This one worked like a charm.<br/><br/>I give this 3 stars because the replacement process was so straight-forward and painless with amazon, but it amazes me that such sensitive hardware would be shipped so carelessly. An unprotected drive is rated to break from a fall of just 3 feet (1 meter). That's just above someone's waist, so unless they are toting these around on all fours, one drop during the shipping process may have been what broke the first drive. An extra few bucks to protect 100$ worth of hardware? nah plastic bags protect hard drives. (sarcasm)
 The hard drive completely failed within 37 days of ordinary use in a well built computer. Although this is not unheard of it represents a growing quality control issue at Seagate.
 Needed more storage for my media after my 3TB drive was full so I bought this which is the newer version of the one I already had. The first one was bought in about November of 2014 and has been in constant use since and hadn’t had any issues. It’s totally full and I have it in a small fitted enclosure I bought off amazon that cane with the usb 3.0 plug. I’ve plugged it into multiple computers, media players and my Sony Bravia that has a media player built in. It’s worked with all devices I’ve plugged it into with no issues. Transfer speeds can be a bit slow on things over 1GB but it’s tolerable since I only need to do it once per file usually. That’s mostly due in part probably up me transferring a lot of content at once. I’d recommend.
 Bought a pair of these for my NAS server. It even suffered an accidental three feet drop to the wooden floor at home one in its original packing and one just in the box devoid of its packaging. I purchased some #6-32 1/2 inch screws (Everbilt Brand) and installed the disk in my NAS. Lo behold they worked just fine and now I have 1.73 TB 10 Raid NAS storage !!!! Kudos that it survived a fall and still worked like a champ. I dont seem to be bothered with the AMP feature, I guess my NAS software could handle it. FYI, the NAS in question is Synology DS416play.<br/>Plan to add two more with 8TB capacity to fill the remaining 2 slots in the NAS.
 From the moment I plugged it in, this drive has been a dream, 10TB of storage is a lot and I don't plan on needing any more storage for the many years to come. It's also a really fast drive too considering the fact that this is a HDD and not an SSD. I've had no noise issues which I was slightly worried about since the mounting holes on this drive only let me screw in 2 screws into this drive using the mounting system in my rosewill blackhawk ultra case, but it is running very well. It's a pretty penny to pay, but from my experiences with this drive, it's entirely worth it if you have any need for this much storage. Heat has also simply not been an issue with me on this drive too in case anyone was wondering. I will update if anything changes.<br/><br/>Update 3/28/2017: After using it for almost a solid month for gaming, I can confirm that the drive is still running amazingly :)
 This one worked straight out of the box/bag. This is a replacement for the first 3TB I received that was DOA. I've used western digital. Yes, I know I didn't capitalize both words, but there's a reason for that. I don't like that brand. WD have failed on me several times. I lost a lot of meaningful content that was saved to a WD hard drive, which was less than two years old. That hurt. I like Seagate because I've never lost anything on them and some of those are 6 or 7 years old. There are now my goto brand. I don't buy anything else. They have earned my loyalty.
 My drive just died after less than 2 years. I build all my computers; and if the "whole" system is properly taken care of, drives can last upwards of 7 years. Now, I have to recover my data by finding a circuit board for power. The single most important quality in an HDD is if it will cause you to lose data in any way. I'd take a slow drive that would last forever, over a drive that could transfer at light speed but might die at any moment. Now, I must do what all PC owners dread - data recovery.
 I ordered one of these Feb 26 of 2018, put it into a Drobo about a week later, and it's now reading as FAILED in my Drobo. I put a new drive into the Drobo and all seems fine now, but a hard drive that has only been used for "Long Term" storage and has barely been used at this point, shouldn't be failing in 4-4.5 months. I checked on the Seagate site for a warranty, but Seagate is telling me that "The product you identified was sold as a system component."... Seagate tells me to contact the retailer that I purchased it from, but it was purchased on Amazon. This array of drives store my life's work, and this sort of thing doesn't exactly give me confidence with my other Seagate drives.
 It is whisper quiet, fast transfers of data and only time will tell if it lasts. $90 bucks to safeguard my data is worth it; especially when one of my older hard drives is starting to do the clickity-click thing and it sleeps more than it is awake.<br/><br/>I wish I could have afforded the 6TB drive but this 4TB drive seems to be the best range price wise vs storage capacity right now.<br/><br/>Seagate has been around for a long time, they must know what they are doing. This drive is standard size but it is still a bit more sleek than my older drives.<br/><br/>To heft it, it seems like a solid piece of newer technology...<br/><br/>I had to go into my Windows 10 disk manager and allocate the default space it found, then it quick formatted in seconds to NTFS and it has had a constantly level data flow of over a TB to it with no problems at all. I'm sure the 256 mb cache helps a lot in that respect.<br/><br/>I am very happy with this purchase!
 This hard drive is currently rated number 1 in value, 9th in effective speed, and is 2nd in user ratings at userbenchmark.com. On top of that, it is the 2nd newest drive to be released (10 months old currently), so with the awesome 3 year warranty Seagate offers, that means you can even buy a used drive, and it's still under warranty for more than 2 years. Oh and did I mention how quiet it is, I've never had a hard drive before that I could barely hear even when defragging (or otherwise @100% speed), the fans on my case are louder, and I have some nice, quiet fans!<br/><br/>The one weakness this drive has is the 4k speeds (lots of small files at the same time), so do not use this as a system drive, but honestly everyone should be using Solid State for their OS these days anyway. If you simply have no choice but to put your OS on a Hard Drive, get a Barracuda Pro 10TB or WD Black 6 TB.<br/><br/>TL;DR = Best hard drive you can get under $35 per TB, just don't use for storing/accessing small files frequently and you'll love it.
 It has great speeds and an outstanding 5-year warranty.<br/><br/>I am not convinced that the "Pro" version of this hard drive is actually much better other than the 2-year warranty extension. There are cheaper ways to get an extended warranty on hardware.<br/><br/>I using the standard version of this hard drive in conjunction with a <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/StarTech-com-USB-3-1-10Gbps-Standalone-Duplicator-Dock-for-2-5-34-3-5-34-SATA-SSD-HDD-SDOCK2U313R/dp/B019Y4JE22/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">StarTech.com USB 3.1 (10Gbps) Standalone Duplicator Dock for 2.5" &amp; 3.5" SATA SSD / HDD (SDOCK2U313R)</a> as my macOS Time Machine backup drive for my MacBook Pro. It has done great so far.
 Drive died within a few hours of use. Had to pay to get it installed in my imac. The drive died after using the computer for only a few hours. Now i have to pay again to get it removed and replaced!
 While working on a project my drive suddenly stopped work, I never heard any sounds coming from the drive or had any warning, after a reboot the drive showed up but most of my files were missing, after calling tech support they had me download the recovery software, that said that there wasn't anything on my drive. now when I look at the drive in Disk Manager, it says my 8TB drive is a 16TB drive, needless to say, all my data is lost, the project I was almost done working on is gone and my Clients are pissed, I am out a lot of money because this drive failed, and Seagate wants me to spend $700 to get it back. A little more compassion from Seagate would have been nice considering that people rely on their drives for work, I am a freelancer and this failure has cost me a gig and future client gigs.<br/><br/>I understand that drives don't often fail, this is the first drive I have ever had fail and I have drives that are over 5 years old still kicking, but having a drive fail in 7 months, and fail so completely that i can't recover anything, and my only option is a $700 recovery fee is kinda crummy, I would think they would have something in place for data recover for drives that fail so quickly.<br/><br/>don't waste your money on their recovery  protection, just buy a second drive and raid it together. they don't offer any realistic options on recovery.
 On a Sata III port, I'm getting read and write speeds (4GB size video files) averaging 180MB/sec.  I'm really just using this as an archive drive, but the speed exceeded my expectations.  It is quiet - I can't hear it in my case.  It does not seem to get very hot according to my HDD thermal monitors, the accuracy of which I have no idea.<br/><br/>Unlike many HDD reviewers, I'm not faithful to one drive manufacturer over another, other than I like to stick with long time major name brands and decent warranties.  I bought the Seagate over WD and others based on  price, capacity, and HDD speed.  I wanted a 7200 rpm HDD.  Most other HDD's in the 3TB plus capactity only seem to run at 5200-5400rpms these days.
 My computer had a problem in late 2016 so I had everything taken off my drive and saved externally. My friend said after wipeing it that more than likely the drive will crash again and will be unrecoverable. He was right so I ordered this one and had it installed.<br/>Product Review<br/>*PROS*<br/>I’ve had this one for over two years and is working great<br/>I use my computer daily so it’s great<br/>Was easy to install<br/>*CONS*<br/>None so far (been over two years)<br/><br/>I see a lot of negative reviews on this product lately they must have went to a third party seller and selling nock offs because mine is perfect but again I purchased it along time ago...
 I really wanted this drive because of the cache and overall speed as well as the 5yr warranty but my 6TB drive arrived defective according to the computer technician who came out to install it.  Returned it for a replacement and it was defective also.  The tech says he has used a lot of 2TB with no problems so perhaps the problem is only with the 6TB?  I'll have to find an alternative.
 Love it.  My only problem is I made a mistake ordering the 3tb.  Its too small to hold all my photos.  I needed the 4 tb drive.  How I have to save and then get the 4 tb drive.  Very quiet.  Get warm fast.  My laptop could not work with it on a usb hub.  The hub is 3.0.  Took me over 30 min's to realized this.  I then hooked it up to my 3.1 C usb and then it showed up and was online.  Wow.  Not sure why it would not work with my HUB?<br/>The speed I am getting is approximately 133mb per sec.  Not bad at all.<br/>Make sure you get the right size drive.
 Got this hard drive 1TB. It worked fine the first week or two, now it pauses every time I have to access the drive. Also it is making a humming noise that is getting louder. Ran all tests and they say it's fine Seagate say's no upgrade this disk is fine. Will never purchase a Seagate drive again as this is number two that I have had trouble with. If you are thinking of purchasing a Barracuda Junk is the answer!
 My 1.5 TB drive started coming up with errors. So, I looked for something high performance that would allow me to store more working files before archiving them to the redundant server I have  access to with unlimited storage. I do primarily photo and some video editing on this station, so large capacity is critical, as is faster response times of retrieving and saving images expedites the process immensely. After a couple of weeks, my preliminary evaluation is excellent.
 I saw several issues other had encountered with refurbished or not-for-resale pulled drives being shipped as new. Well, these worked fine. I checked the serial numbers on the Seagate site before I installed them, and both came up as under warranty. I'm not sure what happened with the problems others had, but none of those problems here. Both drives show up as 4TB as well in BIOS.
 I installed it fine and everything. Went to go set it up and allocate for the space but it only showed up as 1.81tb of space. Even after initializing it as GPT. I checked several tutorial videos and such and did all the same steps accordingly but it does not even show up as being a 10tb drive. I hate to think that I may have gotten a mislabeled drive. If anyone has any clue as to how to solve this problem it may change my rating on this drive. It seems near impossible for me to get in touch with Seagate for tech support.
 This 3 TB hard drive from Seagate spins at a very nice 7200 rpm giving typically 180 mb+ read performance.  If you want reasonable performance from your HDD skip the 5400 rpm and 5900 rpm models that are commonly sold to consumers.<br/><br/>What this means is that you can partition roughly the first 900 MB for a fast 'game/app' drive.  Then use the rest of the volume for media storage that is slower - ie movies, pdfs, documents, etc.<br/><br/>Very pleased with the value on this drive as I bought it at $75 so that's only $25 per terabyte of premium<br/> performance.  Keep an eye out on these if they ever go on sale, well worth it!
 After installing, the first 4TB drive worked for less than an hour at 4TB. Suddenly on its' own it became a 1.99TB. ??? Something must have come apart inside the drive. Ordered a replacement which Amazon sent immediately. My machine could not "see" the replacement drive so I sent both units back and bought an 8TB external drive. The 8TB unit works ok but has only a 7.27 TB capacity. Yup, 7.27 TB capacity in a Seagate "8TB" drive!
 If you are looking for a Hard Drive for large amounts of video storage or maybe something to put your large games library on. Then look no further because this hard drive is perfect for anyone needing a hard drive that is extremely durable, fast, and dense. The body of the hard drive is made up of cast metal with a pressed steel plate as the cover that gives the hard drive it's impressive durability, The hard drive is ultra low noise and barely makes a sound even under high load. The sata power and data connectors are solid and don't feel like there going to break off anytime soon unlike some other hard drives, And as usual Amazon Prime delivered the package fast and safely with no problems and a healthy amount of focus on product safety during transit. In conclusion I would say that I spent my money wisely and when this drive fills up then i'm definitely coming back to buy another.
 don't be surprised if this shows up in my computer at about 1.8 TB.  I'll explain for the uninformed.  manufacturers state capacity as 10 to the x power. so 2TB to the manufacturer is 2 x 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000  - 2,000,000,000,000 bytes.  makes sense. right. humans smart.  (pity the poor Romans who had no symbol to represent 0).  computers stupid. all  they know, at least until AI comes in are  0's and 1's.  Thus computers think that 2TB is 2 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024  or 2  x 2^40 - 2,200,000,000,000 bytes.  so computers looks at the hard drive as containing only about 90% of 2 TB or 1.8 TB.  one other thing.  these come unformatted which  means they might not show up in my computer until formatted.  you do know how to format a drive?
 I hate when people leave reviews for products because they received something that didn’t work. Things happen, especially with hard drives, BUT... I received and attempted to use 2 of these drives. Neither of which worked. The first couldn’t be recognized, and the 2nd would accept any amount of data. I’d start a transfer of my old data and the transfer would stall out. Scan Disk found errors which it said it repaired,  but then they would come back. Finally went out and bought a 10TB drive from WD and it worked flawlessly doing the same thing I’d attempted with this drive.<br/><br/>So I don’t know if it’s a inherent problem with this model or if the seller is just selling a bad batch. But I had horrible luck.
 I installed this drive to use it as my back up data storage.<br/>BIG MISTAKE!!! DONT BE FOOLED BY PRICE!!!<br/>Makes my PC freeze and also makes it randomly restart.<br/>PC runs smooth as butter after removing this HDD.<br/>I will stick to WD HDD from now on.
 Put two of these into a Drobo Raid (that had 2TB Barracuda drives) as part of my stepwise expansion.  The original 2TB drives are still spinning (after 2 years) but the 3TB drives didn't even last a full year.  I saw some technical analysis that suggested 3TB drives in general had a higher failure rate than others, so going to start swapping in 4TB drives instead.
 I bought this drive during the Black Friday sale back in November. After the drive arrived I have some problems with getting it to work in a couple of my computers. This turned out to be a formatting problem with my computers, but the Seagate tech support sent me another drive to help troubleshoot the problem - excellent help from them and very quick on the shipping. With the computer's formatting issue solved the drive has been running without a hiccup since December 2018. I am now using this drive in a DROBO 5 bay DAS for streaming video and storing photography.
 I looked online and even reviewed Seagate's responses to other people to no avail, so I decide to look for a workaround myself.<br/><br/>To Solve in Windows 10:<br/><br/>Go to Device Manager.<br/>Then Disk Drives.<br/>Right click on your noisy drive.<br/>Under Removal Tab, is Removal Policy.<br/>If Better Performance is selected, switching to Quick Removal shuts the damn thing up.<br/><br/>Since this is my backup drive, I do not care about the default option.<br/><br/>It would be nice if the noise was fixed with Better Performance selected, but my guess is that having a 6TB and an extra disk platter inside the same 3.5in casing makes a recipe for design issues.  Add to that, Seagates's proprietary Multi Tier Caching Technology and you get a slight heartbeat from the drive that kicks a little every 1.5-2 seconds which you can clearly hear and feel when you touch it.  Also, I have not updated the firmware and don't know if that even solves the issue, but I am happy with my workaround.
 IT vet here.<br/><br/>Plug and play. No fuss no muss. Stable, steady data flow. I bought it for storage, but tested it with Steam for installing and running games, as well as editing video files. It passed with flying colors on both. At a later date, I will be buying another to store my horde of games to have them installed and ready to go at a whim. Highly recommend for storage, gaming and editing. The 256MB cache seems to have made the difference with speed. Very nice balance of speed/cost-effectiveness.
 It's not a bad drive if you are just storing some documents and images. I've used Seagate for years and haven't had bad experiences with their products. However, I bought this drive because of the price per TB for Burstcoin mining. The only complaint I have about this drive is that its write speed is VERY slow. It took a full 2 days to plot the entire 4TB when I could have plotted a full 8TB on a WD external drive in about a day and a half. Now that it is plotted the read speed is pretty good and I expect to get a ROI in less than a month.
 Needed to replace a fauly 1TB hard drive from an HP AiO.<br/>This one looked good enough and i'm satisfied with it. Three months in and have not had any issues so far.<br/>I had some unrecognized/missing HD errors initially but I found that the HD dock was not properly screwed in. I guess the vibrations from the HDD made it disconnect from the SATA port. Once I adjusted the screw, have not had any issues.<br/><br/>12/15/2017 - Update<br/>No issues whatsoever.
 Was Dead On Arrival. Installed the drive and attempted to copy roughly 300GB of data to it. Halfway through the copy, it would freeze, and the drive would spin up over and over until I shut down the computer. Ran a CrystalDiskInfo analysis and it showed 91 Reallocated Sectors in less than one day of use. Ran a SeaTools short drive test, and the drive failed at 10%. Returned the HDD for a refund.
 I bought two of these and both failed within a few days of being installed in a new Drobo 5N2. I got a replacement for one and the replacement is currently working, but I don't know if I trust it anymore. The other failed drive is being returned for a refund and I'm buying something else to replace it.
 I will say that this drive is not what I was expecting at all.<br/>I bought this drive as a replacement for the sublime Samsung Spinpoint 1TB as I had run out of room on that drive.<br/>When I would open up a media folder with video files these would load up pretty quickly without delay and minimal lag as the drive spun up to speed and read the sector. There was a slight whine to the start up which is expected with these but it was quite minimal and unobtrusive or annoying.<br/><br/>Not so with the Barracuda, these drives make a quite audible almost grind like sound upon spinning up, something I wouldn't mind if it wasn't for that awful lag. Opening up a folder and waiting for the spin up and the drive to read the files takes forever, like a whole minute or two for it to read the files in the drive and open and start up the video. This drive to me sucks in terms of a media drive. I wish I was able to get something in the same size with a hybrid setup for media files but I don't recommend this drive for media files at all.
 Ordered five of these from Amazon, installed easily into a Drobo 5DR. Horribly slow from the start, learning afterward that they were 5400rpm instead of the 7200rpm drives one would normally place in a RAID system. Call this first one "my bad."<br/><br/>First drive failed after six months.<br/><br/>I went to the Seagate site, entered the serial number for warranty, and got a message on screen reading "Warranty Information Not Available. Contact customer support."<br/><br/>I contacted Seagate customer support through the site, got a case #, was informed there would be a callback in 17 minutes.<br/><br/>Never happened.<br/><br/>After the Drobo rebuilt the data, I put in a replacement drive (7200rpm). When I came downstairs this morning, I saw that two more drives from the original order had failed.<br/><br/>Worst hard drive experience I've ever had, and uncertain as to what I should do next.
 If you are looking for a fast drive, this is NOT it!<br/>The ST4000DM004 (4tb version) advertised on this page is NOT a 7200 rpm drive, but a 5400 rpm drive according to both CrystalDiskInfo and the Seagate website. The only reason I did not return it after finding out this fact, was that I had an older 2tb drive that was in its death throws, and it had to be backed up immediately. I could have saved a bunch of coin by purchasing a 6tb external for the same money for the same speed/performance.
 Highly advise against these SMR drives. They are super slow for writing any data. They will write a little bit of data to a small cache quickly but once the cache is full, writes slow down drastically. They also won't work well in any arrays like a Drobo. Ordered 3 - all three were all super bad - sent back to Amazon and bought more expensive drives in replacement!
 Nice disk drive.  Nice price for a Tera Byte.  Seagate makes good stuff.  Disk space amazes me... when I retired from my<br/>SysAdm job some 20 years ago, a single gig was a lot of disk space.  And we had a Storage Tech Tape Silo that was SLOW<br/>and needed a lot of space in a conditioned computer room and cost a million dollars --- just to store a Tera Byte of data.<br/>Users of todays equipment just don't know how good they have it!
 I have used Seagate HD for years and was  very disappointed by the quality. The first would not format  in the Seagate NTFS for Mac software downloaded from their website (version 15.02). So I returned is to Amazon for a replacement. The second one performed the same, so  it, too, has been returned. Very disappointed!
 Works great. Tested as brand new. No errors or bad sectors. It's quiet and a perfect addition to my oldest son's black and gold box PC. The original 750GB WD Blue and 250 Samsung SSD were nearing capacity. This HDD is exactly what he needed to unload the SSD and have more data space period. The SSD now runs faster with only about 110 GB on it and the 750 HDD works better with it down to about 500 GB. I will but this again. I recommend this product. 5 Stars.
 I decided to upgrade our aging storage drive of 1TB to a 4TB drive.  I figured since I filled up the 1TB over a year or two, that doubling it wouldn't last long enough.  I could also get a few more 4TB drives down the road and make a decent raid array with more than enough storage.<br/><br/>Anyway, the drive went in great, no problems at all, I copied 935GB from the old drive to this one at an average of 115MB/sec.<br/><br/>I cannot be initialized in Windows 7 as an MBR, use the GPT or you will not get the full size.  It is also recommended online to use the default allocation size.  After initializing the drive and formatting it, I was done.
 I got one with a read error on the Long Generic test Seagate offers with there SeaTools HDD testing software. Which sucks but I got a replacement and got one without any read errors. So as I said in title as with every drive there are lemons.<br/><br/>To avoid this all u need to do is STRESS TEST the HDD properly before the 30 day return period closes with Amazon. By that point if it still works then you should be set for at least 6-12months. And then if u hit that mark then another 1-2 yrs is likely.<br/><br/>So my point is test your HDD with SeaTools along with HD Tune Pro to test for read/write errors, SMART tests, and how fast each sector of the drive is. This will be able to help u figure out if your drive will die sooner then you'd like. Do your research is all I ask. And u won't be in a situation where your drive failed because u didn't predict its death better.<br/><br/>Good luck...
 DOA.Just sent it back for full refund.<br/>Had purchased another one a couple a days ago and it mysteriously dropped off my RAID6. Giving it another chance but based on other reviews here it doesn't sound to promising. None the less this last drive will be the last of the Seagate's I buy for a couple of years until they purge the dummies that thought that what ever they are doing was a good idea.<br/>Seems to be a race to the bottom in the HDD industry these days.
 Plugged this hard drive into my PC and it didn't even power up. Couldn't find it in the Device Manager or the BIOS so I looked online for answers on how to get it working. I had a working CD ROM Drive at the time with power so I tried using the SATA Cable and Data Connector as instructed, no power, not recognized. Went to plug my CD ROM back into the same cables as when they were working and couldn't get that to power/read anymore. Thought it might have been the Power Supply that had a bad connection so I borrowed an extra Hard Drive from a friend and it worked just fine. Tried this Hard Drive on his backup computer and it didn't read. Not only did I get a defective Hard Drive, now I have to figure out why my CD ROM isn't working (most likely a Driver issue). Not that I necessarily need my CD ROM Drive, but the fact that it was working until I tried to put this into my system, is quite annoying.
 The first one of these I received made a clicking/thunking noise about every second or so even though I wasn't accessing it. I was using it as a secondary drive on a PC. The noise sounded like the actuator arm was having difficulties finding it's place. From years of working with drives, and having heard this noise before, this did not bode well for the longevity/dependability of the drive although I could not get it to fail the basic tests in Seagate's Seatools. I've learned to not wait too long to see what happens next and I always back up. Based on other reviews, I wasn't going to take any chances. I needed this drive to work dependably. As a result, I sent it back to Amazon as defective within the 30 days of purchase -- no problems with the return -- went smoothly -- thanks Amazon! The new replacement drive does not exhibit this noise I described at all and is perfectly quiet when not in use -- spare an occasional click. My suggestion to anyone who is buying this drive is to not use the "quick format" so you are sure the drive is working properly. Yes, it will take quite a few hours to do a full format, but it's worth the piece of mind. I've always liked Seagate drives -- for the most part. I've had a few bad ones along the way; doesn't matter who makes it. You just need to make sure you don't have one of those that isn't quite right to begin with. In closing, I have considered that the drive could have been perfectly fine out of the factory, but was dropped / damaged in shipping -- especially around the Holidays which is when I purchased the first drive. If I have any problems with this replacement drive, I will be sure to update my review.
 Advertising said it was guaranteed for certain number of years, but if you go to the website and type in the serial number and model it will tell you that your guarantee period is a couple years less than the advertisement. It seemed to work okay but for the size and price I one of the company to feel confident to stand behind their product as advertised. Got a refund and bought something else.
 This drive died on me almost exactly a year to the day from when I ordered it from Amazon.  It'll still spin up, but it won't connect with any machine I connect it to. My guess is that Seagate just has garbage quality control on their controller boards, as this seems to be a painfully common problem with these drives. I've had hard disk failures before, but this is the first time I've had a new drive fail within a year. Needless to say, this is the last time I'm buying from Seagate. Don't waste your money.
 After losing data constantly shuffling between spare drives I finally absolutely needed a new disk. Everything I have used before is old and nearly worthy of being burned at the stake for necromancy for surviving this long, so my comparison of this exalted virgin being offered to my vile and lowly dragon cannot compare to the toil and trouble of crones to which I am accustomed. She has taken with delight every morsel and incantation, every eschewed indiscretion. If only I had not lost the evidence of old passions relinquished to age, for lo, they were vast and unimaginable, contemptible and virtuous, conceited and utterly denied.
 I did a bit of shopping around for a HDD, because I couldn't afford much. This drive seemed to review fairly consistently positive, and was the best bang for the buck that I could afford. (I'd have liked to get an SSD, but out of my budget!)<br/><br/>Got it fast, minimal fuss. Installed it with only a little fumbling (my first hard drive install!), and - so far - is working perfectly. Of course, I've only had it a few days; I'll try and remember to come back with updates if necessary!
 I bought this hard drive as a back up to my SSD (which has my operating system installed on) and it is more than I could ever need. 2 TB storage I think is is perfect amount, and since it runs at 7200 rpms, its pretty fast for a mechanical hard drive. I store pictures I have saved up for years, my Steam games, 3D files that I create for my 3D printer, movies, my entire music library, and back ups of  mine and other friends' computers. I plan on buying another one so I can mirror (Raid 1) the two drive together, so if one dies (for some unlikely reason), I will still have my second drive.
 After installing two of these drives in my freshly built Windows 10 PC, they clicked obnoxiously every 30 seconds or so, just like several other reviewers reported.<br/><br/>I switched the HDD controller on my motherboard from AHCI to RAID. This fixed the clicking issue. Now I only hear the clicking sound when the drive initializes on boot and when the drive re-initializes after sitting idle. I set the drives to mirror each other in a RAID 1 array, still no clicking.<br/><br/>The drives passed the SeaTools tests, so it seems like the clicking is due to the drive initializing over and over, not from a mechanical malfunction.<br/><br/>Even without the clicking, the drives aren't exactly quiet. Since I'm using the drive for storage, I don't need frequent access to the drives. In the Windows 10 power settings, I set the drives to turn off after being idle for 10 minutes, so they are now silent unless I'm actively using them.<br/><br/>There were reports of bad warranties, so I also called Seagate to verify that the warranty is valid. They gave me a date 5 years out, so the warranty looks good. These Barracuda Pro drives come with free data recovery if they crash, so that's a bonus. (Of course, redundant backups are the way to go--data recovery is a last resort option.)<br/><br/>In short: if your motherboard supports RAID and you're comfortable switching from AHCI, these drives should do the job. Otherwise, buyer beware.<br/><br/>PSA - If you switch your HDD controller to RAID when Windows is already installed in AHCI mode, your pc may not boot. I had to reinstall Windows after the switch. It's possible to install the necessary RAID drivers before the switch if you don't want to reinstall--ask Google for details.
 These are "desktop" drives but I have 4 of them in my Synology DS918+ and they're working fine. I was working on a budget and these fit right in. They would absolutely be fine for desktop use if you still need mechanical drives in a desktop.<br/><br/>The upgrade to one of Seagate's NAS drives does give you other features that make those drives better suited for NAS use, but these are "compatible". I will keep using them until one fails, at which point I'll probably switch to a NAS drive.
 I bought two of these for back-up storage and, so far - so good.<br/>They came well packaged in plain brown boxes with warranty brochure included.  Seagate website verified warranty good until Feb 2021.<br/>Both drives were easily formatted for Mac OS HFS+ Journaled using the Mac Disc Repair utility and appear to be working  flawlessly on a 27 " 2009 iMac and a 21.5" 2017 iMac, both running OS 10.13.6 (High Sierra).<br/>Time will tell, and I will update this review, if needed.
 Plugged in Drive, Booted PC up and heard it make a scratching noise, then power down. Turned pc off, panicked, and took drive out. Tried different cables, and a different pc, now it just clicks a couple of times and dies. Drive never worked, currently waiting on Seagate's response to RMA drive. I'll update this response if anything changes.<br/><br/>Update: I waited three business days for Seagate's support team to respond, when there original quote was 1 business day. Not only am i discouraged with getting a DOA device, now I'm annoyed at this company as a whole. I will be buying exclusively WD products for all my HDD's now.
 Seagate Barracuda's have always been reliable for me. I run them in my NAS which also acts as a Plex server, so it gets plenty of read/write action. It's no SSD, but I feel that this drive gives a lot of bang for the buck. Just make sure you're NAS has redundancy and you stagger the dates for new drive installations so you don't get multiple failures within days of each other (don't put  4 of these in a NAS on the same day or you will most likely regret it later when the drives ultimately start failing).
 Great for the price. Keep in mind that HDDs and even SSDs NEVER have the amount advertised. It all depends on how the company advertises it, the formatting you choose, and how your OS calculates it.<br/><br/>Companies use powers of 1000 to calculate capacity while Windows uses powers of 1024.<br/><br/>I wanted to mention that as I've seen reviews trashing the product about capacity. This has been the way of hard drives since I can remember,<br/><br/>Other than that, it was quickly recognized by Windows. Used Disk Management to create a partition and format it in NTFS-style.<br/><br/>Not much else to say. It's a storage device for me.
 Cool, quiet and spacious. CrystalDiskMark reports a sequential Q32T1 read rate of 225.6 MB/s and a write rate of 207.1 MB/s, while regular sequential clocks in at 211.2 MB/s reads and 203.0 MB/s writes. 4K performance is bad, because it's a mechanical hard drive. That's what you buy an SSD for. For general-purpose storage or even a gaming drive, this is absolutely fine. This is my second Seagate HDD and both have been nothing but smooth-sailing. In fact, I like this particular drive so much I'm going to buy another. That should tell you how much I think of it.
 Great hard drive for storage. Price is also very good. Your standard "green" hard drive that operates at 5400 RPM. Given the low price for such a large capacity hard drive, I immediately tested the hard drive using Seagate SeaTools, and it tested good. I also tested the hard drive transfer rate using HD Tach and it was holding steady at 180 MB/s. I plan on buying three more in a few months for my new computer build.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a large capacity hard drive to store data, this is it. I would only recommend a 7200 RPM hard drive such as a Western Digital Black if you need to access that data quickly and more frequently. I use this hard drive to store DVD rips and media files.
 So far, they appear to be a good storage medium. Only time will tell. The Crystal disc info assures me that the specs from Seagate are not misleading. These are between Enterprise and consumer grade drives in both quality and cost, I am using 1 drive in an HTPC server, (always running) and 1 as a backup of the first drive (stored unattached, put back in monthly for incremental backups). The drives perform as expected and the only drawback thus far is that with 5TB on it, it is just starting to have a noticeable difference in search times. Again, this would be expected from a high capacity drive. I am very satisfied with them considering I have exclusively used 6 Seagate 2TB Enterprise drives for the last 4 years (NO FAILURES)
 Everything looks okay so far.  Right out of the box its 4 power on hours according to SMART.  The drive is spinning at 5425 RPM and temperature is  95 F.  Its a few degrees cooler than my Hitachi 6TB but then again its not 7000 RPM. I'm going to do some testing and make sure this drive isn't a lemon.  I tested it with ATTO and its topping out at 190MB or so.
 I picked up the 12 TB version of this in March 2018 (1 month ago). So far, I have had zero problems with it. My computer recognized the drive with no problems, and created a 12 TB partition without incident. I have seen zero indications of any strange behavior or potential problems.<br/><br/>Guess that means I'm over the hump. Fingers crossed, hoping this drive lasts a long time.
 Good value for the size and speed.  It has provided me the ability to mirror my system drive of the same size, to this one, using Paragon imaging software.  This is great, since any failure of my system drive will not cause me to lose even  the ability to boot my machine.  This mirrored backup even boots just like the system drive.  Perfect backup solution!
 Works great like I knew it would. HP said it wouldn't work on my is8300 computer, so contacted Support by email and heard back later that day that it would work on this computer. Cloned the old hard drive OS and files to this new 2tb drive pulled old drive out and installed this new 2tb drive and computer booted up with no problems.<br/>This hard drive is working great and is very quiet, faster and gives me so much more storage I'll never run out of space.
 I've purchased a few of these to use as Game drives, both the 2TB model and the 4TB model of this lineup. All have been working great. They run quiet, they run cool, they are fast (200MB/s reads and writes, reliable seeking), and I have not encountered a failure condition on any of them. Definitely a huge improvement over Seagate drives from a decade ago, and priced well.
 Got the 2TB version and ran it as a secondary drive. Installed it on May 10, 2017 and it just failed today February 24, 2019, lasted less than 2 years. But before that it was working fine. Although it was my fault for not backing up properly since the signs started showing itself a week earlier and it should have stopped using it. Fortunately I backed up all the important documents and the only things I lost were around 600GB on installation files and games. It was halfway full btw. Currently running a recovery software to get some stuff back and will be replacing it with an 860 Evo from Samsung, more costly but worth it for data integrity. Giving it 2 stars cause it worked for a while, but if you get this or any HDD get a new one every year cause it won’t last longer than that. My old pre-built computers had HDDs that lasted 7 years straight, this one around 1 and a half years.
 Its a pretty nice drive, had issues installing it at first but thats just because of my SATA cables that didnt quite fit right. Its only been a month since the install and its still running fine and quite as well. On the first day I transferred 710GB worth of steam games onto it off the old drive and got a decent transfer rate (around 120 mbs) and it did fine for that so I'm not to worried about it dieing on me.
 Received this drive DOA, requested a replacement and received it DOA as well.  Only silver lining is that I never managed to get data onto the drive, then have it fail on me.  Will be purchasing a different brand entirely.
 I prefer WD products, but I have to say, this thing is super fast and QUIET.  Way more quiet than the 5 TB WD Black, which is probably the noisiest drive I've ever owned.  If it lasts, I may have to give Seagate another chance because typically they are cheaper and die faster than WD.
 hey i just go this harddrive about a week ago and as soon as i unboxed it i could tell how sturdy it is, though do not be fooled. looks can be deceiving. for the past couple of days, when my pc is idle, i can hear the harddrive as if it was trying to boot up for a second then quiet down then boot up again then quiet down.<br/><br/>i noticed this when i was laying down ready to go to bed last night and today as well. it sounds as if its trying to spin for second then shuts off then tries to spin again then shuts off. not sure what the deal is but my last hdd did not do this. upon reading the reviews i see that another guy had the same problem.<br/><br/>luckily i am still under the amazon return policy and can still get a "brand new" replacement. hopefully its brand new as advertised. if it wasnt for the return policy i wouldnt expect much from a manufacturer's warranty. the RMA process is all the same like any other company. you return it, get a FIXED HDD (refurbished) or IF you are lucky MAYBE get a new one. but you never know until you test it out.<br/><br/>other than that, we'll see how the replacement one goes. i will update this as time goes by. thanks!
 I always use Seagate for my hard drives.  Internal ones seem to last much longer than external.  I do not like how much space is reserved and not accessible.  With this size, it was almost 1 TB which is a significant amount of space.  I do know that is with all drives though, but that is the reason for my 4 star.
 This drive is a newer one than what came in my new Dell XPS computer and it's priced a very good price point. I mainly use it as a backup "cloned" drive for my desktop computer which is very, very fast due to it being equipped with 16Gb of Optane memory. It rivals a pure SSHD despite being a conventional hard drive. This is the way to go for a performance desktop computer without having to spend a huge amount for an actual SSHD.
 I've been running this drive for a while now after my 2TB drive decided to die and so far I have been very happy with this drive.  It seems to perform great and so far I haven't had any issues with it at all.
 I bought this drive more than a year ago. I got it, plugged it in, and it just wasn't identified by my computer. I've tried everything. The cables and everything else is just fine yet it doesn't work. I was going to file a return, but I soon forgot about it sadly due to the fact that I am so busy and I did't need the drive right away. My old hard drive is finally starting to bug out now and I found this drive sitting there in my computer. I tried once again, to fire the computer up with it in but the computer still couldn't identify it. I saw some 2 year warranty that sea gate keeps with its hard drives, and I was hoping I could use that warranty now before the two years are up. If any one knows how I can do so, it would be greatly appreciated.
 Drive lasted maybe a few months before it died, and I returned it for another hard drive that lasted maybe a couple of weeks. After that the next drive I got died the day I installed it, and now the latest one I got is DOA.... Please do yourself a favor and do some research on these drives so you can save yourself money and time, since it seems that all of these 3TBs of this batch are terrible and die for a large majority of people based on the articles I have read around the internet.
 So far so good.  I've used seagate for many years and am happy with the results.  Not as fast as a ssd, but then again I can't afford the price of a 1 tb  ssd.  Knock on wood, but so far I haven't had any drive failures.  Not to berate western digital, but I have had failures with them in the past.  All of them can and will fail.  For me seagate seems to last longer.  Of course folks will argue, but whatever.  I would recommend this product to anyone as it's a  crap shoot anyway. It'll do the job performance wise anyway.
 I ordered the drive two weeks ago, but it turned out the Seagate warranty already ended last month. Doesn't make any sense. How can a warranty end before had even bought the drive? Are these used drives? So far the drive is working well, but given the reviews, I see here it could break any minute and I have no warranty coverage. I asked Seagate customer care for a warranty extension (we'll see what they say).<br/><br/>Update: Seagate said they can't do anything about the warranty. It appears the drive was part of an enclosure and being sold as an external drive. I don't understand how Amazon would allow this to happen. I have my precious data right now on a hard drive that has ZERO warrantly.
 I purchased this hard drive to replace the one that had failed in our 27” iMac. The hard drive fit perfectly and all of the plugs in the computer had an appropriate spot in the hard drive! Our computer is up and running again and I am highly satisfied.
 So far so good. i got 3 of them on my first order then one more about  5 days later or so. packageing was good, they can make some noise and get kinda hot easily. Easy fix, fan controler and extra fans on the way!
 Works as expected.  Does not come with any cables but I did not need any as I was able to use the ones I already had. I am using this to run Windows 10 and have not had any problems. This is the second one of these that I have purchased. The first was over a year ago for use in a DVR. and it is still working fine. I would definitely buy this again if needed.,
 I ordered this hard drive (the 2 TB) for all of my pictures and videos I have on my computer taking up tons of space. For 60 dollars it has been great so far (Will Update). It was easy to install, especially because my motherboard had two ports perfectly open. The only trouble I had was trying to find the hard drive once I booted the computer back up, but after I made my way to the disk management page it was right there. All I had to do after that was format it and name it, very easy! I (So Far) would recommend anyone looking for some space to keep pictures and videos this hard drive, it is a great price and the speeds are not bad although for my purposes it doesn't matter.
 I bought two of these to install in a Drobo DAS because they were advertised  as 7200 RPM. They are not, which is slowing the performance of the Drobo. If  I hadn't already installed them and used them I'd return them for that reason.
 I normally dont write reviews but this drive is so bad I dont want anyone to have to go through what I did, avoid at all costs.<br/><br/>TLDR: This drive is unpredictable at best and just plain doesn't work at worst. Buy a different hard drive, it doesn't work properly.<br/><br/>I got this drive as I had two 1tb drives running in a raid 1 setup, after deciding that it wasnt worth the risk to run the drives in raid 1 anymore I wanted a new drive that I could store everything on so I could reformat my old drives, I thought this one would work as mass storage. I was wrong. First to even get my system to recognize this drive I had to use command prompt which was the first red flag I should have noticed, after that it worked fine for a few days. I had some problems with my RAM which caused my entire windows to stop working for a period of time. after I got that fixed I started my computer up and this drive wouldnt initiate and gave me a broken I/O error. After spending a solid 4 hours trying to recover the data which I stored on it it finally worked again but I suspect it will crash again soon.
 Purchased this to use in the 3rd slot of my 2010 Mac Pro tower. It plugged right in and after a quick reformat using the DiskUtility to be Mac Journaled, I had it up and running in under 10 minutes! So far so good! I do video editing with large file sizes, and the 7400rpm of this drive is absolutely needed for that. Working great! I'll update if I have any issues with it.
 Bought and Installed two of these drives in a NAS over two months ago. No major issues as of yet. Only the future will tell.<br/><br/>You will have to reformat the drives to get them to work!<br/><br/>Update June 2018<br/>One of the drives has been giving smart data errors and my bios has been recommending me that the drive will fail imminently.<br/>Calling seagate has turned out to be a pain and hassle as I wasn’t able to get this drive set up in an rma correctly until 3 phone calls later.<br/>Also they will try to charge you for the rma process.<br/>Furthermore, such an expensive drive should not fail after a year of use.<br/>Also....even more disappointing for me personally; another seagate drive that I purchased in feb 2018 also failed a week after my initial drive failure 🙄
 Received two of these failed drives in a row received a replacement after the first one was defective), both defective. Both with the same exact problem.<br/><br/>My case: once about 200GB's is written to the drive, write speed then tops out at 1 MB/s with response times around 10K-25K ms. Tried on two different PC's with different cables for both drives.<br/>I switched back to Western Digital &amp; decided to order directly from them because apparently some people are receiving grey market drives from Amazon, which is apparently what's happening with these Seagate drives as well.
 I bought this drive to supplement storage capacity on workstation in our shop. It came bare bones, I have tons of SATA cables laying around so not a significant inconvenience. I have nearly a half dozen barraCuda drives in my primary rig at home and have been using them regularly in various sizes and styles for the last decade or so. This drive has performed as expected and was priced quite affordably. Would recommend to anyone looking for good, reliable storage solutions.
 I only used it for 3 minutes, connected it, turned on PC and a few seconds later i heard a loud TOCK...TOCK...TOCK...that continued until i turned off PC. Returned immediately.
 This hard drive's performance is way too slow, even after defragging it (be warned, it's a 5400 RPM drive). Very disappointed. Should have gotten one of Seagate's hybrid hard drives instead in the first place. :(<br/><br/>The 6GB capacity does make it useful for storing your movies &amp; as a backup drive, though.
 Been buying these for years. The old ones used to have a 5 year warranty, but now, only 2 years. I have had several go out on me in the past, but way after the warranty. I for the price, I suppose I get my money's worth. One thing though, always back up data, because in this day and age, you never know.
 I have 8 of these drives (4tb), thrown together in a couple of probox storage containers. Simple, easy and effective.<br/><br/>Sustained transfer is around 150-180m/s which is perfect<br/>These things are as durable as it gets<br/>Response time is great<br/>Easy, simple plug and play devices<br/><br/>For the price, there's nothing better for your storage needs. Really, there's nothing better for cheap, mass storage than this drive
 This HDD came highly recommended as the way to upgrade my PS4's memory, so I purchased it alongside a Nyko data bank. It was easy to install and worked perfectly for a year and a few months before stopping altogether suddenly. I've tried maaaany of methods of recovering data but none of them work with what I assume is a corrupted harddrive. I'm very disappointed that I've lost all of my data due to the poor durability of this item.
 Received a very old or refurbished drive.  Tried to register for warranty before installing and the Serial Number had an expired Warranty from July 2017 (purchased on in June 2018).  So this means it is either a very, very old drive or a refurbished one.  Returned to seller.
 Has been working great for ~400 hours of up time over the course of a couple months. It is faster than my other 7200rpm drive and has plenty of room to spare for all my games. I would definitely buy again because its a quality drive but I would rather have chosen a 3TB as it is the best value of GB per dollar.
 I just had 100's of GB's of data up and vanish on me today. Drive still reports the missing files as there (The space is still taken up) but I can't see them or interact with them. I should have listened to all the warnings, but I bought this anyways, DO NOT RELY ON THESE DRIVES, THEY ARE JUNK. Its a rotten shame too, cause it was a great HDD when it actually worked. Never again Seagate, never.
 I've used Seagate drives for a long time, and have never had any issues with them from normal use.  When I did my new build, it was an easy decision to go with this drive for the performance and the ease of use.  Definitely recommended for if you need a good drive for the money.
 Apparently a brand new unit - at this price, I half expected a refurbished unit, but the label shows a manufacturing date of December 2016, only two months ago, and there are no visible marks indicating otherwise.  Granted, only the label may be new, but it is working well so far,  It feels lighter than my older Western Digital drives - perhaps less metal, more plastic in construction - but that's not necessarily bad.  Only time will tell for sure.
 This is a fine disk drive which installed very easily. My old 5 year Hitachi drive was failing and I cloned it to the new drive without any issues. For the record I used AOMEI Partition Assistant Standard Edition, which took about more than 6 hours overnight to complete. My only issue with the drive is that it carries just a one year warranty; however, the price is unbeatable. Just remember if your going to clone you'll need the data and power cables or a USB box/station.
 This hard drive slowed down my whole computer - I have an SSD drive and 1 TB Hard drive setup.<br/><br/>I added this hard drive for the extra storage and this just slows down my whole PC. Its so slow whenever I try to open pictures on the hard drive that it just freezes for 10 - 15 seconds even when I try to rename a file........<br/><br/>Avoid this weak hard drive and spend the money to get something better.
 I exchanged my first drive because it has the most annoying tick and beep noise while idling that happens in a rhythmic pattern.  I thought the drive was a dud so I exchanged it for another one.  Well this annoying sound must be the norm for this Seagate drive because the new one is ticking and beeping at idle as well.  Nice drive performance, but if you want a quiet drive then this is not the one for you.  I'll give it a few more days, but I may be returning this new drive and switching to another manufacturer's drive.
 so far so good just installed it today and ran:<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>CrystalDiskMark 5.2.0 x64 (C) 2007-2016 hiyohiyo<br/>  Crystal Dew World : http://crystalmark.info/<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>* MB/s = 1,000,000 bytes/s  SATA/600 = 600,000,000 bytes/s]<br/>* KB = 1000 bytes, KiB = 1024 bytes<br/><br/>  Sequential Read (Q= 32,T= 1) :  206.459 MB/s<br/>  Sequential Write (Q= 32,T= 1) :  197.800 MB/s<br/>  Random Read 4KiB (Q= 32,T= 1) :  1.532 MB/s    374.0 IOPS]<br/> Random Write 4KiB (Q= 32,T= 1) :  1.418 MB/s    346.2 IOPS]<br/>  Sequential Read (T= 1) :  203.024 MB/s<br/>  Sequential Write (T= 1) :  196.289 MB/s<br/>  Random Read 4KiB (Q= 1,T= 1) :  0.618 MB/s    150.9 IOPS]<br/>  Random Write 4KiB (Q= 1,T= 1) :  1.323 MB/s    323.0 IOPS]<br/><br/>  Test : 1024 MiB  E: 0.0% (0.2/1863.0 GiB)] (x5)   Interval=5 sec]<br/>  Date : 2016/11/23 18:30:52<br/>  OS : Windows 10   10.0 Build 14393] (x64)<br/>  The speeds are good so I am happy.
 bought 2, one as a main, one as a back up. as many others say, its noisy. it might be the casing its in, but its noisy. its not a tap, its more like the platter is loose, that kind of noise. but otherwise its fast, and it works so far. can't say much, these reviews are either going to be good, or terrible with horrible stories of failure, and i will be back if that is the case.
 Let's get some things straight, this is the 2017 version which people confuse with the 2016 version. The read speed is more than acceptable but the write is atrocious even for a drive in it's category. The sequential Read is averaging about 180MB/s for me and the sequential write is 80 to 90MB/s.<br/><br/>Lets talks pros:<br/>-Quiet<br/>-Slim for a 3.5" drive<br/>-works great for MMO's and Storage<br/>-Seagate tools software is nice.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Slow write speed<br/>-You'll notice micro stutters in certain FPS games and a very unoptimized game like "Escape from Tarkov" is nearly unplayable. Took me about 10 minutes to load into a map.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I'm returning this because similar drives such as WD blue 5400rpm perform better in sequential writes. By the way this hard drive is not 7200rpm, it's 5900rpm. Attached is my crystal disk benchmark.
 I have an M.2 boot drive in my Windows 10 PC but it only has 500GB of storage. I bought the 6TB BarraCuda drive to replace a nearly full 2TB hybrid drive that was almost full and starting to run poorly. I was worried that the BarraCuda would have a hard time keeping up with my Steam games but it works just as well and in some cases better than my old hybrid drive.
 Did not come in Seagate packaging.  Only came with manual.  No cables.  Sure wasn't the Seagate experience.  For a full price product, it is disappointing.  The item does list as "packaging may vary".  Should read, may not come in original packaging so we know we are not getting the full retail experience.  If I want to sell this later, I'll not do as well as I would otherwise.
 Excellent piece of equipment,  good operating temp, nice stable HDD slimline fits nicely!<br/><br/>Love Seagate
 I now own 6 of these drives. They are fast, run cool, and are quiet. they are also 3/4 inches tall so helps with airflow. No SMART errors on any of them. They are a bargain. Hopefully the last hard drives I will buy as SSDs come down in price/GB.
 I have 3 iDsonix USB hard drive mounts.(from Amazon) I did not install any of the 6 Seagate 4TB BarraCuda hard drives in my computer. I simply shut down my iDsonix drop one or 2 of the 4TB Seagate in, turn the iDsonix back on. I have 2 - 2 slot iDsonix's so in reality I can add and or change 16TB to my computer in less than a minuet.  To go on the internet I simply turn off the iDsonix.<br/>This Seagate 4TB BarraCuda hard drives is just simply the lowest price to pay per 1 TB for very reliable storage.  Just simply the best combination for 100% reliable private storage.
 Hello<br/><br/>Got this drive barely used it for few months. dead drive after few months lost all my data<br/>won't buy it again and most likely will need to file for RMA on this one as i have no choice. usually a hard drive get noise or click sound when going bad so at that time you can back up your data but this one just went bad and no indications of anything such bad product for sure
 Works as advertised.  I bought these as replacements for Seagate Barracude drives that failed on me.  While I haven't had any issues with this drive (*yet*), I'm waiting to see what the longevity is since I've had quite a few Seagate BarraCuda drives fail in the past.  So far so good after a month or so.
 Bought this hard drive and days after putting into my pc. It only works on and off. This moment you see the hard drive the next moment it I'm getting no bootable device.
 Very nice hard drive!  I replaced a 1TB hd with this 2TB hard drive.  Used Macrium Reflect to clone the drive and boom,I was done!  There is no paperwork,no cables, no hardware in the box, just the drive.  Since I was doing a straight swap, I didn't need it!  I am happy with this new drive.  No issues to report.
 It must be a very durable  hard drive because it arrived wrapped in only the anti-static wrapper and a paper mailing envelope. There was not a box or anything to protect it from abuse. This is definitely not the way to ship a delicate electronic device. I cloned my old data drive with about 3TB of data to it and then ran a disk check on it. There were no errors or bad sectors. Amazing!
 It has a lot of space but something that would happen on a lot of modern games was the game would crash and lock my entire computer up.  After putting said games on a SSD though they worked flawlessly.  If you're going to buy this to put games on I recommend getting an SSD to either put your OS so this can be completely dedicated to reading games files, or use the SSD for games you notice this HDD can't load fast enough.(Some examples in my case are DOOM, Fallout New Vegas, and Forza Horizon 3).
 For the money, can't beat it. Installed and up and running in a few minutes and I have myself enough storage for the next year of photography and videography work. Only wish I was smart enough to realize I would have to purchase an extra SATA cable separately, as I'm quite far from any electronics store, but can't fault them for my stupidity.
 The remaining one still works, it's quiet and has decent speed for a hard drive. The other two failed after a few days of usage, one had several bad sectors, the other one simply died. I ended ordering 10TB HGST, those still wortk.
 After 30 days. I purchased Two. Both Hard drives clicking!  Failure eminent!!! I will never buy Seagate again. A coworker bought four 2.5” 4TB drive all have forced reformatt and lost valuable information!! I have learned my lesson!! Just say NO! To seagate.
 So far, so good. Its still too early to rate a hard drive, but I have no issues right now. I ordered three of these and they are in my server, constantly being read and written to. These were not meant to be used as server hard drives, but they are doing great. My next purchase for hard drives will be the same brand, but high capacity. Great value for the price.
 I bought this and the first one worked for an hour the it was DED, big surprise. Contacted Amazon for a replacement, in a day and a half I got it and well, it worked for a week! Performance in 2 days was over the roof. In a few days the drive got slower and noiser. Then it died. BIG Surprise. I don't know if I should bother asking Seagate instead of Amazon since Amazon's return system is fustrating for me.
 Thankfully I bought the 3TB version of this drive as a storage drive for misc stuff that's already backed up on externals.<br/><br/>It runs like a tortoise and write speeds are just insulting. Shoulda learned to stay away from this company after my Free Agent died years ago and nearly lost me all of my data.<br/><br/>F*** you, Seagate.
 probably the best drive for just about anyone with computers updating constantly making most computers slower this drive holds that back for quite some time what normal person would use a 10TB drive to full capacity probably none because by the time they would have filled it they are probably already upgraded to a new computer.<br/>Probably the best uses are for video editors or photo editors or PC gamers who wanna store their entire game library on it!
 This hard drive is a great price for 2TB. The computer we put this on has a dedicated SSD (solid state drive) for the operating system and we added this on just for storage. So far it has performed very nicely. File transfers are quick and there doesn't appear to be much, if any, lag time in accessing anything on the drive. It's too early to rate how this drive holds up over time, but so far I'm happy.
 Despite the large 4TB capacity, this is possibly the quietest hard drive I've ever experienced.  Solid build, extended 5-year warranty, well worth the extra money for this Pro version compared to standard Barracuda.
 The drive works well once it gets going but getting it going takes a few seconds. This will make a good back up drive or storage drive but you'll want something faster on the uptake for your main drive. It's going along well enough for now but I'll be getting something faster soon. That being said, it's a good drive so far and I'm pleased enough with it.
 The hard drive works alright. However when it came I I noticed the plastic by around the Sata port was cracked. It’s not a huge issue, however when I plugged the cable in it would click properly. I did manage to get it to work. I really just didn’t want to deal with the haste of sending it back in and getting another. I assume it was damaged in shipping, because it came in a box with some other products I ordered and it wasn’t secured. I’m still giving 5 stars because the hard drive works fine, and I got it within two days. Hope this helps
 This is a good hard drive for what it is... The listing leaves a lot out and I wanted to make sure to put something out there so someone in the future can be sure. I bought the 4TB 256mb cache drive in January 2018. It arrived as a BARE DRIVE with no accessories. I wasn't advertised as a bare drive, so that was a surprise. Also, I couldn't find any conclusive specs on this drive's spindle speed and decided to chance it- mistake. This is a 5400RPM drive. My NAS is detecting 5425 rpm to be specific. All my other hard drives are 7200rpm, so I can't use it to replace a dying drive in a RAID array and have to use it on its own.
 Drive got here doa. -Dead on arrival- Went to rma it told drive didn't meet requirements to be rma'd.Called Seagate the manufacturer of drive and was told hard drive was no longer in warranty.I just bought this drive.It's not even a month old .
 My operating system drive on my HP Z820 Workstation went south a couple months ago. The drive didn't fail completely so it took me 3 horrible weeks to figure out that it was the OS drive. I had a secondary 1TB data only drive which became my new OS drive and this 2TB became my new secondary data only drive. Smooth sailing so far.
 I love Seagate HDD's (I have 9 3TB HDD by them - so I know Seagate), but this one was a lemon. Installed it and long behold I got a 'Spin Count Error' took the drive out and tried in another PC, just as a troubleshooting step - same thing. Used diagnostic software to try to repair the error - no go. Now I am getting another one as a replacement - but I've been waiting for about a week and no drive! What the heck Amazon - I see that you have them in stock!! Can I recommend this drive? Maybe - just don't be surprised if you need to replace it.
 It's only a 3.7 TB drive and it comes set up in two partitions. 300GB is a lot of space to just be missing, and having to deal with a preset partition on a factory new drive is unacceptable.
 This was brand new as described. No issues installing or setting up this drive. This is a bare drive packed in quality packing for shipping. It is not a retail box. It was new and fully warranted. I recomend this to anyone that can use a basic screwdriver and internet search to see how to install. It is very easy to install on most desktop. I put this into a 4 Drive NAS with 3 other 2TB drives.
 I am always nervous ordering HDDs through shipment because of likely hood of damage.  This drive showed up without damage and is performing as expected.  I use this drive for video editing and have had no issues with data speeds.
 Been a WD user my whole life and figured I would test out Seagate.  I've purchased dozens of hard drives and have not once purchased one that did not come with screws and data cable.  Guess I'll update with a proper review once I order the rest of the equipment I need.
 Installed easy, as I would expect<br/>Just the hard drive in this well-packaged box, no cables and just basic warranty documentation - for the price who would expect more?<br/><br/>Took a while to format (which is to be expected on a fresh install), but it's running fine now
 So far, so good. I did some stress test on the drive I got no error. I read some people got some noise issues but the one I have is very quiet. If anything happen I will edit my review but so far everything seems to be OK.
 Seagate BarraCuda Internal Hard Drive 2TB ordered is a replacement for same make/model that NAS box reported impending drive failure errors.  Drive snaps into cradle and inserted into drive bay.  NAS recognized it immediately and began setting up the array with three other Seagate BarraCuda Internal 2gb hard drives.  I recommend this drive.
 I purchased this the other day to expand my storage space on my desktop. The hard drive arrived in one of those envelopes with absolutely ZERO bubble wrap or something to cushion the drive. In fact the drive was physically damaged on the front, and the back of the antistatic bag looks like someone dropped it on the ground several times. There are actually little holes all over the back.  I was under the impression this was a new drive. I won't even bother putting it in my PC. It's going straight back.
 This has been in nearly 24/7 use* for a few months without any issues. The drive is reasonably fast and works well as media storage for a home server accessed by multiple clients requesting large media files.<br/><br/>*I wouldn't necessarily recommend this drive for 24/7 use, as a NAS or server drive is better suited for constant operation. However, the price was right, and it's performed admirably for me.
 Had a data write speed of of about 1 MB/S, it took forever to try to copy my data to it, I contacted Seagate Tech support and they told me to just return the Drive which I did with no problems.
 The drive works great and has nominal noise levels. The later is due in part to the fact that it is a 5400rpm drive not the advertised 7200rpm. This does add latency and lowers responsiveness over a 7200rpm drive. But that is ok for me because as of now nothing on my pc is mission critical. As a side not make sure to set the drive as GPT not MBR if you plan on using the drive as your main drive. If you dont know what that is look up both and see its uses and follow the instructions to set the drive during installation of the os youre using.
 These Hard drives WILL fail. I have had nothing but problem after problem with seagate drives. Internal and external. From BSOD, boot failures, Master Boot Record corruption, critical process errors.  These are awful drives. Awful. This drive failed from the very first installation of windows.<br/><br/>Nothing but western digital black and blue for me from this point on. Seagate is a manufacturer of trash.
 I've never had a problem with Seagate hard drives but this one died after 2 months. It failed just 3 days outside of my window to return it to Amazon. Now I have pay to ship it back to Seagate under the warranty. Really annoying.
 Had to replace the hard drive on a HP Touchsmart  320 desktop with Windows 10 after the factory hard drive crashed. I simply loaded the start files from the Microsoft website from another computer to a jump drive, removed the old HD and installed the Seagate HD. Plugged the jump drive into the computer and turned it on. Followed the on screen instructions and was like new in less than 30 minutes!
 Works fine so far. Easy to install. Would have been nice if the cables and installation software had come with it but it was easy to install even without the software. Bear in mind - even though it is rated for 4 TBs, the formatting takes up quite a few GBs and it will show less than 4 TB available. No way to get around that. That is how it is with all hard drives but just be aware of it.
 I’ve had no problems with it.  People always seem to have drives be bad when I read reviews.  I’ve never had a drive go bad in 17 years.  Really only one but it was my fault I dropped it.  The price was great on this and runs fast.
 Just installed into my video / gaming pc today.  Setup was no problem, and it has read and write speeds between 200-300mb/s.  Will update if it runs into issues, but my unit is extremely quiet compared to what other reviewers have claimed.
 I just installed the drive, but so far so good.  I can't believe how inexpensive I can purchase such a large drive, 8TB!  As long as this drive continues to hold up, I'll come back add an additional star.
 I bought a pair of these drives to replace 2 x 3TB Seagate Barracuda drives in a RAID 1 enclosure that is one of my TimeMachine backup destinations (the other 2 being 4TB RAID 1 sets). Took a while (over a day!) for the first backup of 2.96TB to be made, but now it's done they're running as expected so far...
 This is my 2nd 8TB HDD. First one is BarraCuda and this pro version is a lot faster and more stable. I also considered WD Black, but black did not have 8tb and cache was only 128mb while this one is 256mb. large memory = more data handling
 Nornaly never have issues<br/>Stuck it in windows install went smooth<br/>Was delaying  taking quite along time to install<br/>Pulled it threw it on hdd scam shows bad sectors<br/>Second I’ve bought in. Amonth first one was fine<br/>Tosses this one out in the backyard pile of junk or just unlucky you be the judge 🤷🏼‍♂️
 Still working great 6 months later.  I've always had great luck with Seagate (knocking wood right now - just in case)  arrived quickly but the shipping could have used a few more air pillows.  there weren't enough and you could tell this thing was jumbling around inside the shipping box.
 Of course I cannot comment a lot on this particular drive as I just bought it and it looks ok, but I gave five stars for their previous "cousins" - I have several of them purchased in the past working at great performance and reliably. I went for this particular model for my history with them in the past. Recommended.
 I am one of the unlucky ones. Drive went out after working flawless for quite a while. It was used as a storage drive and not running the OS. Came back to it one day as not even recognized by computer. Ran a scan and bad sectors all over the place.  I understand it happens, just doing a data recovery takes such a long time on larger size drives. I will need to swap this drive out after i am done, but data is most important to me.
 I use it for game storage/running. got two 2TB's and a 1TB i'll likely be replacing in time with another one of these.  I would still recommend SSD or M.2 for OS drive, and SSD gaming is a very very very viable thing today as it's almost impossible to hit write limits without trying, but when you need a s-ton of storage you can't go wrong with this.
 I bought this 2TB HDD after the WD 1TB HDD Green model started to malfunction after six years in my Gateway tower. This new HDD is fast and very quiet, whereas the WD was usually making some sort of ruckus. Installing Linux Mint and then back to Windows 10 was quick and easy. I am satisfied. Cheers.
 Installed the drive on my windows PC. No problem installing and having windows recognize it as a storage drive. I started transferring the data over and everything seemed to work great. I had no trouble using the new drive for a few days until received an error on windows and the drive disappeared. Everything I tried did not work and it appears all my data stored on the drive is lost now. Grateful I copied all my pictures and did not just move them but everything else gone.<br/><br/>Positive thing was Amazon sent me a new one very fast. It is now installed and seems to be working again. Only time will tell.
 I bought this to replace a failing drive in a RAID 0. I decided to go larger and just use this one drive instead of two 1.5 TB drives. The performance is really good and I have no complaints. Games load at decent speeds for being an HDD and not an SSD. I have plenty of space for recorded gameplay as well.
 Replaced my 1tb hdd with this 4tb hdd I got this when it was going for $98 free 2 days prime shipping great price for a 4tb hdd I mostly use it to store backup photos and steam games works great
 I've attached a speed test for you to compare yourself. It appears to be a good drive for the price. Long term endurance is an unknown though.
 Plug it in and it works - simple.  I used it in a recent build along with an AMD Ryzen 1200 processor &amp; an ASRock AB350M-HDV motherboard.  There's really not much else to it - lots of space for music, videos and today's HUGE game files(Wolfenstein: The New Order is 50 GBs!!).
 Got sent a broken hard drive, I heard Seagate drives were trash, now I know for sure. When I popped in the drive I ordered, first I find that there is one bad sector off the bat, which I would have given a pass... But when I tried to put files into it, couldn't. I tried format it, nothing but errors. After a few hours of trying to make this dumpster fire of a hard drive work, I finally found a solution, that is to not buy Seagate again.
 Got this 4TB HDD 7200rpm to work with my 120gb Optane memory in my tower. As expected fast fast fast and in today's market for under a 100.00 with next gen Optane over 60gb the systems operate as expected. Under 60g the smaller first gen design Optane overheats. Pairs nicely with PC as expected.
 Love it/these!  I've got 2 of these (the 2nd 1's been running for 2days now as we type ;) w/ the 1st one being ~1yr. old.  Stable AND reliable, these are not the fastest but fast enough; w/ work etc., most important to me is stability &amp; reliability vs.speed :)
 So far works as expected, that what you should get from brand name product.
 This Seagate 1TB BarraCuda SATA 6GB/s 7200 rpm hard drive works great. No issues with connection, formatting for use, or using. Absolutely 100% runs as expected. Performance is as it should be. No heat issues even under large file heavy writes. Overall Highly recommend!
 Could not get the BIOS (yes, old PC) to work with the Seagate 2TB BarraCuda SATA 6Gb/s 64MB Cache 3.5-Inch Internal Hard Drive (ST2000DM006). It threw SMART errors, only 4GB size under BIOS setup, 128GB under Windows. GParted would not work with it either.<br/><br/>But the WD Blue 2TB Desktop Hard Disk Drive - SATA 6 Gb/s 64MB Cache 3.5 Inch - WD20EZRZ worked great. Zero trouble. Installed, formatted and in service in under 20 minutes.
 I am impressed with this drive. It is silent and fast. The speed is based purely on subjective observation. The quietness is a fact. I've owned many computers and have installed additional internal hard drives in almost all of them. This is easily the one that makes the least noise.<br/><br/>12/29: After using it for a while, there is some noise when it starts thrashing, but it's still pretty quiet.
 A very fast and  very quiet 6TB hard drive. I did not want to use a NAS hard drive in my unit and this was available. It's my first try with Seagate in many years so we shall see how it works over time. For now it spins up quick, no vibration and no real sound during normal use.
 Arrived open. The box was open, the bag containing the drive was open. This was supposed to be a brand new drive but it looks like it's a used drive.
 I have 4 of these drives and didn't run into a problem with any.  These are definitely faster than traditional HD's, but only 4 stars for gaming due to SSD's out there.  I wanted something that was cheap, had decent space, more speed than the average non-SSD hard drive, and helped out with some encoding/decoding speeds and these are about as good as you can get before SSD's and high prices.
 These drivers require special software to be set into a GBHT format and then you have to create the partition for Windows to even recognize it. Why the hell would Seagate not have already any of this
 Nice Drive, ok to install  but sadly no Mounting Screws provided hence the 3 stars overall,  had to Google for the drive spec pdf so I could find out I needed 4 6-32 x1/4 screws.
 Works as advertised. Just installed... Will update review if hard drive ends up failing at any point. The only thing that worried me was that this was just shipped in a soft padded envelope instead of a box, which isn't ideal. You don't know if the hard drive went through a beating while being shipped. Other than the packaging, so far so good

However, after examining it, it appears to run at 5,400 not 7,200.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I did not realize this until I already had tons of files in place. So, too late for me to return it. Just be aware.
 I own around 20 of these drives. This last years batch I have returned 2 and another just failed. Do not use these drives unless you are backing up your data with external drives or some other means. The quality has gone downhill and the warrenty drives they send you may last a year if lucky.
 replaced a crashed hard drive in a couple year old computer, and all I had to do was the simple physical install then my boot disc to reload Windows and be back in business (minus all my original data from the dead old hard drive). This one is quick and twice as big for a great price.
 Great price, great spec, working great.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, this is a spinning metal hard drive - it will either work, or it won't.  And this one does.  Hopefully it will be reliable, though at this price I'd always be careful to only have well backed up data on this drive, just in case.<br/><br/>But as of now, this is great.
 Harddrive came in open box. Item have scatches on the back plastic.... Luckily it works fine but from time to time makes a loud ticking noise.... It gets down fast. I may not be well versed with using tech stuff but i have never experienced such annoyance at a product for its shortcomings. I also have a laptop and its hard drive doesnt make any noise and doesnt heat up at all. Granted it is smaller... Someone let me know if that is a factor....
 Amazon is really a good company. I have ordered a variety of items from them and they always shipped fast and packaged very good !. I even purchased a ridding lawn mower and it came in perfect condition.<br/>These drives are very fast I get transfer rates of up 204 mb/s and steady at 190 mb/s when  transferring 600GB libraries. They are quite and stay pretty cool. I mainly use them for video and audio production libraries that need fast access speeds. They have a 5 year warranty so my hope is they last a long time.  Keep up the good work Amazon.  Thank you !
 I was able to use this on my aging Mac Pro and it works flawlessly!
 This drive has been hard at work in my server.  Not really a lot you can say about a drive other than it has a lot of room for storage and has thus far been really reliable.
 i really like these hdds but the way it was packed for shipping was frightening sept. 6 2018 the hdd died and i discovered big A has a crappy warranty i'll never buy from amazon again spend a rear load of money and get the shaft no consumer protection here only big a's get rich quick while i go broke buying a's junk even got the square trade which is no square trade either they have screwed me every time 10 months and it's dead next time i'll read the fine print to see what kinda bad deal i get from amazon
 HDD storage capacity and function are both fine and as expected. Not much to complain about.  But the con I saw was I had a difficult time looking for appropriate screws to mount the HDD. For a few cents more, the inclusion by the manufacturer for mounting screws would have made installation so much easier. I rated installation a 1 because of this deficiency, otherwise installation would have been a breeze.
 Previously bought another vendors drive and had problems from the beginning. This drive is huge and I had no problems with installation nor the performance of the drive. I use this drive as a storage of files and backups and use a Solid-state Drive (SSD) as the primary boot drive.
 Super fast and has a great amount of storage space. I use it as a gaming HDD and it is perfect for the role, it’s quiet and all of the games I installed on it fully load in seconds and it has enough space to fit all of my new games. Since games and all other forms of electronic media are taking up more and more space as time goes on, getting good quality, high capacity drives like this are essential for a good experience in the long run.
 This is a great hdd for storage.  You can definitely run an operating system no problem on this with good boot times.  But for OS I recommend a ssd. For photo, video, and game storage this is a great option.  I store all my games on this hdd and they still load fairly quickly.
 I have purchased and used this HD in the past with no problems.  This time, please see the photo to see how amazon packaged it.
 Due to an injury and sickness, I was unable to try to install this harddrive until the return window had closed. I tried to install it on three different computers with no success. Neither computer would recognize it. It was properly installed to SATA connections.<br/><br/>What do I do since I cannot return it? Shall I tell others that Seagate hard drives ordered from Amazon cannot be trusted?<br/><br/>Bob Winton<br/>bwint38@yahoo.com
 I bought this drive to use in an external enclosure as an emergency backup for my Synology NAS.  This drive is quiet, reliable, and barely gets warm.  I guess filling these hard drives with helium really makes a difference.
 Fast and quiet<br/><br/>Replaced a 8 drive (5TB) RAID set with 4 of these new drives.  Got incredible speeds, less noise, less heat and did I say they are fast?<br/><br/>Wonderful upgrade to my 8700k PC.
 Received this product and it was DOA. I will be sending it back.
 The drives are outside of the manufacturer's warranty date. The drives sold are not for resale as internal HDDs. They are removed from an external drive enclosure (which voids the warranty) and then repackaged as internal drives.<br/><br/>I had to contact Seagate support and they verified that the serial numbers for the drives I received were actually internal components for the Seagate Expansion product.
 2 TB storage is enough for me store all my games and other applications. I cloned my previous hard drive to this one and has been working perfectly for about 3 months so far. As with any mechanical drive, I can hear the standard clicks working inside my PC. Besides that, everything is running smoothly along side my SSD.
 I bought this HD in Amazon and picked up in a vacation trip to usa. When I went back home I plug the the HD and it didn't work at all. It makes a sound at the beginning, the OS recognizes it but it doesn't work.<br/>Really disappointed with HD. I will never buy a HD like this. I will buy a SSD instead.
 Ordered this drive from Amazon in September 2017, March of 2018 it died. It of course is out of Seagate warranty as that apparently expired in 2014. So Amazon sells you old drives and provides zero RMA capability. Seagates, based on the 6 I bought last year seem to have about a 25% failure rate. Buy WD over Seagate and buy from someplace you can get support when the drive dies as there is no warranty on these drives. If I could give zero stars I would...
 This hard drive is large size but the data transfer spead rate is very slow. I plug it in by USB 3.0, the speed was so small. What reason made a large capacity hard drive with very slow speed.
 tired of too many drives?<br/>replaced the 1TB that came in the Cybertron BOX<br/>replaced external seagate 1.5 TB on USB3.0 that kept disappearing<br/>faster than expected; but its on a mew motherboard, which probably makes the difference<br/>future proofed for another 5 years maybe
 These drive have always been a good drive for my use. I have never had any issues with them. As always make sure you check with Sea Gate to see if they have any new firmware updates. The new firmware updates will keep the drive from failing do to out dated firmware.
 it's cheap, so don't have super high expectations. It works fine for my purposes though. (mirror'd pair in a synology nas for backups.)
 Replacement for a 2TB that died.  Plug and Play.  No problems.  Take out the old ~ mount the new ... plug in the wires ... boot up.  Windows will download the drivers.  Have no clue how durable it will be ... (longevity).  All it is, however, (in my configuration) is a storage drive.
 I returned the 1st one because it wouldn't  detect. I had the same problem with the replacement one. I had to go seagate's sight and download their disc wizard. After that it worked. There are NO instructions that come with it just a warranty paper, so you just have to know enough figure that out on your own. No other hd of mine has needed this.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R36OT3I34FTRSB"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+nEPnjHNS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1iXwujnM2S.png"/> High capacity but not without issues. One of two drives I bought had a really high pitch whine. Back to Seagate it goes.
 Installed this in a new Dell 8920, as the secondary data drive.  Using an SSD as the main system/boot because starts up very fast, from off to windows desktop in less than 30 seconds.  Highly recommend using an SSD as your system drive, and then a regular (non-SSD) as your secondary and data drive.
 Went bad at 33 days. Now can't return.
 I've been buying Seagate drives for 25 years.  The new 8TB drive replaced a storage drive that gave up after nine years.  Always satisfied with Seagate!
 Easy to install (thanks youtube) and holds lots and lots of por....music and games. Transfers speeds work nothing crazy fast. If you need more space on your computer this is a great buy.
 Only a week in on the 4T, but so far so good.  Easy to install and the Seagate software made portioning simple.  Use it for photographs and other data and documents, but keep an external (4TB) hd as a grandfather system.  My only issue was trying to find the spindle speed.  A lot of info shows it as 7200, but once mounted it tests as 5400.  For my needs this is still fast enough, but could be a problem if using as a boot or gaming disc.  For the price / gb this is the best drive out there.
 I had high hopes for this drive, however I am fortunate that it was the last piece of hardware that I was going to install in the PC I am building. I also tested this drive on my current PC via a USB3 external enclosure and the system did not find it.<br/><br/>Returning this drive and purchasing something else.
 I have a pair of 2TB's mirrored (RAID1) in a desktop tower acting as server.  They have been running for over 14 months with absolutely no problems.  Both disks still register as OK in the disk utility.  For HDD's, Seagate is it.  I had a 3TB drive fail in short order, but there's an entire story with those about a flood in Thailand...
 I had one that lasted 4 or 5 year's and suddenly started may a warning noise I should have recognized as failure sign. Would have been nice to have a inexpensive data recovery option instead of a flat rate $500 fee. Still l bought another because they are good quality drives. I just didn't change it when the noise frist occurred.
 Great value. Considered the 2TB drive which was only $15 (33%) more, but I was trying to keep costs down and 1TB is plenty for me for now. I can always expand later on.
 Great performance for the money, very quiet... If you are just looking for a all-around performance, including gaming and not too concern with SSD, then look no further....
 Installed the hard drive...windows recognized it and I setup a new partition.  All seemed to be great....then I went to transfer a directory to it from my main drive...suddenly a loud screeching noise started every few seconds as windows attempted to access the drive and write to it. Errored out...windows lost it. Then the Bios wouldn't detect it anymore. Dead.<br/><br/>Piece of junk. Bought this to replace a Seagate drive that died, too. My dumb move....won't happen again. Sent it right back. Shame because it had good specs and reviews on hardware sites. Hitachi or WD from now on.
 Been using 3 of the older models in my media server for over a year now. I just bought this one to top off the box.Mediasonic ProBox HF2-SU3S2 4 Bay 3.5" SATA HDD Enclosure - USB 3.0 &amp; eSATA Support SATA 3 6.0Gbps HDD transfer speed They are often on sale for less then $98.00. File transfer from drive to drive is incredibly quick.
 Died within months. Going WD RAD now for a RAID.
 I have got a lot of this drive and constantly using them and im always happy with them. I have got a one or two dead on arrival but they send me another and all was good.
 Used this in a pc I put together for my mother who wanted a system for Linux, which I added plos (PCLinuxOS).<br/><br/>I have used the Seagate hard drives for years now and the one time I had a drive go bad on me they were very good and prompt with the replacement (as it was just a bad drive).
 Comes unformulated and windows does not recognizes and can not format it.  I thought it was DOA and was not sure what to do. Need some other disc wizard software to format it.  I used Seagate disc wizard.
 I got this to back up both of my laptops completely and some extra data I want access more often. This drive more than covered my memory storage. I have had no issues. It does take some know how to set it up to use as a "flashdrive" (even though it is not flash memory). But it works well and is good value.
 I purchased this as a replacement for my computers 1 terabyte backup hard drive.  Cloned it quickly and replaced it with in an hour.  Great hard drive.  However, it is great for a backup hard drive and that alone I do not recommend it for installing an operating system.
 Perfect, packaging had some small wiggle room, and since I've worked in a shipping center, I know how they treat packages so this raised a small alarm. Hooked up and did a test, pulling 5.7 gb/s. Working perfect. Will come back if fails
 Ordered in early September, and began clicking and failing within 2 months, horrible product that I will not be repurchasing and nothing will be further purchased from Seagate.
 Seagate makes good drives, I have been using them for years and will continue to use them.  I have a home server populated with only Seagate drives that runs 24/7 in a RAID array.  I normally get between 4 to 5 years of life before I have to replace one.  That's over 35,000k hours of run time.
 4 months later, so far so good. I've had 4 seagate and 1 western digital drive since I started building computers, you can't go wrong with either one. Neither one of my 5 drives have broken. I like seagate more though bc of reliable history in my family and they're WAY quieter than the western digitals
 I had this hard drive for less than 9 months and it completely crashed.<br/>Error message: "Location is not available … The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error."<br/>As this is a hard drive that has not been touched, safely in my desktop all this time, this came out fo the blue.<br/>Catastrophic error; even recovery programs can't even read the hard drive.<br/>15% of reviewers gave this a 1-star review, and all of them had similar experiences.<br/>So you gotta ask yourself, would you take a 15% chance that your data completely disappears??
 Perfect solution for a Dish RV satellite system recorder which can't be more than 2TB and must have it's own power source and a Wally receiver. You will need a case or "Enclosure". I bought the Eaxer aluminum<br/>3.0 "Enclosure". It is durable and disapates heat better that plastic.
 This hard-drive was purchased to be an external hard-drive for my PlayStation 4. I threw it into an enclosure kit &amp; installation was simple from there. It has plenty of storage for what I need &amp; has performed satisfactory. For the price, level of performance &amp; amount of storage, I would recommend this hard-drive.
 These days hard drives are a commodity. I've had this drive in my Mac tower for about 3 months and, so far, it is terrific: fast, glitch-free, and gigantic. But that is what we expect from a hard drive today.
 Garbage,<br/> Was either a mislabeled drive or defective seeing as how it only showed as 1677.90GB with no other partitions present.<br/>Sent it back &amp; got a replacement that was no different. It also was only 1677.90GB with no other partitions present so sent it back as well &amp; will not be trying a 3rd.
 No Box, a plastic bag only. The item is fine...so far it is working but I won’t hold my breath considering the beating it probably took during transport. Oh commons guys. It’s a hard drive,  not a candy. Are you folks really that lazy or just want to save ton of money for the paper box. I would really like to know...Thanks
 Unfortunately, I didn’t have a chance to install these hard drives until after the return time had elapsed. One of them was defective out of the box. I have been using Seagate drives almost exclusively for years with no problems. The law of averages has caught up with me. I’m out $100 and am now wary of Seagate’s quality control. Best I can say is buyer beware.
 The drive being thinner than my other 4TB drives had me concerned that it would not insert properly into my Drobo 5D3 but it installed without issue.  As soon as I inserted it, it interfaced with the Drobo and began the balancing process.  We shall see how well the drive functions as time goes on.
 I bought these to put into a RAID mirror configuration. Less than a week in, one drive fails followed in short order by the second. I'm still trying to recover the lost data, which isn't much, but it still seems to speak to how unreliable these disks are. I would not recommend these disks to anyone for any purpose. Buy something else.
 Successfully installed this Seagate 2TB BarraCuda SATA 6Gb/s drive in USB case and used as external drive for Dish Hopper w/Sling (2nd version).
 With all of the reviews talking about getting drives with no warranty that had been pulled from external enclosures and sold as new I wanted to post a positive from my experience.  The 3 - 6TB Barracuda Pro drives we received all have a full 5yr warranty on them according to Seagate.
 I got this drive for its storage size. I was quite impressed that it was basically plug and play. No installation issues and transfered all my data. Still have about 4 terabytes left. Sometimes you can hear it audibly click on but other than that it works great as a storage drive.
 So far so good. I'm using the drives in a Synology NAS unit in a RAID 1 configuration.<br/><br/>Verified, before opening, the drives ordered and drives received were ST3000DM008.<br/><br/>Of note, these drives were produced in Thailand, March 2018.
 Would only format to 1.8TB with Mac and Windows. Could not format to 4TB Sticker says 4TB, Serial number is for 4TB drive Seagate Tech support told me the drive is only a 2TB HDD. Did not realize until return period ended so sending it back to Seagate so they can exchange the drive for one that is 4TB. Not amazon fault drive was not labeled correctly. Maybe someone bought a 2TB and got 4TB who knows.
 This is my third Seagate BarraCuda Internal Hard Drive 1TB SATA drive, they just keep on keeping on.
 The fact that this particular variant INCLUDES DATA RECOVERY is a MAJOR PLUS. Make sure this is the one you buy. It's a tiny bit more expensive but if something happens it's far better protection in a major failure situation.
 I believe I use it for my ps4. Works great. No problems at all. Just make sure u go onto the PlayStation site and have a USB stick handy. I believe u need to either transfer all ur saved data or back up your data using PlayStation plus. Plus was the way to go. A lot easier.
 It was a decent hard-drive when it worked. Slow, but big and cheap. Didn't have any specific issues until it just completely failed out of nowhere. I expected a storage drive like this to potentially fail after 3-4 years, but this is far too soon.<br/><br/>Contacting SeaGate for support to see if it's under warranty, will update as things progress. I've bought SeaGate products before and never had an issue, so hopefully this is just a fluke.
 Was looking for extra space in my gaming pc. so I bought this. I highly recommend this product. Other reviews say the drive is a bit loud, but I tend to disagree. After installing it, and formatted the drive, I barely noticed any difference in sound in my computer, and my computer is almost completely silent. The only problem I have is that the metal casing on the top had a small dent in it upon arrival, but I wouldn't think anybody else will have this problem.
 WOW, all we can say is WOW 32Gb of ram with 4ghz I7 and 2 Great 500Gb hard drives striped 0 raid maiking 1TB and talk about fast!!!
 No problems with the purchase of this HDD. Classic hard drive and it's been a year since I've bought it. Seagate is a great company to buy from. Don't blame the company for the error. All HDD's will die eventually after 4-5 years. This will be sticking around until it breaks. It was very cheap too for a HDD
 Exactly what you would expect from a reputable company like Seagate. I use this particular hard drive in my surveillance system at my home, and it works great. Excellent price too by the way
 For the Money, hands down the best value on AMAZON as of Feb 2018. This drive works like a champ and provides quick access time for my media. It isn't the largest HDD or the fastest HDD but for the money it is right in that sweet spot.
 2 TB for a external hard drive my son will use for his recording and mastering those recordings.  He is into music pretty big time, making it, recording it and mastering it.  Doing great!  Going to graduate from the MIRA program pretty soon.  I am proud of him and glad we could get this replacement drive for him!  I would recommend this for anyone to back up their computers!
 Good buy, works as stated or at least to be expected from a hard drive. Has as much space as depicted, still running strong.
 Not as fast - NOT even close to previous gen's of BarraCuda - use to mean something - oh ya - FAST - this one was a meh - helped overall - but very slightly ....
 my 5 year old home made desktop computer had a 1 TB hard drive. I wanted to replace that drive for future reliability purposes and what a treat to do just that and add another TB of storage space. I used Acronis true image to clone the old drive and re-proportion the partitions. I am happy with the price and quality of this drive.
 Worked for six days, then won't boot, unrecognized disc, no response. Recovered what I could using Recuva. Tried re-format, other computers, other disc tools - no good. Went with Seagate because of recurring problems with WD - now, forget Seagate. And over two weeks since mailed back, no refund yet.
 Just purchased the 6TB drive for photographic and cinematic files.  Each year's worth of data now in the TB range.  This one is fast and super quiet.  Seagate still makes great drives.  The rule is simple.  You never ever have too much memory, speed or storage.
 This is the ONLY hard drive I buy, I have 3 in my server, 3 in my PC and 2 in my dads PC. These are seriously the best hard drive I have ever used. They are very vast, reliable and last  forever. I have had no issues at all!
 This drive runs so silently that I thought it was not working until I put my hand on it and could just make out the heads stepping. It also ran amazingly cool while writing a large number of files (250GB) to the device.
 So far so good. It is running in my RAID1 system paired with a similar Seagate drive. Win 7, using software mirroring by Windows. Setup was easy.  Mobo offered RAID, too but I didn’t like the messages it was sending from Intel controller
 I cannot comment on durability - it remains to be seen. That HDD functions find and works as expected. I didn't measure its performance and cannot confirm or otherwise stated in its specs. Also, it is a secondary drive in my system (the primary is SSD). The installation went according to a manual which came with computer case. There was no unexpected problems.
 This drive is good to store documents. That's it. If you are a gamer and want to make this a gaming drive for any large games forget it. Example. If you put overwatch on this drive, and you try to connect to matches, you will be disconnected due to inactivity in the game because your game is loading so long. People join the game, pick characters and start while you are still loading a single map. One example. Dont buy for games. Nice drive though. I will be upgrading to a WD black.
 Lots and lots of storage for programs. This is not an SSD so don't expect lighting loading speeds. It does what it is supposed to do, hold all your files and that's about it. Cheap as well for what you get.
 Order fulfilled by Amazon, arrived quickly with no problems with initial install. installed in a Corsair 570x with anti vibration pads also installed. PC hasn't moved since the new drive was installed. I used this drive primarily as Steam drive, it had about 600gb of data on it that was accessed quite frequently. I first started noticing problems about 3 months in. initially swapping out SATA data and power connection seemed to fix the problem. the drive has unmounted itself and shows an available 396mb in the drive manager.
 MOD 5/2018 fresh baby out of the box ! Ready to rock your world for all your storage needs !
 Failed for no reason right at the one year mark. I was lucky enough to back everything up on a cloud storage but I had to buy a new hard drive (from a different manufacturer) and Windows 10 again. Don't buy this hard drive. It's not very durable.
 Recent purchases come out of the box with two partitions. I have had three this way. I suspect they are used or made for a specific purpose and resold but I don't know for sure.  They still work fine but you do need to re-partition them.
 It stores all the data I need and it is quiet. It is fine for a storage drive but I wouldn’t use anything other than a solid state drive for my C drive. I just can’t justify a $350 SSD for storage.
 Total security is a clone of my laptop drive stored in my bomb shelter in a fireproof safe!  Acronis can see this drive and put a clone on it.  Easy to replace a computer, not so easy to rebuild all your installs and replace your data.
 Can anyone help me on this I have formatted it and moved it to different ports I have a 250gb ssd which works perfectly fine, but this drive only shows up in device manager but cant be used form more than 100gb out of the full terabyte of memory.
 I love this HDD for gaming. It write/read speeds are really quick. Not up to the standards of an SSD but sure close. I put my favorite games on my SSD and all my other games on this drive. Great for Mass Storage for Gaming purposes. If you use this as a boot drive for your computer, it boots up quick only probably a second or two longer than my SSD. TBH I don't notice much of a difference. The last con is the HDD is really loud. I wanted a very quiet PC which I achieved for my current PC until I installed this.
 I bought this hardrive used like new from amazon warehouse. I ran the serial number and the warranty is good until April 2019 for the drive. Its still in great condition. Im very happy with my purchase and look forward to getting another one.
 I have been running the drives 24/7 since I received them and they are still going. What else can I ask for? I have not done any of that hardcore benchmarking tests that others might have done but it is working for me. I have multi-connections to the server and no complaints. I will buy again.
 Using this drive as a backup location.  We have not had any issues with regards to speed/data integrity.  Would buy again for sure!
 Nice quiet replacement upgrade drive that allowed me to double my storage space.<br/>Only 4 stars cause I couldn't get the software to work to clone my old hard drive.<br/>Ended up using Windows Dism to create a WIM image of my old hard drive then applying that to the new drive.
 Works fine. I'll never understand why these internal drives are so much more expensive than external enclosures though.
 I build and repair systems so I know how to partition a drive. This drive had 2 partitions. 1 2gb the other almost 1 gb<br/>The second partition was unusable and couldn't be accessed no matter what I did.<br/>sent back for refund
 Great so far. This hard drive has worked well for the three weeks it's been installed in a new computer. It replaced an ancient Samsung spinpoint hard drive (from 2010!) and the Seagate is much quieter. Will update this review if it dies before it should.
 I have bought several of these drives over the last year to repair and to upgrade several computers of mine and I have to say that you just can't go wrong with these drives. I've used other manufacturers before and they don't hold up like seagate does. Great products and a great value!
 Works great. Casual gaming and streaming at home...3stars for lasting only 1yr.
 VERY NOISY!!!<br/>This hard disc is fast and big, but it is extremely noisy!! I will definitely return it and ask for a refund. I am very disappointed about the product.<br/>The price should be reconsidered considering the NOISE that this thing makes. The only option for me to continue using it would be to move my computer in a different room and keep the monitor, keyboard and mouse in here. It is ridiculous!!!
 Failed within two months.  Amazon return period expires after 30 days.
 2 weeks in and drive began showing errors and warnings of failure
 I'm so disappointed by this hard drive. I knew Barracuda for being a good and reliable brand, but I used this hard drive for less than 2 months and it stop working. I hope that it's just a defective product and that someone maybe it can be talk with the seller or the company, but I paid a fair price for a quality product wich I clearly didn't receive. (My experience with this product )
 Worked great and it was easy to install. Only took like 5 seconds. I did not know but windows 10 will automatically load to your new hard drive if you have previously registered the device with your account and load it with the ISO file, so it was really easy to install windows again.
 Working flawlessly
 Ordered on friday, arrived nextday.  Great job.<br/>What can I say about the HDD....  it holds a lot of data, close to 4 tb, but not all the way.....
 works great.  Plugged it and it worked without problem.  Windows 10 installed on the 3 TB drive. Windows used to be limited to a maximum of booting from a 2TB drive or less.
 Holding all my gaming, video, and audio files crammed in here instead of clogging my main working hard drive.  Very pleased so far, Recommended.
 I had one of these fail after about 6 months, and another after about a year and a half. Just spend the extra money for HGST.
 Excellent replacement of my Seagate hard drive that went out after 3 years in my Alienware PC. Runs super quiet and speed now back up to what it was when I purchased the PC. Price was about a 1/3 of what Dell wanted to sell me for a replacement.
 Install was easy, I use it in a docking bay, just slide it in and go... I purchased this drive to hold my music collection. Makes it easy to just pull it out and take it anywhere I need to go. I'm probably going to be buying more in the near future.
 Pairs well with an SSD boot drive as a disk for raw storage. It's relatively quiet for an HDD but still the loudest component in my system. If quiet is your goal, I'd stick with only one of these, so get as much capacity as you can afford, rather than attempting to add additional drives later.
 Seagate's specs are a tad confusing and Amazon does not help.  The basic Barracuda 8 TB drive is only a 5600 drive not a 7200 as the site claims.  The Pro (which seems to have the same model number) is a 7200.<br/><br/>I ONLY buy seagate and will use other similar drives for offsite storage, but I cannot use them in a RAID array
 Purchased this for a camera set and only got about 7 months out of it.  It would shut my system down after recording for a while. I would not recommend this hard drive if your looking for long time use.
 I didn't realize it was only 5400rpm until after installation. Oh well, good enough for backup.
 Stores my 1.7 TB "Homework" Folder with no problem
 Simple data hard drive nothing fancy had to replace a dying maxtor 250 GB drive that I killed when I left my computer in storage and the PC got knocked over  my main PC has a nvme m.2 so I'm a bit spoiled but as far as spinning drives go not a bad product would buy this for a casual gamer or user
 Seller ANYHDD is removing the drives from external enclosures and packaging them as "new."  The drive was manufactured in Oct, 2018, but checking the serial number on Seagate's warranty lookup, I get the following:<br/><br/>"The product you identified was sold as a system component."  Therefore I cannot get warranty coverage for it.<br/><br/>Checking the SMART stats, the raw read error rate was 67%, which should've been 100% being brand new.  Its work time was a random, large number, which indicates the SMART chip is going bad.
 This is an awesome hard drive, i utilize this drive as a secondary drive to to store all my programs and other media on on my gaming PC. has a read and write speed of 200 mbs, which is fast enough form me to run my online games that i play, such as EVE and Star Wars; The Old Republic. have not utilized this for an offline game yet  but will give an update when i do.
 Works great for the XBox One!  Paired with an enclosure and son is off to the races!
 I attached the benchmarks I got for this drive. I am pretty happy with this purchase, although shipping did take forever. I see some reviews about faulty drives failing after a year or so. Will update if it fails.<br/><br/>No screws or cables came with the product, had to get my own.
 Seemed like a good drive and good brand, but it started acting up 1 month before the warranty is expiring.  Its not fully dead yet, I can read from it but writing is really really slow.  Replacing it with a WD.
 Not much to say, it's a hard drive and it works.  My old 640 GB drive finally ran out of space.<br/><br/>I had considered spending another $30 on the Firecuda hybrid SSHD, but decided I would probably never notice the difference.
 I got these from an open box deal and they work great. They were in a different box but the drives were still sealed in the original plastic and were not physically damaged at all. They are super silent and fast! I purchased 2 of the 2 TB versions for storage drives.
 Got it in November, worked fine and now after a few months it is crap. Constant beeping and my computer only reads it half the time. Wish I could return it but it's past the return time window.
 I am a video editor, I have a lot more hard drives than you, I suspect. I always buy Seagate Barracuda because they never fail. I have not lost a single bit to a drive crash. Oh, crap, I just jinxed myself. Never mind.
 Works like a HDD should, good price for TB and Seagate is one of my favorite computer part brand.
 Yup, went from 512MB to 2TB, and boy do I regret not doing this sooner...
 Didn't work out of the box. Was bought for one that lasted about a year in a NAS. Time to drop Seagate as a preferred HD manufacturer.
 This hard drive was a direct, plug-in replacement for the drive I had that went bad.  And so far it's working great.
 Bought two of these to replace an old 640GB Raid1 setup.  Worked on my controller with no issues and are pretty fast (~180MB/sec) mirrored.<br/><br/>They are bare disk and don't come with any mounting hardware and use standard sata connectors.<br/><br/>ezpz
 Used this for an iMac replacement.  Had to be a little thinner and this one fit great.  I am usually a Windows or Linux user\technician, but this one worked fine in the process of rebuilding the MacOS.
 This drive is fairly fast for an HDD. It's been holding up well so far. If you've been facing long loading time for file sorting in Windows Explorer in Windows 10, right-click the affected folder &gt; Customize tab &gt; Optimize this folder for: General Items.
 Solid reliable product from Seagate - the standard of hard drives. I always trust in their drives.
 Loved the size and price. I am using it for my linux system and will be getting a couple more for my security systems.
 Luckily, it was in my NAS, so I had a second copy, but a hard drive shouldn't be failing after only 8 months of light use when I've got external drives from 15 years ago that still work.
 Great hard drive at a great price, I get excellent speeds and it was easy to install and format.<br/>I would recommend this over the WD Blue<br/><br/>Will update with longevity in the future
 These saved me on my other 2 6TB failed drives.  may not go abouve 4TB in my Drobo server.
 Hard drive installation was made easy by downloading software from Dell website, specifically for XPS 8900 with Windows 10.  I simply gave Dell my serial number and was able to download the re-installation software and drivers.
 I bought 12 of these for use in my home NAS. I'll admit that 12 was overkill. They were packaged well. In terms of it being 5400 RPM, it was useful in my setup to keep the heat down. I definitely recommend it if you just need storage.
 1 of the 3 drives I ordered failed after 12 hours. The other two drives seem fine. Replacement is on it's way.
 I wanted a massive drive for storage of my games and movies and music I had accumulated through out the years for a new build.  This drive fit the bill and works tremendously.  It is very fast, huge and pretty quiet.  If I need another one of this size down the road I would not hesitate to get another one.
 It broke within 4 months of purchasing, and I had to pay for return shipping. Seagate sent me a new one that's been working for the past 2 months, and I'll update if that one breaks too. Maybe look for a different manufacturer though if you're looking for a new HDD
 Never had a Seagate drive fail on me ever. I knew I was going to get an awesome deal on the Two TB drives, so I went and got two. I run these in a RAID 1 setup, and let me tell you. They are fast! Really quiet even in a liquid cooled computer.
 Works great in my son's PS4 (via a piggy-back addon that allows full 3.5" drives to be used). It has not been in use for long enough to rate on longevity, etc. It's 6 times larger than the 500Gb 5400 RPM drive that came in the PS4 so storage space is no longer an issue.
 Its fast, but not faster than an SSD, it's really good for mass storage, and storing gaming that arent fast paced FPS. Well worth the price. Games are getting to big to have just one harddrive, glad I picked this up.
 perfect for storing all my games, however the dislike i have is when resuming my pc from sleep mode, the drive isn't there anymore, i always have to restart windows for it to recognize it.  Other than that, it works fine.
 Purchased this for my daughter's build. Completed the build, I've done tons of builds never once had an issue, and continually getting boot errors and windows freeze. I've done new full install of Windows and have the same issue. First time having an issue with Seagate drives but highly disappointed especially since I couldn't get around to the build and discover the issue until after the 30 day return policy expired. Guess I'll be shopping around for a replacement...
 I ordered the 4tb hdd. It works as advertised and I had no problems with installation. Great upgrade for my system and I highly recommend. Awesome price for the storage.
 I bought this to add to existing PC for storage. Installation was easy and my PC had spare power and data cable already sitting available.  Formatting was also easy and done through disk management.<br/>Hard drive is almost silent. Very happy with it.
 Now I remember why I haven't bought a Seagate drive in 15 years. It died within a month.<br/><br/>Pros: Drive died within Amazon's return period.<br/>Cons: Drive is garbage.
 Grabbed these on a Black Friday deal, and they have been reliable so far.  Have had them running 24 hours in external HDD enclosures and internally and they have not let me down.
 Replaced a WD 4tb that died within a year. Actually replace 2. Both WDs had issues inside a year. I have Ironwolfs in my NAS. Segate is the way to go. Now it's nowhere near long enough for a proper review but my Ironwolfs have been under heavy use and are still going strong.
 I am very happy with my 4 TB drive. I am storing all of my movies, TV shows, family photos, my music plus PLEX additions. My PLEX server runs perfectly with all of these files.
 just has slight hum but bearable.  works as expected.  seagate has been a tested product for me.
 This hard drive is making strange clicking noises and has caused my desktop computer to close down multiple times.
 I have 16 of these in a home server that runs plex for my friends and family across the country. Have no failures yet and the average age of the drive is 11 months now and they run 24/7. Ordered a spare today in fact. Just in case.
 replaced the same model as just died, hopefully this one lasts longer than 13 months. I have had the same model name before without issue.
 Product was not delivered as advertised, shown as a 7200 rpm drive but only a 5400 rpm drive was delivered to me. Not the same in performance by any measure. This is the SECOND time that this has happened, one month apart. Amazon needs to step in and fix this problem ASAP.
 This hard drive was used to replace a WD Blue that was on it's last leg at only two years old. My mom's friend was at risk of losing her data. This hard drive worked perfectly and is very fast. Windows installed in 7 minutes! The PC is much faster while my mom's friend's is surprised at the speed.
 Can't express my gratitude on getting a quality drive for a very decent price !<br/>50$ even for a 2TB hard drive with only 100+ hours of use when i got it.
 Barracuda one of the best conventional hard disks!
 Item was shipped on time and came exactly as expected. packaged cleanly and safely. The only issue I had was the lack of any hard drive screws included. In the past I've bought hard drives, and they have come with hard drive screws. This did not. Not a deal breaker by any means, butt be aware that you will have to purchase those separately. fortunately, they're very cheap.
 Put this hard drive into a Drobo 5D and it died in under 24 hours. Don't buy this unit if you actually need to have it work for more than 24 hours.
 I use this for my current steam libary in my built pc. Works like a charm just wish these things were faster. waiting for my games to load takes a minute but that might be because my system is due for an upgrade. Currently running in a core i5 4570 with 8 gigs ram and GTX 1050.
 Headlines says it all.  Under warranty, I'll update with how that goes, but not excited about a drive that lives just long enough to go past the Amazon return period.  Luckily it's in a four-drive NAS as part of a RAID, so nothing lost.
 Perfect for what I wanted
 I know these are budget drives, but I didn't expect them to go this far downhill after two years. I bought two, one routinely corrupts files, and the other is at about 30% of the speed it was on day 1.
 Lots of storage for photographic projects at relatively inexpensive cost.  Quiet.  Installed in Vantech metal enclosure for heat dissipation.  Durability still to be determined.
 This drive is great. Just plug in power from your computers power supply and connect it to your motherboard via sata cable and you're good to go! You have about 1.81Tb after formatting this drive to work on your computer!
 Super fast drive. I have had this for about 5 months. So far, so good. Super fast for a platter drive. Good for gaming.
 My Dell had a 2tb version of this that just stopped working o e day. With a few basic tools and a YouTube video I wayched, I replaced it with one. Easy as can be. Now It works better than ever. Highly reccomended. And back up everything.
 Worked right out of the well packaged box and set up was easy. I didn't test transfer speed but it does what I need it to do. If I have any problems I will update this review.
 My Netgear ReadyNAS server is relatively old and called for the Seagate ST2000DM001 drive. However, these are in short supply and expensive. Seagate support said the ST2000DM006 is a seamless upgrade, so I gave it a shot, and it worked fine in my server.
 The previous model lasted me a good 4.5 years each minimum. After over 5 years I have replaced 3 out of 4 and have the 4th on standby. Fluently in a raid 5 config and perform up to expectations.
 This drive is incorrectly described.  It is 5400 RPM, as verified with CrystalDiskInfo 7.8.3.  I'm very annoyed.  Otherwise it's fine.  Just not what I paid for.
 Doing a disc update on my computer and I bought two of these drives. First one was OK, installed and accepted a transfer of about 1.5 Tb from former drive (took HOURS). Second drive installed OK and appeared to work, but would not accept Fast Mirror backup of first drive via BACKUP4ALL. Every attempt failed from 2% to 85% completion. Seems like the drive was not staying in communication with the first drive. Took out the new drive and installed a spare to retry (a portion) of the transfer. Ran a Fast Mirror that ran for 2+ hours, no problem.<br/>Contacted Amazon and got an instant replacement ordered. Printed the RMA and sent off the old drive. New drive shipped on faith (after I signed that I would return the bad one, fair enough) and is due in two days.<br/>Possible problem: drives were combined with an order of newspaper cover sheets resulting in their being at the "bottom" (when held vertically) of a large box.  This, plus the choice of shipper UPS, (FedEx is safer for drive shipment) may have caused the damage.
 Iv bought a few of these now for my builds .best price on the internet by far and gets the job done! One of these babies and you shouldn't need another hardrive thanks so much!
 I had my hard drive go out on the day you did this deals of the day and it was an awesome deal for a BarraCuda, had only used these at work in my IT jobs and found them to be quite efficient.  This was quick and easy to swap out with no major setups.  You guys rocked on the price and the speed of delivery, while becoming a life saver for me.  Thanks.
 I was skeptical about getting such a large hard drive but for the price I couldn't turn it down!  I ran speed tests and the product I received outperforms pcs that had similar builds to mine.  Easy installation and absolutely love the pc space I have now.
 I wrote in the past that this drive failed me, but it was the PSU dying, so, im correcting my drive and saying that is working as intended 6 months and going strong.<br/>OLD REVIEW----&gt;Sadly this drive lasted me less than 4 months, i would not recommend to anyone to gamble.
 After swearing off Seagate many years ago, I decided to give them another try. Received my new ST4000DM004 4TB today and checked the serial number on Seagate web site. Guess what? Serial number is valid but warranty expires in 25 months. There is supposed to be a 3 year warranty. So beware... I'm not sure when the start date is based off of but getting two thirds of the warranty is nothing short of a scam. I'll keep this drive as I don't want to go through the hassle waiting for a return. But this will be my last Seagate product. Now lets hope it works.
 It’s a great drive. My second one.
 So far, so good.  I installed Windows 7 on it and copied data from my hard drive that seems to be dying.  Everything went quickly and well.  Only time will tell how long it will last - hopefully many years into the future.
 I have a mixture of Seagate and WD hard drives and don't have any issues with this one at all. Great for storing music and pictures in external USB adapter. Also got it at a great price.
 This drive is a 5400 rpm drive. The Amazon site states that it is 7200 rpm. The Seagate specs say it is 5400 rpm. It is also quite slow compared to similar drives using the Crystal test. The drive I received showed multiple bad blocks under a surface test.  I have returned it.
 Very good purchase. This drive's high rpm allows for streaming HD movies without glitch or buffering. I am well pleased with this purchase and trying to justify buying another. This drive by Seagate is highly recommended.
 It’s a hard drive folks....It’s 2TB and you plug a a few wires into it! Bam! Hard to be a lackluster product when it’s so simple
 Packaged - neatly. Speed - as advertised. Have been using it extensively for months now, no problems at all.
 Two identical drives working in a RAID array, excellent hardware
 Needed more space to save movies, this fit the need.
 My Mac Pro has three internal hard drives. I've had Seagate drives for years. They always work perfectly. I buy a new one every year for Time Machine backups.
 Not only is it quick and quiet but for the price, you get a good amount of storage space.
 I get 60-80 MB/s transfer rates in real world use. Don't expect any more than that. Yes, it uses the SATA 6Gb/s data port, but the drive won't write that fast. It took 7.5 hours to put 2TB of data on it (74MB/s average).
 This piece of crap would only show 801g on Mac, yet would format NTFS in Windows. Went round and round with Apple care, Apple store and two different operating systems on different machines with no luck dragging this out past the return period.<br/>Always been a Seagate fan, but based on this experience and the reviews and comments I am DONE.
 This drive has been holding up for over a year without any problems. The only thing I wish I did now was buy two, because I'm getting close to filling this one up.
 No issues since putting it in. just didnt come with the wires so I used the ones from my cd drive. It works great just wish I would have went for a bigger TB, Its almost full already.
 Good price, lots of storage, works like a champ so far.  I've had it in my system for a few months, so far, so good.  It's plenty fast for a non-SSD drive, and provides me with a lot of storage for my PC.
 Using it as a game drive. I have installed all the games I want and still have about 1tb+ of storage left. Might use some of it for videos as well.
 Tons of storage, fast, and no issues with compatibility.
 I bought two of these for my data backup needs. Obviously not as fast as SSD's, but they do have a great deal more capacity. But, so far so good...they're working great at a fraction of the cost.
 excellent storage drive, this would be 5 stars but i could hear the the drive spinning after it went to sleep (just for like 2 to 3 seconds) i have had other drives in the past and none of those did or barely made any noise.
 arrived on time but wasn't what I wanted so I returned it
 Excellent Drive!
 Fast and quiet, got two of these for my nas and no issues so far at all.
 Drive Failed in less than 2 months.  Installed mid July 2018, started getting errors Late August.  I tried formatting, ran SeaTools diagnostics, drive Failed 10% into test.  Ran the fix tool in SeaTools, it also failed.  So now I have to pay to ship it to SeaGate.
 Cheap 2 terabyte hard drive that works.
 So far its great. I love the space, and the load times from games are not bad at all. Its not like an ssd of course, but still loads pretty fast. Overall would recommend getting this if you need storage space for anything like playing games, video editing, etc.
 Wanted an SSD for my OS drive. Already have a 1 TB spinning drive for data. But could not turn this down at the price. Easy to install and boot, works fine, no problem. Only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I want to see it run for about 10 years first.
 Set this drive up for TV recordings on our media server. Copied over all existing recordings to it and have been sending new recordings to it without issue for a few weeks so far. Great little drive with a large amount of storage, so far.
 Oh Seagate, how I love your HDD's. This thing is a great solid HDD.
 It works out of box, plug and install windows and runs smoothly and notably faster than my last 7200rpm drive, also from Seagate. I was concerned I wouldn't be content without either a SSHD or just balls to the wall SSD, but this is just as fast as I need it to be. Will I upgrade to an SSD? Yes, of course. But it's not a priority with this quality drive.<br/>I give 4 stars because the branding and design are confusing, I actually thought I WAS buying the SSHD version of this, and while I'm still satisfied without, it was slightly disappointing.
 So far so good. I had a Seagate 5T portable HD. I believe it shorted out between the outside plug and the HD connectors inside the box. In any case, I lost everything. I got the 6T internal hard drive, hoping it will remove the possibility of that kind of short and based on improvements I read while researching the drive. Hopefully it will perform as expected.
 Ended up get an ST2000DMB06 instead of the ST2000DM006. So far it works and is fairly quiet. Had a small problem involving not seeing it under devices, but i got it to work. Will update if anything bad happens.
 It does its job, but damn, its loud. I actually had to wedge something next to it to cut down on the vibration. This HDD is louder than my entire machine. This is definitely partly due to my case but still...
 Quiet when running.
 Continuously have issues with this drive going offline and then requiring scanning on reboot. I have followed every conceivable tip in regards to power saving settings, etc. Would NOT buy again.
 Works well - Larger than most 2TB drives by a bunch of sectors. If you are going to use this to replace a mirrored drive you will need to reduce the partition size in your device manager.
 No issues, solid drive and worth the purchase. too soon to tell how long it will last, but it installed with no issues and is storing data. access time's are respectable for a non-ssd drive
 It didn't die in a year. 10/10
 this drive is great for the price and is on level for performance<br/>only issue I had was it was shipped in just a bubble wrap envelope.
 During registration this item<br/>Seagate show me the 2 years warrenty not 5 years.<br/>Another one is inconvenience!<br/>6 TB cannot be seen full during format.<br/>only 5.48 TB is read.<br/>How can I resolve it?
 This is by far the best deal on Amazon for a 2 TB 3.5 inch 7200 RPM hard drive.  Basically Plug n Play.  You can't go wrong with this unit.
 Product failed while installing programs.
 Doesn't play nice with older BIOS that can't support 3TB as one drive... Partitioned and still lost data, it just decided to lose association with the PC, had to go spend more money on Seagate recovery tools.  It's a mess...  Very disappointed.
 Not happy the way it was delivered in a bubble wrap envelope.  Windows had no problems recognizing this hard drive. Worked right out the envelop.
 If you are buying this hard drive for a security system go bigger. 2 TB only holds a week of video
 After a few months, no issues as of yet. Seagate is known for dying faster than a bottle rocket, but nothing has happened so far. I will update once (I know it will) it does.
 Lots of space pretty decent speed highly recommend. I use it for all my video files especially 4K videos take up a ton of space
 Purchased 12 of these drives on March.  One is bad and Seagate is saying that the warranty expired on 03/01/18.  How is that possible with a drive that was just purchased?
 worked so well, I will be ordering again.
 HD works great. Purchased multiple of these for a server.
 Went on Seagate's website and the 1 year warranty had expired! This drive died within 3 months and Amazon would not support a return or replacement!
 This drive was for an NAS (Network Attached Storage) device. The drive fit into the NAS slot properly and has been working without issue since it was installed. It is quiet and seems reliable and I would buy more of these if I had the need.
 I'm not sure what went wrong here, but I bought 2 of these and they both were faulty. Yes, Amazon took them back. Even Seagate even said that the sound my drives were making was bad and should be returned.
 Dead on Arrival.  I will not purchase Seagate Hard Drives again.
 Bought this eight months ago from Amazon. It replaced the original Seagate in my desktop PC (that lasted 7 years). My PC/this drive is on 24/7 and works great. Very quiet and quick.
 I have used 1TB, 2TB, 3TB and now 4TB  BarraCuda drives.  "ALL" of them are still functioning fine.  These are excellent hard drives.
 Works great for application I needed
 Drive died in 28 days!!!  I had transferred all of my movies from my old back up drive that lasted 10 years to this one. Silly me, assuming the drive would last more than a month! Thanks so much for causing the loss of 100's of movies that took me years to download or convert!!!  The fact that I had personal info on a drive that I had to return will now mean hours of changing ALL of my passwords and user names!  After having read many of the negative feedbacks for this drive, I will never buy another Seagate drive again! Outrageous that this piece of junk is being sold!
 We use these drives a backup archives, 4tb. Had previously been ordering ST4000DM005 which has a smaller cache, and ordered this for that difference. Unfortunately, the form factor is slimmer than a typical drive and it doesn't fit in our hot swap bay without flopping around.
 Holds lots of storage, had it for a year so far and it still works, the only thing that's meh about it is the fact it's a little bit slow when you initially boot but just needs a good warmup and its up to speed.
 All of them arrived working. No issues loading them up with data writes for a few days, no issues of any kind. Using these in a raid array. Good buy
 After 60 days, the drive bearings started whistling.  After 80 days, it sounds like a smoke-detector alarm.  Seagate does not have replacements in stock, so getting a replacement could take weeks.
 Don't work with either of my clients computers<br/>Product support is non existent at Seagate.<br/><br/>I am going to return the driver's to the seller.
 Just got it out of box and it won’t boot up. I’ve tried accessing it thru disk management and cmd prompt and nothing. It simply won’t turn on. No vibration, no sound NOTHING!
 I have had this hard drive for 3-4 months now and I really have a hard time finding something to complain about. I got exactly what was listed and it performs how I expected a 7200rpm hard drive to perform. I could nitpick and complain that it's not as fast as an SSD, but it was never advertised to nor did I expect it to. This is a great hard drive for storing a lot games on, my primary drive is an SSD and I have no complaints about the performance and speed of this drive. It's honestly not the fastest, but surely not the slowest 7200rpm hard drive I have used. I have yet to have any issues with and I do hope that it will hold up to the test of time. If you are looking for a lot of space at an affordable price you can't really go wrong with this hard drive.
 This hard drive is really good I purchased the 1 TB model and it's really fast at 7200 RPM. It beats my old 1 TB hard drive which was 5400 RPM but my only concern is that it's a little bit loud you could barely hear it and I could hear it louder than my case fans but it's still really good and I love it. I would recommend.
 just got this and now March 18th the drive crashed should have sent it back from the start it was very noisy out to the box
 I actually ended up buying 2 of these drives at different times in the same month from different batches and they both died within 4 months.
 It was defective unit.
 Should have paid the extra cost for the IronWolf Pro with Vibration Rotation control when used in a RAID. When there are multiple drives in the same enclosure, they can create some funky vibrations that work against each other.
 Seagate 1TB Barracuda So far has been working and no clicking and great value. Update 4/2/18 The Hard Drive still going strong no issues or failed working great in my desktop computer windows 10. 5 stars Update after 1 year is coming soon
 Purchased these for a two bay QNAP NAS Drive, which I use for my small business. All the data stored on the drives are Word Docs and PDf’s. Previously I had regular desktop drives installed and they caused the fans in the NAS to spi constantly. These new drives are just as fast, but are much quieter. I never hear them nor the fans spin up. After about a year they are excellent and when I need to upgrade to large drives I will use ironwolfs
 I bought this HDD for my iMac late 2009 and it works fast and flawlessly. My original Seagate HDD was started to mulfunction after 7 years. I have no issues with the HDD temp sensor, just remember to plug the connector as it was before. Also, I was surprised by the HDD speeds, 30% faster than the previous HDD. I hope that it will last as the previous one :)
 Thought this was a solid state, I'm an idiot. I do use it in tandem with my 128gb solid state now though. It's fantastic for storage, not loud AT ALL.<br/><br/>I got a refurbished one and I haven't had a single issue with it.
 The hard drive is damaged.
 I was unsure when buying since many reviews said it was noisey, but others insisted it wasn't...yepp, its chattery.  I placed rubber bumpers between the mounts and drive, which helped a bit.
 It seems to be a great drive.  Works like I expect.  I am now starting to hear the drive spinning.  Not overly keen on that.  I'll have to keep an eye on it.  I'd hate to think the bearings were starting to fail after only a couple of months.
 Works great, easy install.
 Fast internal drive! I use this with an external hard drive USB 3 hub. Great to have cheap, fast, and big storage. Have had for a month or two, no problems.
 Works well!
 2 different drives from 2 different vendors. each failed w/in a week of usage. Won't be using Seagate for a while.
 I've had this HDD for probably a year now and had no issues with it so far! No crashes, etc. The setup within the system was easy. Upon buying this drive for around less than one hundred (if I can remember the price I bought it for) I was expecting it to be defective or just die out within a couple months of usage. I was wrong. I will certainly keep buying their HDD's in the coming months!
 Works as expected. Only time will tell how durable it is.
 Put into my iMac 2008 model. Works perfectly. I formatted it with a FireWire and my MacBook Pro. Don’t know it that was necessary to make it work, but I’m completely happy with it.
 Good price - it works.
 While SSD is the way to go, this unit does have immense storage space and is pretty fast for HDD technology. I use it to archive and it works very well.
 i used this in my camera system it worked great.
 I bought three of these, and they've held up now for more than a year.
 Excellent hard-drive. 2 terabytes.  I installed this in my computer, without any problems. Basically plug and play.
 Exactly as advertised.  I've been running it in my video surveillance server for the weeks since it arrived and it seems to be working just fine.
 Used this to replace a WD black drive that the power connector broke off of, when I was replacing my power supply. I have my OS on an SSD now, so this was perfect for storing my massive steam library on.
 Good product. Works how it’s supposed to. But it didn’t come with any screws to help mount it in a desktop computer. So keep that in consideration when you buy this
 First of all I ordered a 2TB and received a 1TB but I am unaware as to who to contact about this. I also never received the protection plan in my email. It is very easy to install if you know what you’re doing. But overall we are pretty disappointed.
 replaced dead original seagate 1tb on my iMac mid 2010. Drive is thinner then the original. So far so good. Booted from USB and installed ox Sierra.
 I know it's not the fastest drive compared to SSD but for the value and the size (2tb) it's undeniable that it's a great drive to store your games on
 It's a disk. It installed normally and has been working since. Not much more to say.
 So far so good no complaints
 Exactly what I expected. Replaced a 320GB BarraCuda from 8 years ago. I got mine on Black Friday for $80
 This device performed well and was very quite. Unfortunately, It lasted less than 4 months before suffering a complete failure. I was unable to recover any data at all. The drive won't even show that it has a S.M.A.R.T. capability. Now I discover that the warranty period was shockingly short. I'll think twice (or three time) about buying this drive again.
 This thing is not as loud as people make it out to be on youtube videos, don't get intimidated, or peer pressured to get an ssd, only if you really want it!
 Does what it's supposed to!  I bought an SSD for my boot drive and this for my secondary storage.  SSD ended up being corrupted after the first week but no issues with this HDD.
 LOVE LOVE LOVE Seagate Hard drives. Only drives I ever use. Bought this as a back up drive for my new gaming PC build. Installed and running with out a single hiccup. As always. Will never use anything else.
 Works very well. I am using it for gaming and it's all I needed. One of the fastest data transfer speed of all the HDs
 Holy cow this is fast. A lot of drives claim this speed and that speed. This one actually is this fast. I mean this is as fast as some ssd I have owned. With the space to do it well.
 So much space to put all my games.  Still have 1789 GB. This hard drive is overkill
 Purchased May 2018. Failed January 2019.<br/>No longer can write to disk. Can still read from disk. When given a write job, disk usage graph sticks at 100% but avg write speed stays at a constant 0.
 Took a little work to get it installed and able to be read properly by the PC but nothing overly complicated. Works great!
 The drive is a bit price, but with 2 years data and 5 years hardware warranty it is somewhat justified.<br/>I have a six years old ASUS P6T Deluxe MB with SATA II only. It was plugged as a second drive with the boot through a SSD with WIN 7 64bit OS and it was recognized at once. To initialize, as with any new drive, one should go: Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Computer Management / Disk Management. In my case it showed as Disk 01 (disk 0 was the SSD - but it will depend on each port you are plugged and how many drives you have plugged). I chose to create an GPT partition that I didn't know would create an system MBR partition of some 264 Mb to manage the allocation units on the drive, no problem there, but be aware of it.<br/><br/>About the marketing size of drives with more than 2Tb: Because one Byte is 8 bits and one KByte is 1024 bits (not 1000 bits).<br/>Nevertheless, the drive market kinda "steal" from us those 24 bits per Kb, thus when you have advertised a drive as having 6Tb it actually shows on the explorer and alike as having less than that, for the market counts ALL the bits that are there, including those 24 bits per Kb, but the OS (and the all the software that are) consider it not. In fact the drive has six thousand trillion BITS that are less than 6Tb as the unit goes.<br/>Thus with larger drives the difference grows accordingly and It is starting to let some people "mad" about it. I saw one review complaining about the 10Tb having only 9Tb. Perhaps it is time for the manufactures, at least with the larger than 2Tb drives, to star to market is with the actual system Kb and not the total bits.<br/><br/>All and all it is a GREAT drive and I recommend it. Lets hope the price will go down as the new year arrives.
 I needed a larger hard drive for backing up computer hard drives.  This worked perfect with my existing USB 3.0 hard drive dock so I could boot off it and then take a snap shot of the system hard drive.
 My favorite brand and type of hard drive. I have around 15 of them going years back I used them for storage and photo/video editing. These drives are great.
 Purchased it mainly because I have large amounts of games, music, and other media from sources like Steam and Itunes and was running out of space. No noise or instability. Partitioned just fine and is green across the board. Very happy with the purchase.
 Came on time, packaged well. It works as advertised. What more could you want.  I have found Seagate Hard drives. last longer than other brands.
 It works fine so far. For my needs 2TB seems very little, but I had to get this since a G drive which originally came with a 2TB could not handle a bigger hard drive, my Macs could not read more than 1.8TB out of it, so I had to get the same size and it worked right away.
 The drive failed in a record 8 days, Originally it worked like a charm, then it suddenly started hanging up and began freezing mere minutes after start up, crashing my computer.
 A breeze to install. I had my computer cloned and running with this new hard drive in about an hour.  I am a long time fan of Seagate HDs and this one is great.
 Ordered a drive and it arrived dead. NBD, it happens, replacement drive came DOA as well. Please get another drive.
 Great product, works perfectly.
 So far so good, although I didn't realize that this had a "slim" case/size design.  It still was able to fit into my Drobo though.
 Bought this as a gift for my cousin as he had  less than a 1gb HD. He was ecstatic. Easy install if you do it right. Works great! No complaints.
 So far so good.  My old Seagate 2TB drive had 4 bad sectors so I repaired it and cloned it to this drive and all is well.  Let's hope this one remains error free.
 It is a decent drive for everyday storage.  I'm using it in a media storage box, and it (and it's older sisters) perform nicely for this task.  They do not get overly hot, nor do they make much noise.  Overall, I'm pleased with the price and performance.
 Got it for my son , he said it working good and think it's little faster than the black wd 1t it replace
 XOXOXOXOXO
 good price fast shipping
 Used for gaming. Sometimes it can be a bit noisy, but it is still a very good hard drive for the price.
 First hard drive I've ever bought that didn't spin up right out of the box. Had to return and opted for a WD instead...
 Like it. Thanks.
 Purchased exclusively for external backup of large visual effects files<br/>Slid and looked perfectly inside one of my  4 bays external enclosure and is working without problems
 Since it is a mechanical device it will not work well for gaming, One needs a SSD. The unit has never failed. I use 5 to keep data.
 Product was just like any other HDD. Easy to install, works well with no issues. It's basically my secondary drive to my SDD.
 Was dead when it arrived.
 Great drive. Very well built.
 I bought 4 of these drives. 2 completely died within 2 days of being installed. I mean DEAD! The third drive is dying and a different brand is on order. The fourth will just flat out be returned. These are the worst hard drives I have ever bought. 3/4 defective. 4/4 returned! I have sensitive irreplaceable​ information and these drives cannot be trusted.
 great
 As a replacement for a failed drive, I feel fortunate to have found this one. It's quiet and does the job for me.
 Seagate makes one of the best HDD out there
 Drive does what it says.  No problems at all.  I have had good long term experience with Seagate drives.
 Bought this drive on Oct 21, 2018. It died today.<br/><br/>Used on a Mac Pro - performing InDesign edits when the program froze then hard drive disconnected suddenly and is not visible in either disk utility or recovery programs - totally unable to connect or access the drive.<br/><br/>I would very strongly recommend you buy a different hard drive than this one.
 Not sure what the problem was, but had a two day fight to get Win10 to install on this drive.  Now that it is installed it runs quieter and cooler than the 1TB Barracuda that it replaced.
 I did read negative reviews. Made me hesitant to buy, but I did my own research and purchased anyway.<br/><br/>Item was shipped in its own original box, no added protection. Sealed in electronics plastic. No hardware of any sort, nor instructions.<br/><br/>Was able to instal hard drive without any issues. Have a full single partion. So far it is working to my expectations. No complaints yet.
 Good product for the price.
 First one in the mail did not work out of the box. The current one I have now is making a loud buzzing noise whenever I use it. I don't have high hopes that this drive will last long. Do not buy this product, I'm officially done buying Seagate hard drives.
 Installed in a video surveillance system.  So far after 30 days..... no problems.  We will see how things are a year from now
 So far so good, installed this a couple months ago as an additional storage drive and everything is purring like a kitten so far.  I noticed that it seems to be a bit faster than my other spin drive which is a plus.  I'd definitely buy this product again.
 Works great with my ps4 first release console. Added a ton of much needed space. No problems whatsoever.
 How can you fill up 6 terabytes of storage? It isn't hard these days!  Thi drive is excellent for backup storage and holding extra data files that you don't want housed on your main drive. And the company is fantastic to work with.
 Ordered four. One made clicking noises and was slow. Other ones were fine. I returned the faulty one which went easily and the replacement is also fine. Overall good drives but I did get one dud out of four.
 Stores my data and hasn't lost anything yet. Can't fault it for anything other than being slow. That's spinning rust for ya....
 This was a snap to drop into my tower for additional storage space.  Works great with zero issues.
 So far, this hard drive is great. I have 4 other 2TB HDD installed into my tower and just wanted this for some extra games. Fast, formatted out of package. Sadly does not come with side screws or cables but they are cheap enough. Will defiantly buy again.
 Been using this for almost a year. Haven't had any problems, hard drive operates at excellent speed. Would definitely recommend.
 Failed in less than a year.<br/>Still under warranty but "I" have to pay for shipping to Seagate in order to get a refurbished replacement, not a new one.<br/>Stay away.
 Bought this for my son to upgrade his home-built, heavy-duty gaming computer. He says it was easy to install and works great.
 These hard drives are extremely reliable. They do what they're supposed to do, haven't had any issues or slowdowns.
 Used this for my most recent build. Will be buying another one or two in the future
 I was told by Night owl this would not work in the system, but guess what... It did!!! very happy with it!
 installed this in 2007 Imac after the original died. Its like a brand new computer now.
 And don't cost a lot. I use NVME M.2 drives for main and boot, and use the physical drives for long term low usage files.
 I am very impressed with this drive.  256MB cache really seems to make a difference.  I definately recommend this drive.
 this hard drive is stated as a 7200 rpm disk speed drive. It is not! the disk speed of this 8 TB drive is only 5,000 rpm. I was ripped off and this is complete false advertisement!<br/><br/>edit: I bought the 4 TB model not the 8 TB model as stated above.
 great
 easy to install great product
 It was a great choice at the right price when I got it.  Today a bigger disk might be the better price point.  I am perfectly happy with it.
 Unlike my other reviews.  I have no complaints about this hard drive.  It's faster than the stock hdd from my ps4, and even gave me noticeably smoother gameplay. Though the old hdd was REALLY old and abused by leaving it in sleep mode perpetually.  Also,  sleep mode is supported now for this hdd and larger ones.
 Amazon gifted me this after a seller sold me a faulty drive. Install was quick and easy. Im running Windows 10 so I chose the GPT setting even though its 2TB. The OS is installed on my SSD so this is mainly used as storage. It's running quiet and smooth so far, but I'm a little worried about it's lifespan. At the end of the day, I didn't come out of pocket.
 This HDD did not work. Disk Management did detect it, but kept failing to Utilization the Disk so I could Simple Volume it. Kept getting an I/O Error. Tried multiple SATA and Power cables. Kept giving me the error. Faulty HDD.
 I don't know if it is because I'm pro at partitioning my data on the hard drive, but it seems as though everything works very quickly. Overall, the 2tb is a must have if you have a large game library or if you create content for YouTube.
 I'm using this in a Drobo storage solution.  So far so good.  Seems to be working very well.
 DOA got refund from Amazon
 Had to buy another hard drive for more games. Always have bought seagate barracudas and never an issue. High quality and last a long time! Just take care of them.<br/><br/>Packaging was as expected in a box but didn't move at all in package. Excellent.
 I bought this hard drive and used it for 2 month, and then it BROKES! Disk inside is not spinning. Took me 1 month to get a replacement
 So far I am more than happy with this drive. Been going strong for 6 months so far. I should have bought two.
 Value for price is good but the drive would not initiate when installed to my PC, thought it might be the connection so tried on another  slot and still not working. Probably consider paying a little bit more for higher reliability drive.
 I upgraded from an old failing 1tb drive using Seagate's cloning software and couldn't be happier. It's even quieter than the old drive.
 Wasn't 100% sure this would work in my older iMac.  It did but without a correct temperature sensor I had to use an app to control the internal fans or they would spin at 6,000rpm.
 Seagate will not honor the warranty of OEM drives.  Wish I had paid closer attention to the reviews.  Luckily I checked before using them, they are going back.
 1st time using Seagate and it was crap. After successful format, I was able to power on my pc with it only 3 times before it started making the "click of death" noises. Immediate return for refund.
 This drive is suitable for many uses. Anything from movies and music to most games will load quickly off of it, which makes it a good choice for a secondary drive. For a main drive, an SSD is a much better choice, as a computer will boot faster if the OS lives on an SSD. SSDs are also much quieter and consume less energy than HDDs. HDDs are still significantly cheaper per GB/TB than SSDs, which makes them suitable for bulk storage.<br/><br/>To install it, you will need a free 3.5" HDD bay, and connectors for SATA power and SATA data. You could use an adapter to power it with molex, but this is not a good idea. The phrase "molex to SATA, lose all your data" has become a common saying for good reason, as most adapters are poorly made, sometimes melting or even catching fire when they fail, destroying the drive or other components along with it. You will probably not fit this into a laptop, as those usually only have 2.5" drive bays, or the new M.2 sized drives. Refer to your computer's documentation if you arte unsure which size it accepts.<br/><br/>Please note that this drive is not plug and play. You will probably need to format it and assign it a drive letter within your OS before you see it in your file explorer (this is fairly easy in Windows 10, a simple search will tell you how.)<br/><br/>You may have heard that Seagate drives have a high failure rate compared to other brands, which was true for an earlier iteration of the 1.5TB and 3TB BarraCudas. These are a newer model, and do not suffer from the same problem as the older version. That being said, you should always have backups of important files, or anything you can't replace. Network Attached Storage devices, external drives, and cloud services are all good options for backup.
 I needed to put all my files from 3 different computers in one place. This drive did the job.
 Have only run this for about 2 months now, but its running great. Max transfer speeds from a SATA M.2SSD is about 150Mb/s. Plenty fast for the large file transfers I do.
 This drive literally takes 10 seconds to spin up from an off state and will more or less freeze your computer in the meantime. Great drive otherwise.
 ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS with this drive. In fact, I'm so impressed that I bought another.
 So far so good
 Seems to work great so far, super simple to connect, packaged very securely, no problems whatsoever.  Excellent price for a 2TB unit as well
 I'm a WD user but I gave Seagate another try because of the new tech.So don't waste your money because its still just as bad as before.WD is the only way to go for sure.I've got some 8 years old and working great.I've never had a Seagate drive to last very long.I don't know why but WD is still #1 of the Drives.
 Replaced all the drives on my old server but not soon enough as I was transfering the data when replacing drives I lost all the data should have purchased them a year or two ago lol
 Been using it for a while.  Works well.  Arrived in good shape on time.  I used the QNINE 4 Ports PCI SATA Raid Controller Internal Expansion Card with 2 Sata Cables, PCI to SATA Adapter Converter for Desktop PC Support HDD SSD to work in my old WindowsXP machine.  It does well.
 The capacity is very high, and the speeds are as expected. It doesn't make too much noise.
 Runs quiet and extrordinarily well. Its well worth the price. My last Hitachi died fairly quickly under the workload but the BarraCuda has taken it in stride. Good for gaming or just storage. Its obviously not an ssd but it runs smoother than your average HD. Id also reccomend their hybrid drives if your gamer. I wont be buying anything but Seagates from now on.
 Installs easy, very fast for an electro-mechanical drive.  You may need to learn about how to format a GMT drive (over 2gb) and have your OS recognize it.
 Set up went smoothly. Just setting up the drive letter took a few secs to figure out since it was my first time installing an additional drive to a system. Time will tell how this drive holds up.
 The hard drive I received works flawlessly and has been spinning for a few weeks 24/7 with no issues. I've had some of these drives before and if this purchase works out like the others, it will operate for years and years.
 I purchased this hard drive on July 24th and as of September 9th 2017 it has burnt out.
 Excellent
 Love it &amp; would highly recommend it to anyone who's buying a desktop hard drive
 Perfect for my gaming rig. I see people tearing this up in the reviews. Not sure why. Mine works perfect. I only use it to store games.
 Plug and play. Does what I needed it to do.
 I'm using 4 of these in a Synology NAS and although the drives are not server rated they have performed well so far after 4 weeks.
 Replacing an ole 80 gb with two 2GB to mirror. But not TODAY - no cables are included. You need a SATA III cable if you added a new drive to you pooter. Shoot.
 First one either broke after the first initialization or just came broken, but the replacement is working fine. So, keep in mind that you might have to send it back and get a replacement.
 Owned it for about 10 months, works perfectly. Fast and reliable (so far) for a hard drive. Keep your movies, pictures, or/and other less popular (dont often accessed) files, but you should seriously consider (if already not) to buy an ssd for your os and other programs.
 I've been using Seagate hard drives for my builds since I started building my own computers in high school. They are excellent for the price if you are looking for mass storage that's quicker than the slower 5400 RPM drives but not quite as snappy as SSDs.
 Used it for a surveillance camera set. Works fine.
 Using as storage for my new build, very nice and no complaints about it. May pick up another to put into my GF's computer for her storage.
 This is a great HDD...very quiet with fast response time.  I'm using this for video editing.
 Fast and silent , I was expecting it to be noisy and Lugich am surprised , I love it
 worked good
 Installed this myself. Never installed one before. Just looked how the other ones were installed, I have 4 hard drives, googled how to format the drive, which you must do before you can use it. Very easy. Hard drive is very quiet.
 Quick shipping, and the drives worked out of the box I'll know more about longevity as I use them longer
 Replaced an old 1.5 TB drive that had failed.  This was easy to install and works fine.  Did this three months ago.  No complaints.
 Bought 2 of these for use in a RAID storage array. Easy to install and are working fine.
 The hard drive performed great when I first got it. Everything was running smooth and fast. Then today it just went and died. Not much more to say. I'd recommend getting a more trustworthy brand.
 It spins. I used minitool partition wizard to clone my C drive, and she works just like the old one, just bigger.
 Fifth of these I put in my QNAP.  The others are up to three years old and going strong.
 Works fine, but didn't come with mounting screws (I was fortunate to have some old desktop computers around and the screws that secure the plug-in cards or the slot covers to the chassis at the rear are the same).
 nice
 It's a hard drive, what more do you want? It handled being written to and read from constantly for 5 straight days when I was editing a video project it worked fine.
 Faster than WD blue.<br/>Seagate has a bad rep with reliability but their newer drives seem to be better.
 Lost of storage I have them in raid 0 very fast about 400 mbps transfer speed on my old amd mobo. I may have to buy anti vibration rubber mounts to make them even more silent.
 Still working.
 The Right part at a GOOD price sent FAST! What more can you ask for? It fit perfectly &amp; worked great!
 Bought this because my windows crashed and I didn't want to lose my files on that hdd and needed more space.
 The drive, though used, had only about 6 hours of use on it. Has been working perfectly since I got it. Maybe I was lucky, or maybe these are all basically new.
 perfect fit, installed and programmed, still working well after two months of use. im happy with this purchase, i would recommend this as a replacement for an original  part. great value.
 Bought it for the friend. He likes it. Too early to say if it is durable but what more to it. 3 TB space which is a lot for your file and media and it works.
 Use it for a server that runs 24/7 since 2017 and it has not failed yet.
 Been serving me well for a while now. I currently use it solely for my STEAM library
 I would recommend doing a full format, not a quick format, before using this drive.
 Fast, reliable, very happy with these drives.  Have been using Seagate for over 30 years.  Great product.
 These are great hard drives still going stron in my server after a year!
 I bought 2 and returned both. They vibrate way too much and made my computer unbearably loud. Bought a single 6TB Ironwolf and am much happier
 I was hesitant to get this drive because of the bad reviews, but went with it anyways because of the price. I installed it in my new gaming pc and have not had any issues yet. It did get a bit loud when I ran a heavy stress test on it but returned to silent after the test was over. (You will need to format it yourself however there are step by step easy tutorials on both Google and YouTube.)
 have had this for a few months now and seems to be working well. i use it to store my steam games on
 Its reliable and does all that is advertised. what more could you ask for?
 All 4 that I have purchased work fine in my 64-bit Ubuntu tower.
 Incompatible with XP (service pack 3) install disc refused to install onto it no solution found online. Wierd.
 I bought this for a gaming PC that I built for a friend. It's a secondary drive so it's only intended to run games off of it. He gets 60fps and has never had a drive error. Would buy again
 I am really loving the quality and price of these 4Tb Seagate drives!  So far I've bought 4 of them, and they've all been running flawlessly!
 This drive is not the same thickness as other 3.5 drives and it spins slower.  I put this in a raid array and it slowed the whole array down.  Replaced with a different model seagate and raid began working fine
 Working good.  No issues.  Using to record security camera footage.
 Reasonably fast, peace-of-mind guarantee.  I would recommend the Barracuda Pro series to anyone that has data that they cannot live without.  The caveat?  This is not a replacement for proper backups, and if used for that you had better expect one to two weeks downtime.<br/><br/>Keep it real, people....
 Slower than other 7200 rpm hd. Work well with optane memory in my pc.
 Good drive, works fine. I hope it lasts. Seagate's quality/product life has improved recently, so I am hopeful. This will be used for backup, so hopefully it will last a long time.
 always a good idea having extra storage in a computer.<br/>or if you want to have a dual operating system boot.
 Dead on arrival
 run too hot and get 2% of bad sectors after 3 months of use
 Works great on the Dell Inspiron 530 mini desktop for the 2tb hard drive
 New drive installed and is working perfectly so far in my RAID 1 NAS.
 Hard to get another name brand drive for less $ per GB.  Overall, a great value.
 Its decent enough to be a secondary Drive that can handle all my saves I use for games which loads really well.
 Good pricing... good product... u get what u see
 Bought drive for a transfer project which I finally got the time to do only to find the drive arrived DOA. Drive sat unopened in a cushioned case at the top of closet a few months, I doubt Im going to get any support on this. Running seagate tools, but everything failing so far. Drive will not initialize I/O error.
 I use this for all my GoPro footage. Works great, has great transfer speed for the price, no complaints. Will be purchasing again when I fill the drive up!
 This hard drive works great.  Excellent price, excellent reliability.
 These hard drives never worked in a computer. I connected them to a sata to usb connector in order to migrate a working hard drive and they reported &lt;100MB total space.<br/><br/>One of them went so far as to allow me to apparently copy a hard drive to it but then wouldn't boot and only reported 39MB after.
 A very reliable drive.
 But the date on all of them is 2013? Maybe it's new old stock. Seems rather old to be considered 'new'.
 Quick and works well with my USB external hard drive case.  great capacity and speed.
 Easy to install<br/>Fast drive for price<br/>Great for storage
 Using this in a RAID 1 setup on a Dell workstation. Works great.
 Almost couldn't get it to work without updating storage drivers on an older file system, but after that everything worked great.
 not an ssd but just as fast plus more secure than ssd I have owned several Seagate hdd great reliable products
 A good friend of mine got 2 of these in Dec of 2017, so in Feb of 2018 I decided to follow suit. I used the 2 drives in a raid 1 for the data redundancy while he was feeling fancy free and used the full 8TB. Neither of us have experienced any hiccups with the drives thus far. Will update if that changes.
 More than enough storage. Just the average computer user with a little gaming here. My boot start up along with my programs are all stored on this drive and there was no problems during setup. And booting up computer from shut down is under 20 sec. Cant complain at all.
 Super quiet and fast, lots of storage.  Using it on my Ubuntu 17.10 server for the home directory.  I can barely hear it even when hammering the disk.
 Easy installation.  Reliable operation.  Everything I expected.
 I bought two and it's been working for 5 months now no problem yet. No complaints and the price was right
 Let's hope it holds up... Get the $15 warranty to save any future heartaches.
 Works great
 Literally it worked the first month when I ordered my computer it had one In it but that one got corrupted. So I bought another one hoping that one was flawed but no dont but this it wont last
 Ordered in September as an intended (and recommended) upgrade for my PS4 storage. In mid October, the HDD started making a grinding sound upon bootup. When the normal PS4 HDD was in and active, no grinding sound was heard. Around the start of November, the HDD failed to read both of my FAT32 flash drives containing PS4 .PUP files for the OS configuration.
 DOA, sucks to have bought this piece for a build and turns out it was DOA. Be sure to check your HD when they arrive or get screwed like I did when I get around to the build :c
 Purchased and installed on a Windows 10 system. Had difficulty recognizing drive until we went in Drive Manager and enabled drive which assigned it a drive letter. It showed up in Bios but not in file manager. Worked fine after using drive manager. Quiet and fast, good price, would buy again.
 I notice it being a bit faster than the non pro version for sure, but the build quality has me a little concerned. It is very noisy when compared to the non pro version. I don't know if I have a bad drive from the get go or if all of the pro versions make more noise. We will see.
 1 of 2 drives failed on me.  The first drive seems stable, but the second drive made a screeching sound, and could not initialize.  I returned the bad drive to Seagate through their RMA.  It's been over a week, and there has been no activity to get me a new drive back.  They haven't even acknowledged the receipt of my drive on their online RMA portal, even though USPS says they delivered it.  I've had it with waiting for Seagate, and ordered a Western Digital blue for my drive and backup setup.  In owning Seagate Barracuda drives in my 10 year history with them, 2 out of 5 failed.  Terrible.  All four of my Western Digital Blues are still going.  I will never buy another Seagate again.  $55+$7 in return shipping wasted on this particular drive.
 It works
 I've left in my surveillance unit long enough so it has filled up and looped back.  Seems to be working perfectly and was simplicity itself to install.
 Good price for a great product.  Fast and reliable.  Had no issues with the installation and it has worked perfectly ever since then.<br/><br/>Update 24 Oct 18:  drive is still going strong.  Plan on buying a second drive soon.
 Favourite HDD I've ever owned. One no longer has to sacrifice speed for size. Or at least, the trade-off isn't remotely as bad as it used to be.
 It works OK but makes a funny noise periodically my other drives do not make.  Disk maintenance software says its ok. Still the lacks of any warrantee is a bit troubling given what I bought it for.<br/><br/> For general information I run it externally in a Black-X  USB-3 box. I have taken to using it<br/> intermittently.
 I installed it in an external drive case from OWC. I reformatted it for Apple and about a minute later it was up and running! I just hope it lasts for 10 years.
 Runs great. buy two and make a copy. No glitches no noise.
 Used this drive for just over a month and it died. I saw some of the other posts of failures but was too optimistic.
 Great drive, and pretty quick for a HDD.  I use it hold part of my Steam library.
 It is a great hard drive that allows boot to be quick and easy and does everything a hard drive should do. I recommend this to the user who needs more storage space for gaming or business desktop.
 Had this installed in my PC desktop in January. Don't notice any difference in speed from my old drive but at least it is stable.
 Oh no! My steam library is too big!  So I got this and added it.  It was really simple, plug and play almost.  Just had to tell Windows that it was there, and then to format it. Working fine ever since...
 Drive arrived safely. But I can only write to the drive and whenever i try to read something from it windows 10 will crash. (Latest patch. Pc is a ryzen 5 1600 16 gb ddr4 and a asrock b350m pro4)
 good!
 Good quality
 HDD ran perfectly fine, then less than a month in with my new custom rig the hard drive just crapped out. Don't think I can trust them again with their sorry ass customer service.
 Genuine product, not much to comment. The package came with an anti-static bag, Just a normal HardDisk, can't comment on reliability as I just bought it not long ago. Read and write speeds is fine, read speed roughly 168MB/s and write speed about 154 MB/s, the test was done from SSD to Harddisk.
 Who doesn't like a big hard drive?  Performing like a champ after many months. We only are using it for all the pictures we take on a Canon DSLR so not needing great response time. Good for our use.
 The product packaging was a little weak in my opinion. I used it in my PlayStation 4 as internal HDD. Install was easy with the nyko data bank. All my data was saved (installed yesterday). Overall, good product.
 Got it for my customers system upgrade. For Lenovo desktops K410 system . Fits perfectly in the HDD bay. Works fine.
 Bought in good faith as I have always had good luck with seagate. Never again.<br/>didn't even last 6 months before failure.<br/>DO NOT BUY.
 Works well
 Works as should. Holds lots of info. I have a few of these in a Drobo housing and it keeps everything backed up safely and secure
 been a good drive so far
 received the hard drive in time, on time, works fine, what more can i say.  I learned how to change out a hard drive, install the operating system,<br/>everyone has to learn the first time.  Thank you Amazon.com.  Satisfied ustomer.
 I tell it to save things, it saves things. What more can I say?
 I still would've liked to have gotten the 5 TB system, but it takes too much to go through the steps to get it to work properly 2 TB was just right. I could always add another
 ALWAYS am satisfied with and ALWAYS tend to in my tech business to go with seagate .
 I cloned the data off of a WD blue 1tb and noticed almost no loss in performance. The blue was already very fast for a hard drive and the fact that the experience was similar exceeded my expectations, especially considering the price.
 love Seagate hard drives never have any problems cant go wrong with barracuda  drives
 Product came in good packaging. Item is used as a secondary drive on my PC. I have the drive accelerated via intel optane. Item has been in use for several weeks and has had no issues so far.
 I am completely satisfy, just in time, excellent condition well protected package no issues, truly recommended thank you so much.
 Good solid product, no install issues. Great drive. Now if I could only find a SSD at this price...
 Amazing fast 3TB hard drive. Ran some benchmarks with it and got some amazing score, highly recommend especially for the price. Worth every penny if you need some more memory
 Great hard drive to have for games and applications.  This drive is used as my secondary drive to a SSD hard drive (Windows).  The price was great as well.
 Drive started spitting SMART errors almost immediately.  Knew there was a reason I was avoiding seagate drives.  Returning and buying something else.
 I slept this into my Atari desktop and it’s a speed demon
 Been using it for 5 months now, I load many files onto it daily. Had an old 500gb by them for over 8 years before it failed on me. I trust in them and will continue to buy with Seagate.
 By 2020, I’m sure these will be obsolete. 500GB SSDs will be $40 and you won’t need to get a hard drive. But this is the go-to for anyone who’s worried about storage and is new to PC building, as this was my first hard drive for my first computer.
 I use this as a media storage drive. So far it's working great. I use this with plex and everything loads very quickly locally and online.
 Works great so fat, pretty fast speeds for a HDD. Get about 200mb sequential read and 150 write.
 Works as advertised,  WIll purchase again!  :)  Bought 4x of them for small SAN,  no issues.
 make sure to Double check before you order. After reading the questions from other people, i was under the impression that this would work for a PS4. It does not. You need a laptop version. Otherwise these are good hard drives, just make sure you order the one you need cause the descriptions and questions are geared towards all of their hard drives and not this particular model.
 I bought two of these 4TB Seagate drives. I am now wishing I would have purchased Western Digital drives instead.<br/>One of them is still working, but I don't trust it. It might as well be a ticking time bomb.<br/><br/>Thank goodness for RAID.
 Purchased as a secondary drive for a file server which I store large videos and audio files.  Definitely an excellent value purchase.
 Fast, even though it was corrupted by the original host device, I was easily able to get most of the data back, and after a quick format, it works as good as new. I use 3 of these drives.
 The speed &amp; capacity are great, and the 5 year warranty makes it worth paying more for the Pro version. It's also a quiet drive.
 What i can say about a hard drive? well it's fast and... works (?)
 Quiet. User friendly.  Easy to install.  Since I had the side screws and cables from the last drive to transfer to this drive it was easy to install.  Haven't tested it enough to access further.
 failed. costly loss! the wd drive i bought at the same time is fine.
 The hard drive skips and makes games lock up. After just over a year the hard drive died.
 Like
 After a year of use it started failing, do not buy this
 i own 3 of these and will continue to add more when the time comes. Very reliable, high performance, great price, unbeatable. I strongly recommend for PC enthusiast.
 The hard drive was great while it was alive it still looks perfect and clean hasn't been touched or removed and it started making weird noises then I was like huh that's new and then I searched why is my hardrive clicking then it stopped working and all my data and important stuff is gone never buying Seagate again.
 It works well, but is slow to start, and noisy at start-up.  My Western Digital in the same PC is faster and quieter.
 Excellent HD, easy to put in my computer, wish it would have had a SATA cable with it so i could have put it in right away.  Had to turn around and order a cable which delayed the installation by a week.
 I am using this for backup and it is serving well.
 Does what it says it does. No issues with it.
 worked perfect for a month now only is 2 tb?  not sure if something happened or was defective?
 I bought this while refurbishing a computer, it was easy to install and works great.  I received it as advertised, New.
 The drive was as-advertised and suited my needs well.  It seemed pretty fast and it served its purpose well until it completely died 6 weeks after being installed.  The one thing you NEED from a hard drive is reliability for a reasonable lifetime (3-5 years) and it failed this primary need.
 its is a hard drive hard to tell how good it is but it it worked and I do like Seagate  3 TB is probably way more then I need but why not.
 6 months in no issues ! Drive is a bit above average speed wise i hear i guess but it isnt a SSD obviously. Quiet , stays right temp , ALL is well .
 I bought to this a while back because I was low of storage due to the fact that I use an SSD. This brought me an abundant amount of storage at a decently quick response time. If you need space and don't feel like spending a fortune, I'd recommend this drive here.
 Good drive for mass storage. It's a hdd, it stores things.
 It works well with my Mac Pro laptop. I use it with Dock from the same company.
 It’s working perfectly with my upgraded Home Recording Studio. Super fast 7200 rpm gives me no latency issues. The product has been tested over a good period of time. I got the 8TB which will give me a tremendous amount of storage. Highly recommended.
 Big *ss 3TB drive at 7200RPM for a decent price.  It also does not seem to have the major vibration/resonance that the Spinpoint F1s this thing is replacing had and under load it is quiet.
 Fit in my Synology DS418 without a hitch.  The NAS took a few minutes to set them up and I was off to the races.
 MY HARD DRIVE DOESNT EVEN WORK. I DIDNT EVEN KNOW TIL MONTHS LATER ONCE I FINISHED MY SETUP AND I CANT RETURN IT??? WHAT A BUNCH OF CRAP.
 Great Price, easy to install would buy another and would recommend this to anyone
 This replace an identical drive that went belly up. The old one was about 3 years old
 I've had this drive about 1 year now.  It's working great, nice and quiet, runs cool, and it is dependable.  All you can ask for in a drive.
 Great buys! Bought 3 for a Raid 5 array, and they are rock solid.  Would buy again.
 I chose Seagate, because my last drive was also a Seagate, which was a 1 TB it lasted 9 years. This new drive will be used as the old drive was, a media storage drive
 still holding up for now
 High quality, very useful
 great for storage. My son's Steam library is growing and this came in handy. 44.99 was the sale price at the time 12-2016.
 great buy for the price
 It worked, and provides decent speed for a mechanical Hard Drive.
 so far so good. the price was low and I have seagate externals for many years so i don't believe the hype about you need to pay more
 Rock solid performance for a media server!
 Works absolutely perfect for my first computer. Tons of space for downloading games and anime and whatever else you would like. Easy to install.
 My original review showed the ATTO drive test with 256 MB instead of the 1 GB test as used with CrystalDiskMark 5.2.1 x64.  Here is the correct (matching test) information.  That is why the drive speed didn't match.  As i stated, this is the most consistent drive that I have ever tested.  I apologize for using the wrong information to test the drive.
 This wqa great but it just failed on my so o need to purchase another one.
 Seagate is a brand I have trusted for over 20 years for all my storage needs.  The BarraCuda drives always meets or exceeds my expectations for personal and work.
 This is the second one I have bought and it's doing the job I need breathing some life back into my old Mac.
 Great read and write speeds! Very quiet.
 Encountered zero problems, plenty of space
 Excellent Item
 I use it along side my ssd drive, good price!
 A+++
 Fast Drive, I’ve only had it for a month and will update this when it fails. Windows did have trouble discovering the drive and allowing me to create a partition. i play games like Escape from Tarkov where loading times are of utmost importance because the earlier to the game the better chances you have of surviving.
 Works great and I have no complaints.
 Partitioning worked well, however, formatting was difficult.  Disc Check showed the disc to be corrupted.
 It’s a hard drive not much to expect but gets the job done well
 Works well so far. No errors and read write times ok.
 I was using this for an upgraded hard drive space on my ps4. I bought it on march installed everything correctly and it worked great for 2 months.  For some reason though now it "stalled" the PlayStation can't access it. Normally when starting it will hum for a couple minutes but now it does nothing...
 Replaced bootable Windows 10 drive with this product
 Excellent value for a 2TB drive. My Windows 10 pc identified it right away. Did a quick format and transferred my files from the old drive. Very fast and quiet.
 I would buy this  again. Works great
 I heard good things about this drive, so I bought it and installed it in my new PC. It never turned on or even registered on my MOBO and I took every precaution to make sure that it was installed correctly. There's no warranty, and you're out of luck if they decide that you must've installed it incorrectly. Don't buy it.
 It was a good price for 2TB, had it for about 2 months no problems yet. Using it for my Synology NAS. So good so far.
 Reacts poorly to fire and/or rare-earth magnets.
 Standard hard drive. The 4TB space is really nice. The 256MB Cache helps a lot with load times. Seagate makes a really kill product. 10/10.
 Still have lots of space...... I loveeee it and it’s cheap
 I picked up the drive to replace my old 4 drives in my DROBO and works great.  I did hear few of little bit of loud noise but seems to working just fine
 Best hdd our there and excellent for storing anything. Not sure if everyone else will have this issue but I had to activate mine in disk managent so watch out for that
 Not much to say..... its a fast, dependable hard drive. Drive was as advertised, and arrived as advertised. Ive been building PC's for over 20yrs, and have always used Seagate.
 Perfect Hard Drive for Back ups etc.
 Lots of storage with decent performance for a hard drive.
 My son ordered this to replace the one that was dying in my computer. So far, knock on wood, a month down the road, it's working great.
 It's fast, runs quiet, and lots of room. I've got Seagates that are 10 years old and still running, hope this runs as long.
 great hard drive. I much prefer Seagate over other brands. They tend to last longer.
 Product failed within 12 months. It is in a RAID server so luckily I didnt lose any data.
 Works Great!  Extremely good and reliable product!  The horizontal height is a little lower than other similar models which is excellent!
 Great product. I will recommend.
 love it had trouble getting the computer to see it,  did some research and found out how, wish there had been instruction, but the product is top notch.
 Lots of space for a decent price. Time will tell of the durability.
 Purchased this drive to replace a green western digital drive.  This one is better.
 Wish I had read the reviews because then I would have realized this came without Sata cables. Ordered 1 for data transfer and it fits just fine. Ordered one for the power and it does not fit. Need to connect to a six pin power source so can anyone recommend which cable I need to purchase?
 Paired this with SSD as a file drive.  Works great.
 The hard disk works well, but it’s kinda noisy. In fact, it’s the only hardware that’s more nosier than my CPU cooler and GPU, lol. It does the job though.
 I use this for a Clone Partition of my main drive, and Partition the rest for back-up Storage.<br/>I like seagate..
 I placed this drive in a case and am using this drive as an external hard drive. It works just fine.
 So far so good.  No issues and seems to be a good product so far for the price.
 So far it's running great with very little to no extra noise added to my PC.
 I have been using this drive for data and media storage also for image backups.  It works flawlessly. Performance and reliability is great, no problems whatsoever..
 Excellent.
 quiet and fast. I have 2 of these in a NAS.
 Great drive with a good price.
 great drive, fast. service was quick
 The HDD works great.
 A good budget hdd from a trusted manufacturer.
 Seagate the only hard drive I use
 It worked with iMac 2011.  Thank you!
 Price Good. Name Good. All Good
 Great product quality; On time; Great price; Great Seller!
 Bought 2 more on Prime Day. They work!
 Exactly what I expected and a little more. I’d highly recommend in any system needing a lot more storage. I run 1 m.2 2 SATA ssd a 2tb seagate and now the 8tb. I use the 8 for backup and the 2tb for a scratch drive
 Extremely fast write and read speeds for a HDD. Very impressed. Never falls below 75mb/s write speeds and that is the absolute minimum I have seen it go. Loving it so far.
 Drive failed after 6 months use
 It's a storage that works. No defects, no problems. Large size, good price, reliable amazon for any problems. No cons here.
 Better than the WD 2tb 5400rpm, same price as well.
 I ordered the 3TB drive. The price was decent. Unfortunately, the drive arrived dead. Well, nearly dead. It had the dreaded "click of death." Unusable. I've had bad luck with Seagate drives recently.
 This was all I needed for revival of my workstation. Windows is updating now. Everything is great!!!
 6 months and no issues.
 Drives work great (have mirrored), but, they put out a really load 'buzz' most the time.  Sometimes they settle down, but 'buzz' about 90% of the time.  I have tried them in multiple External Drive enclosures and they act the same - so it is definitely the drives.
 It's the same as any other hard-drive, which is good. This is the same as any other modern hard-drive, but for 3TBs at $84.99, that's a bargain.
 Works great once I realized that I had to go into disk management to set up drive
 Works as intended and don't have any problem with it yet. However, it does give a vibration and a very slight sound. I'm not sure how it compares to other HDD as I was only using a solid state beforehand.
 Amazing performance same capacity
 To use the entire 4 TB use AOMEI Partition Assistant. Ifyou have Windows 7 or older.
 Fast and inexpensive 7200 RPM hard drive. It cost about the same as the 5400 RPM WD Blue, so went with this one instead.
 I always buy Seagate HHD bucause i never have problems with them.
 Well... they wern't kidding. I load in first everytime! Here I actually thought it was my ethernet.. But if you think about it... Your harddrive holds that data! Hmmmm So how are you gonna load that data intake? A SSD or HDD OF COURSE! Love it.. Downloaded a ton of games now.
 Works great no problems would definitely buy again.
 Great Hard Drive, .....Be sure to use UEFI mode in your bios to access all 3TB
 Came exactly as described, easy to install, easy to format
 Always love Seagate drives.  Never have an issue with them and this drive is about as fast as you can get that isn't ssd
 Its a good drive but not for my needs, i found out after the fact that the 4tb version is 5400rpm(the description says 7200tpm for some reason, but pay attention to the cache. Bigger than 128mb cache is most likely 5400rpm), im not sure of the rest but i had to return it and get a barracuda pro, also doesnt come with sata cable.
 arrived quickly and was exactly as expected. Used third-party software to connect to system and copy from the old hard drive to this one.
 It hasn't died yet, which makes it a good HDD, however if you can find a &gt;real&lt; SSD for under $60 with 1TB of storage, buy that.
 Built gaming computer &amp; used this
 A good price on a 2Tb addition for my desktop.  it is now my media drive and I run plex from it sometimes.
 Works as expected, used in the PC I built, never had any issues and installation was a breeze.
 Works great I'm very happy with it
 Love this drive.  bought it to replaces a bricked backup drive, and it works like a charm.
 All Segate products ive have work Great,,,
 6TB seagate baracuda internal would not initialize on Mac or Windows. Returned.
 Has worked so far without incident, as fast as a SATA drive can be expected to be
 Item was Made in 2008- recycled junk- lasted  6 weeks before falling.
 Great fast Barracuda 4TB hard disk
 No issues here! Another hard drive easy to install.
 Worked great, no problems, passed SeaTools.
 Needed an extra drive for storage, does exactly that.  No cables in the box but that was no issue.
 I put this in my server as a direct replacement for a failed drive. it installed and worked without a problem.  Can't speak to the longevity (yet) but it works so far
 Works well, hands down an improvement over SATA 2 drives, and overall makes loading games much more appealing. Would definitely recommend
 Great drives for all systems, love Seagate products, almost never any issues.
 Holds all my files and runs quietly with good speed.
 Worked after I changed the formatting to GPT.
 Amazing speed HUGH amount of storage, Seagate is my favorite and this one is amazing!
 work great no problems
 I hear "clicking" sounds from time to time coming from this HDD. I will start return procedure with Amazon. Cant recommend. Sorry
 Function and price come together to give use this product. Low price for 3TB drive, plues warranty included with Seagate is awesome!
 Very good Hard Drive.  I don't trust any other maker of Hard Drives.  Seagate is the best.
 I like the thin form factor and my computer runs faster and cooler.
 Bought for my PS4. Easy to install. Will be buying again if I run out of run on this one.
 This is the Black Hole. And it actually works. No way to back it up, though.
 Very happy with this. Can steam 4k video sources on my network from this with no lag
 Nice addition to my quiet computer.  Using it for media storage.  Excellent price.
 I'm not at all sure how someone could be dissatisfied with the purchase of a hard drive.  It's got ONE job.  This one took it's place among it's nine brothers and became a file system on my NAS.
 Using as a slave and it is super fast.
 Worked great right out of the box. Not DOA like the WD refurb I ordered earlier from a different seller.
 Wonderful performance and very little sound.
 Seagate shows these as OEM drives, no warranty unlike what the product listing says. Hope they last...
 Does as advertised!
 I got on the Seagate website to make sure that this HD is in the Seagate current product line and it is! Given the $66 price that makes it a great deal.
 I’ve had it for a year and a half, maybe. It hasn’t died yet!
 I have several of these in use and no problems. Very satisfied, no problems. Thanks.
 I have never had problems with Seagate drives over the many years that I have used them. No complaints whatsoever.
 So far I've had these drives (I ordered two for different machines), and could not be happier.  They came on-time, packaged correctly, and were exactly as advertised on the Amazon page.  They installed into both machines with no muss or fuss, The read/write access time is an improvement over the drives that I replaced.  They are very quiet during read-write access which, while not a deal-maker or deal-breaker in my case, is a welcome feature as both machines sit on my desktop.  A fair price for a (so far) good product.  Time will tell as far as longevity, but I'll be sure to update this review if need be.  For now, perfectly happy!
 Products arrived in tact, without damage and works right out of the box without issue. Great job shipping and the product is excellent. Thank you!
 I had this same Hard Drive in an old PC from 2012 and its still going strong today.  So naturally I picked another one up for the latest build.  Besides the SSDs, this is a great addition for random storage.  Great product.
 Works well with PS4
 This is a awesome HDD.  i had my other SeaGate BarraCuda for 5 years.  I figured it's time to Update So, i got this 2TB BarraCuda Pro HDD.
 Very good backup system for the work that we do. Hold a lot of data for our business.
 Excellent product and easy to use.
 pricey, but it works!
 Using it as a back-up drive in a docking station. Have had for several months now and zero issues as of yet.
 Works great easy install
 Drive was DOA. They sent it using a soft bag with minimal Buble wrap. Pretty stupid for something as fragile as a mechanical drive. Waste of time
 This HDD is fantastic. The most I normally have is 1TB so having a whole extra TB for extra games is really nice. Over 50 games installed (from steam alone) and I still have 1.29TB left, and at least 10 of those games are 40gig+ games.
 Just stopped working after 2 months
 It's a hard drive. Price was right. Not a whole lot more to say. It's exactly as fast as you'd expect for a 7200 RPM drive, and it hasn't died yet.
 No problems
 Purchased this to be the Archive drive for a new build using an SSD primary drive. I have used these drives at work and in my builds and always been happy with them.
 CUDA CUDA BARACUDA!!! As always one of the best!!!
 It's a nice deal on 4TB it works just fine for holding my games.
 plugged in pc recognized it properly and I'm now restoring my data to the drive.
 Use this for my music only
 So far so good!
 Works really well! Easy to install. Got a recommendation from a gaming page. I have a 500 SSD and wanted more space for the other nonsense.
 I cant comment on durability but in the past they have been excellent. It was a breeze to install and set up
 Works as needed, fair price, Would recommend.
 Have never had an issue with seagate HDD
 No hassle, works great.
 Arrived on time.  Good price.<br/>Purchased this drive to use in my BLAC X docking station.<br/>Easy to format, sitting there doing its thing.
 Lots of bang-for-the-buck space. Run an SSD for the OS and you've got a good PC build.
 Great quality
 Not too bad works great as my game drive till i can afford a full ssd setup.
 Works perfect
 no problem to date
 Works as expected, easy to install
 Exactly what’s expected from a HDD. Nothing special, but gets the job done.
 Solid well functioning hard drive. Used as a replacement drive in my RAID 5 NAS
 It's been a few months and this drive has been going strong. Super quick and makes very minimal noise. I have an SSD, silent case fans, watercooled CPU + GPU and I can just barely hear this drive unless I'm really paying attention. Can't ask for much more out of a storage drive.
 GREAT! What can you say, it's a SEAGATE!
 A returning customer and appreciate the quality and reliance of Seagate products.  These drives are prefect.  Quick delivery as promised.
 Works great
 Been using it for almost a year now as a secondary drive and it works great. A little slow but that's expected from a physical drive. Really can't do better that this for the price.
 Drive works great! It's thinner than my old WD Blue 1TB drive, while also having 4 times the storage. I will definitely be buying more in the near future for storage backup/raid configuration.
 I am using this to store movies on a small home server. It works as advertised. I am happy with this purchase.
 plug and play excellent
 Good Service.  The product is installed and working. Don't know about its longevity.
 This was so easy to install even for someone like me who knows nothing about tech stuff.  So far no problems.
 No complaints. Quality hard drive.
 works good
 reliable and fast.  I've used them for many years and will for many more.
 This is great hard drive, if you are looking for a good and relatively inexpensive hard drive. This is worth the money.
 Great price, quiet drive with abundant storage.
 Works. Fine by me
 Usong in a dvr. Installation was easy.
 About what you would expect. 2 TBs. No issues installing. Transfiles at decent speeds. The games I have on the hard drive load better than average. No complaints.
 Installed this in my home PC and have all my games on it. Praying it never fails on me. So far so good!
 Great buy
 Worked perfectly. Swapped it in for an old 1TB, called it the same name, used Win-10 disk manager to recognize it, and my new library drive was good to go.
 Outstanding harddrive with great performance and good price.
 good
 Completely silent hard drive. Works great!
 I not only play a lot of games, but I record pc games as well as games from my xbox. This is the brand I will be sticking with once I fill up my 4tb hard drive and decide it's time for more storage.
 Great Hard Drive, love it and use it quite a lot since its my main drive for games in my PC.
 It's in the computer I'm using right now. I upgraded from a 500GB hard drive. Haven't had any problems, thus far.
 installed into my PC case with windows 7 installed, this one is a secondary hard drive and is working fine. No Probs
 These are the new drives in my server and transfer 11 times faster than the old school drives I had in there. SO much better! They are quiet and fast.
 Replaced a bad system drive on a HP workstation.  No problems to date
 Less than two months, it failed twice already and became unreadable. Piece of junk.
 I had this Hard drive for around 3 months and it died on me. I would reccomend like WD instead.
 Works perfectly.
 Great Drive, I game on it and load times are great coming from a 2TB Western Digital black drive.
 Great product! Works as advertised.
 As Described
 So far so good
 So far the drive works flawlessly. Fast read/write speeds and very good response time. No problems thus far. This review will change if the drive acts up :)
 Two days after my return date my hatdcdriver crashes...idk why hutbiy stopped working ...PS4 can no longer read it...I tried on 2 ps4's it was a great amount of space while it lasted and I had 100+ games downloaded ...trying to figure out what to do now...?
 Plenty of storage and it works fine.
 Best brand in HDD.
 Great drive. Makes a fast and more reliable replacement for my 10TB raid.
 I have never had a bad Seagate drive. This meets all expectations
 Works as need used for home CCTV. Great HDD.
 went out just after a month
 Added this to my work desktop for my Steam library. Works perfectly.
 SEAGATE... awesome HDD.  Easy to partition with windows Disk Management.
 Got this for $59! BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK! Although whenever the hard drive is activated it kind of sounds like a jet is taking off for a second. Doesn’t bother me at all. Very reliable no problems so far.
 This is a drive I admit I was a little wary of as so many people has told me the more recent Seagate Drives are not good. I have always used either Seagate or Western Digital though, so when this new model which was released on 7/8/2016 through their new Guardian Series of hard drives I really wanted to try it so with a little apprehension I ordered it. I am more than happy to announce that after using it for awhile now, the thing runs fast and smooth with no problems. It is way faster than my old Western Digital drive also and is used for my Steam Library which is constantly being added to with no problems what so ever. If you are looking for a decent amount of room for a price that won't make you cry, go for this. And for those who are worried about shipping, I ordered mine through Amazon and not another seller through Amazon so it came in a box with the plastic slots and anti-static bag in a box which is great. Those who have gotten it in just a padded envelope or anything obviously purchased it from another seller than Amazon, though they may not have realized it as it is easy to do for those not paying attention or they may even be new to the site.
 Integrated well in my PC. I was able to transfer a 1 GB drive to this 3 GB effectively and have more than adequate space for apps and the new Windows 10 OS. Great performance so far.
 I have purchased multiple of these for multiple notebooks.  They -always- work perfectly.  I never got a bad one.  In fact, I'm using one on this PC.
 Easily installed this into my cctv recorder box enough memory that I don't have to delete for 6 months. No problems
 Easy to Install and great storage for the price.
 Exactly what I needed &amp; expected
 works as it should
 Good. The only thing is that in the beginning I cannot formate it. I downloaded a software to make it.
 as expected, great product, keep in mind you will need a tool from seagate to recognize the 3TB otherwise you will end with a partition of 750 GB or so
 It came dead
 I installed this drive into a Drobo.  It failed within 24 hours.  I'm inclined to agree with many of the other comments claiming that these are used drives, ripped from an external enclosure and being sold as new.  I'll be contacting the Better Business Bureau regarding this seller.
 I bought it used and did not work at all!<br/>If you buy it make sure you buy it new!
 I bought this to upgrade my ps4. I was tired of deleting old games so I could play new ones. I followed the steps to install it and had it up and running in no time. I ran my ps4 several times the first week. I was really impressed with the load times on this hard drive. I downloaded destiny 2 for the weekend and played it for an hour and then I got an error. I could hear the hard drive ticking loudly. I figured I would try and start the process over to re install it. I can't do anything with it. My computer wont recognize it, my hard drive dock won't recognize it, nothing. I'm going to set my original hard drive back up and deal with it until I get a better hardrive. I'm sure if I got another of the same hard drive it would probably last the life of the console with no problems. I just happened to be that guy. Performance was great, I just got the doofy one off the line.
 Great quality at an affordable cost.
 Seems to work fine.  I installed it to replace the older one that was having issues and it is running.
 Works great, as advertised, no complaints
 Works great and no problem installing.
 Tried and true product, always dependable. Have many of these in multiple sizes.
 Ok
 Great purchase, easy installation.  The HDD itself is very advanced.  Quick compression and fast recovery of files and such.  I am very happy.
 If only it was easy getting it to sync with the PS4 with the databank that i purchased with it but we love it
 works, reliable
 Works great!
 It worked
 Good Price great hard drive.
 Good
 I have no problems as of yet .I think it's been almost a month that it got installed. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Seagate-2TB-BarraCuda-SATA-6Gb-s-64MB-Cache-3-5-Inch-Internal-Hard-Drive-ST2000DM006/dp/B01IEKG402/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Seagate 2TB BarraCuda SATA 6Gb/s 64MB Cache 3.5-Inch Internal Hard Drive (ST2000DM006)</a>
 Have been in service for 12 months 24/7. No issues.
 Bought this to use in a multi-camera security system. Working perfectly.
 Not much more one can say about this drive other than AWESOME! love the larger cache as this drive screams -- well performance wise anyway - it's extremely quite otherwise ...
 works great
 This was a perfect replacement for an old drive.  It's faster and much more storage.  The install was simple.
 Easy to install into the Nyko Data Bank I bought for my fiance for Christmas. Haven't had any issues
 great product Fast Shipping
 For my mass storage device in my new PC, this hard drive is fast and quiet. I haven't had a problem with it yet and with the Seagate BarraCuda brand, I know it will be top notch for a reasonable price.
 Great harddrive for the price cant find it cheaper anywhere else in town
 Works amazing.
 this has been a really good drive so far I've had this for about 3 months without a flaw.
 Good quality high speed disk drive.
 Great Product Fast shipping
 Dependable and easy to install and fast!
 Seems okay. Installed fine. Using as a secondary to a 120gb SSD and a WD 1 Tb blue. Packaging appeared brand new despite the other reviews on here. Was a good price for the 7200 RPM. Wouldn’t quite compare it to a WD black though.
 Working great so far! Very fast and reliable. Gave new life to my computer.
 I upgraded my ps4 and everything is great. My buddy installed it for a 6 pack and everyone is happy.
 works great, fast shipping.
 Great price for a solid SATA HDD. Seagate has almost always delivered and this is no different. Buy with confidence.
 I bought it for my grandson so he can build his own computer. Hasn't used it yet but said it was a good piece that he wanted.
 Hard drives got thinner now lol. I didnt know that. But this hard drive benched at a great speed
 I just got my hard drive a few days ago, but it's working like a champ. One thing to note, you will most likely have to initialize and format it for it to be read by your OS if you're using Windows. This is done through the partition manager, which in Win 10, when you launch it, it will automatically pop up with a window stating this hard drive needs to be initialized. You also have the option of formatting the hard drive through the classic format, or the newer format which supports over 2tb in Windows 10. I do not believe the support for higher than 2tb for an internal hdd is supported in earlier versions of Windows, but this is my first 2tb internal drive, so I am not 100% sure.<br/><br/>Speeds are definitely faster than my WD Blue drive, but not quite as fast as my primary SSD with the OS on it. I normally have 1 game installed on the SSD, but with this installed, I no longer want to do that. I may be a bit old fashioned, but I prefer having a large buffer on the primary drive for pagefiles :)<br/><br/>Anyway, Seagate makes quality products, and you will not be disappointed with this. I do think a lot of the reviews talking about DOA drives are from less tech savvy people who did not initialize and format, as I described above. I don't know for certain, though.<br/><br/>Another note: The drive comes in a smaller package with bumpers, wrapped in an anti-static bag. It looks like an OEM drive, but it DOES come with a warranty, for those curious. IIRC it's a 2 year warranty :) Hope this helps!<br/>-CymTyr
 Easy to install
 I wanted another hard drive for storing games and this one works perfectly with zero problems, at a great price.
 did not work, dead on arrival... returned
 I paid for a Seagate Barracuda SATA 8TB but HDD delivered on 22nd Nov 2018 was less than 5TB(4.54TB), I did not discover immediately as I had no time to install the item before leaving for a trip. Amazon claims return window is past. It’s so sad to pay for so much for a 4TB
 👍🏻👍🏻
 Just what I needed!
 got it for use in Zosi security DVR, works great. Easy setup, fast access speed.
 Seagate is noted for great products and this one is no exception. Thanks
 Reliable, affordable, good brand. Works as describes in my home NAS and I would buy it again for the same application if I had the chance.
 Seagate has made excellent hard drives I have been using them for over 20 years in the IT industry.
 My old HDD was being extra noisy. This one is quiet and has plenty of space.
 Product seems just fine. Quick shipping, no issues.
 These drives are terrific. I have many of them. Always happy with their speed and longevity.
 It’s a hard drive, what do you exspect?
 Not sure if it was a glitch but drive failed after 3 days. MBR failed to load so reconnected and it's been ok since then.
 Wonderful for Mass storage on your computer and is pretty fats as is.
 Good hard drive.  Inserted it into a Sabrent usb 3.0 external enclosure and was up and running flawlessly in 10 minutes.  Runs quietly.
 Sufficient for my needs. Can get a bit loud but not a dealbreaker as my case is pretty much right next to my head.
 Good for the price. Made my spare PC run a bit faster than when it had a cheap 120gb in it.
 It works like it should and hasn't had any issues (yet).<br/>Pretty good price point for so much storage
 Great product.  I liked the first one so much, I bought another.
 A Seagate product I wanted and is working fine.
 Works well. Reliable so far for a few months in my new pc
 Incredible
 No Problems here
 A+++! Thank you!
 good product. good price. fast delivery
 For the money It's my pick over the Firecuda.
 very good deal, happy with that
 Seagate never lets me down.
 Muy buena
 Fairly easy to install, and worked immediately, no fuss no muss, the way I like it!
 This brandname has been the only that I trust most, they are like the CRAFTSMAN brand name made for performance and durability
 Nice Harddrive that works with just about any computer parts you have, no matter if they are older or newer.
 It runs great and have had no problems. Thanks!!!
 As far as I know it works fine.  Thanks.
 No problems thus far.
 Worked great no problems
 Can't go wrong with Seagate. Works as advertised. Good purchase.
 Runs pretty fast on the benchmark tests and does what it's supposed to do.
 Description show the BarraCuda has 3 yrs warranty. After registered, learned that this drive only has 2 yrs warranty. Please update your description.
 Works great
 Works great. I 'll let you know if I have any problems so far no problems.
 It alright
 product is good, but recommend to buy SSD, this HDD is very loud.
 After a minor hiccup with the first order, I received my hard drive in good working order. Required minor configuration to show up, but seems to work perfectly. Very happy with the service and quick delivery times.
 Great addition to my new gaming pc, awesome product!
 Using this for a game storage drive and works great. No issues and decent HDD speeds
 Excellent price and performance.  Very happy so far.
 Awesome product very happy with it.
 I accidentally ordered a pc hard drive instead of a laptop one but decided to buy a wav link hard drive USB connector, and i dropped it pretty hard 2 times and it still worked, it comes with its full terabyte since I'm not using it as my primary HD, awesome for me.
 Ok drive.
 Lots of space, cheap price, decent speed. I think I'll buy another, thanks.
 Fast, easy to setup, no issues.
 Product shipped quickly, easy install, works great. Saved hundreds of dollars by installing myself
 Decent drive for the price.
 I bought 3 hard drives and put them all in PC at once and they perform really well and are really reliable.
 Good mechanical driver, decent speeds for a 7200rpm drive, cheap.
 Tanks
 This hard drive is very fast and very affordable for what you are getting I would recommended this over any other 2Tb HDD any day!
 much big upgrade over my old one
 Great price for a great product. Fantastic piece of tech! Super fast, very reliable HDD. Seagate makes some great gear.
 Works great and no problems
 Ok
 AS DESCRIBED
 It's 4tb and it fits in my computer. What more do you want?
 Works great so far, no issues.
 Wonderful
 just in time to fix a problem i had, works wonderfully,small edit.
 Finally got a chance to plug it in, a month after getting it and nothing. Doesn’t read no matter what I connect it too. It’s been years since I’ve had Seagate and this is why
 As always, Seagate makes great drives
 Ordered 2 to install in home server to replace smaller 1 TB drives. Got same as I had but larger as they have worked well and had no problems other than needing larger drives.
 Great!
 Lots of storage, fast for a hard drive and reasonably priced.
 totally great. put 4 of these in a desktop and you have serious storage.
 Very easy to install and use. No problems.
 Works flawlessly, just as I expected.
 Works well, no problems so far. I would definitely buy it again.
 Not noisy, speeds are good. Great drive for storage needs as I already have three SSDs / NVME drives for actual work.
 Easy intallation.<br/>It came in a nice packiging.<br/>Write speeds range from 300 - 400mb/sec.<br/>Read speess are similar to write.<br/><br/>Paired it with a 240gb ssd and I use it as my media, downloads, backup.
 This guy has a good amount of storage, and still works. It isn't that loud, either.
 Installed  two of them in NAS362 Raid 0 in November so far they're working fine without any problem quiet (though I have hearing loss ;-) ) according to NAS362.
 Nice speed and quiet too.  Excellent price as well, perfect for upgrading an older PC.
 This is a good drive, but it came with two partitions, with the second partition unavailable and I had to took a long time to get it to revert.  I had to call Dell tech support, who immediately expanded it.  He explained Windows 8 and later requires GPT/GUID formatting, the old MBR only allows up to 2 terabytes.  Which was a huge hassle -  I had to back up my data twice and then reformat the drive as G{T.  So if you get this drive make sure you reformat it before you start using it.<br/><br/>That was an enormous hassle and a big time waster. At the very least, the manufacturer should have a big label around it telling you to reformat it if you use a higher level of windows.
 It just works
 One of them blew out on me for no reason but heck the new one works and is great.
 Seems to be a little slower than others, maybe I just got a dud. Still works fine though
 I've been using this drive for about a year, no problems whatsoever which is all you can really ask for with a hard drive. Western Digital drives have given me so many headaches, definitely going to be using Seagate products in the future
 Doing just fine in my son's Ubuntu 17.10 Steam rig
 Exactly what I was looking for, no issues ordering.
 No problem fix of data storage server
 I was sold a defective one. First red flag was that it came in just a static bag inside a manilla envelope. No retail boxing even though i specifically ordered new.  Hooked up to multiple cables that read a variety of hdd but got nothing from this.
 Faster than I expected, will definitely buy more when necessary.
 Disk upgrade for a server at a very reasonable price
 Drive failed pre-maturely after a few months of use. Called Seagate and they don't stand by their products. Choose a different company. This drive is not the drive you are looking for.
 great product, no complaints.<br/><br/>the only thing I want to shared is about its better buy a bigger one than 3Tb because gets full easily.
 Worked well
 Works very well, fast, good price, no issues. I have used seagate drives for years, never had an issue.
 Great Drive
 So far is working great with no problems
 Bought this in August and it crash and died with a disk geography error. The data is proving to be uncoverable
 Worked like a charm in our security system. Everyone in the neighborhood comes to us if anything seems out of place.
 As described, except I'm surprised a SATA cable wasn't included, but I have one anyway
 Drive is fast and set up very quickly. Not frill sjust function.
 Bought two.  One as a backup drive and the other as a CLONE.  Both work very well.  Also, pretty fast at 7200 RPM's even when using USB 2.0 speeds.
 No problems
 Great product
 The Seagate BarraCuda drives are my go to drives.  Dependable with great performance.
 Great!
 Very quite and worked great for my camera NVR
 Excellent drive I am going to order another one.
 used it on my build works great lots of storage
 It was all good until my hard drive bit the dust after having it for little over a year. Had purchased it for my PS4 for better storage. That's the only reason why I'm giving it 3 stars.
 VERY Happy
 Good Product!
 Died after less than two years.  Usually have good luck with Seagate, but not this time.
 Fast and quiet, the HD the unit was easy to install.
 works great. no hardware issues so far.
 It’s a hard drive, does what it’s supposed to. Load times aren’t as fast as my SSD but they’re not excessively slow either. Tons of space for all my games and files.
 Installed and working fine. Had to buy some new cables because they have changed the power plugs since my old box was built.
 It works!
 works well. needed a replacement for my old one. works as described
 Working like a champ.
 Worked perfectly didn't have a problem installing. Packaging at great
 Working what else can you say about  a hard drive.
 use it for backups, works well.
 Installed and works perfectly without any issues - highly recommended
 Excellent!
 Works great like most Seagate products that I have had.
 Looks good, packaged VERY well, well protected and does what I need it to do.
 Great price and fast delivery to, I'm a very happy camper.
 I am used to loosing drives overtime so i really font worry about lifespan, but one thing ive got to say say is that this is a really good drive  for the price and i am having 0 problems with it so far.
 Good little hard drive
 We've bought nearly 50 of these, and we're getting literally additional years out of our equipment.
 Does what it is supposed to do.
 Good product, arrived ontime and works well.
 Fails on chkdsk faulty drive right out of the box
 has worked perfectly since install. Smooth and quiet operation.
 Fast. Easy. Reliable.
 So far so good. Definitely good to always have more storage.
 Use the drive for photo and video drive. Works great
 Installed without a hitch. Works beatifully.
 Great HD that works very well.
 Wish it included a manual because I had to run a format through the device manager, assign a drive, and name it before I could even use it. I'm not technically advanced but thankfully I knew enough to get it working.
 Works perfect and cheap
 Use as an second drive for data -Works great so far!
 Bought what i thought was 64cache cuda, but it seems its only a 32cache... which seems to be corrected on the page, but not in my order lists
 Bought 4 drives for a synology NAS.  2 have failed so far in a year.  .500 might be great for a baseball player, but for a hard drive.... not so much.
 So far so good. This was bought to serve as the storage drive for my main desktop. Spent 2 days upon its arrival running Seatools to make sure everything was good. For the past month, it's doing great with approximately 12-14 hours of uptime per day.
 Decent hard drive. Works well. I haven't had any issues with it.
 Great Harddrive!
 Easy to install and works.
 Don't buy this.  Bought this as a data drive, but failed after a month and a half, just outside of the return window.
 good for a cheap HDD
 Does what a Hard drive should do.
 I used this to replace the hard drive of my iMac late-2009. Works perfectly!
 Purchased six drives for two RAID configurations. So far no problems!<br/><br/>Packaging was fantastic. All drives were separately boxed and sealed.<br/><br/>Will hopefully get some good run time out of them.
 Works like a charm as a replacement.
 Great product, does what it's supposed to.
 Works fine.  Replaced similar drives in RAID 10, good performance.
 Great Drive for the money
 Great HDD for the price. Fast, reliable, and cost efficient. I use this to store my games and programs.
 It works perfectly, my HDD fried in my computer so I had to get a new one,  installed windows on it and everything works as it should!
 Working fine till now
 Works well, just a little noisy when spooling up.
 Working great so far. Bought it right before a sale... of course.
 Great!
 Good item
 Shipped fast and as advertised. Great storage product.
 Works perfectly, and delivered ahead of schedule!  Highly recommended.
 using for saving photos and video  no problem yet
 Awesome 2TB storage at an affordable price.
 Works well shipped quick and installation was easy
 Package was delayed by a day, it was n not a big deal,  we received a notification of this.  Package was sealed and packaged good.  Downfall of buying this system is getting a hold of Annke, wired hours,  usually have to leave a message someone calls back (always been the same day) problem is I can't understand them and vice versa.  Otherwise great product
 This is basically my go-to hard drive when I need more storage. I have gotten many of these drives and they work great, are relatively fast, and fulfill everything that I expect them to.
 Works great in my 2010 iMac. Just installed the 2TB and after researching how and using YouTube and Google we were able to get it up and working. So far so good!
 Built my first pc with this as my hard drive. Perfect easy installment and came with everything I needed.
 Came in damaged, returned
 I have two hard drives and an ssd in my machine. This one handles the heavy lifting (of all but start up files-on ssd) of data storage. 1TB is plenty of space for my home use, especially when you consider how much is saved in the cloud now.
 tons of space could be cheaper though
 Greatest purchase yet.  Needed my gb space. Easy to install and I'm a 70 yrs old lady.
 Got it up and running with 3 partitions, with no problems. Very fair price point.
 I bought this for my home security system DVR works great. It was very easy to install as well.
 Seems to be working good so far. I bought the ORICO toolfree enclosure to put it in. Ps4 instantly recognized it. Formatted it and moved Witcher 3 to the hard drive (took about 9 or so minutes for 53gb to transfer). Seems to load into the game about 10 seconds faster than the internal ps4 drive. Drive is really quiet. Happy with the purchase.
 slightly louder than the 1 tb i have, but does the job
 Your mileage may vary, but my favorite over the decades has been Seagate.<br/>No problems at all here, working perfectly.
 Great performance so far
 I said get it
 So far, excellent. Had to set GRP instead of MBR to use entire drive
 Amazing, has not let me down. Also its very quick, i am pretty impressed
 I installed two drives into a NAS and they are working as a mirror of each other.  So far, I haven't had any issues.
 Works Perfectly!
 Can't make a full review without using it a month at least. So far, the HDD working good without bad blocks/sectors. (HDD Sentinel checked for no errors). However the initial response time accessing the hdd is a bit delayed; this behavior could be normal for regular hdd's. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase
 Had these drives before. I like them for their performance and quietness.
 would buy again
 Everything is running well! A+ experience.
 I bought this drive to use externally for a DVR. Works fine. Still going. Would buy it again.
 I use it to boot a second OS for games that don't play with Win10, as well as hold much of my steam library on. Works well and doesn't have any issues.
 Outstanding drive.
 Great multipurpose HDD<br/><br/>Windows 10 PC
 Perfect, Thank you.
 nice item.
 Good hard drive. Good prices and reliable.
 very good product
 Bought this a few months back. Waited tell a week ago to put it in my build (slowly stock piling parts) Plugged her in only read 548mb. Hard drive failed out of the box... I sent the new failed one to seagate, and they sent me another one back. It was dead out of the box too.
 They work great. Bought two for a hardware mirror and they work great.
 I bought for friend as a gift.<br/>And friend is satisfied with the quality of this hard disk.
 Functions very well. Good all around test drive. Will eventually do a permanent install.
 Nice product fast shipping
 Working great so far. No noise, speed is decent, no errors.
 Good product
 Seagate is pretty good stuff. Never any problems.
 Great for dvr
 Excellent product and very good delivery time
 So far so good, not much drive noise, fast and i'm happy with the price of the 3TB drive.
 Great drive, runs fast, no issues.
 No comment gave it away was to big for my computer. Please check your sizes first.
 good
 I added this drive to one just like it in a PC that I purchased and set up a raid-array.
 Fast drive! Runs well in my new PC.
 It does the job.
 great HD, I set it up so install games, and keep my pictures and videos, kept OS on SSD
 Great for steam libary
 Great capacity and price.
 So far so good.
 Great storage upgrade! For some reason i had to use a different computer to partition it for the intended computer, but everything else was pretty straightforward. Until SSD's drop in price, this is a great deal.
 As advertised
 Uses for a DVR security system work perfect.
 Work perfectly
 Love the size however the startup time is slow. It is noisy like others said but it's in a game room so I don't care about that.
 Great product
 Not a problem with the drives at all, would be nice if they came with mounting screws though!
 Great price and arrived fast.  I just needed the extra storage capacity  and with these two drives in a mirror configuration this purchase gave me redundancy that means I’m nearly bulletproof against data loss.
 easy install on my zosi security system
 Works fine. Seems sluggish, but that's most likely on me being used to an SSD
 Works great, great price
 GREAT
 Works.
 This hard drive makes a LOT of noise and really annoying while I'm working on the computer.
 Works as advertised!
 It works like every other hard drive.
 This SSD is OP.
 In use for 9 months now.  Works as advertised.
 Received it fast...installed with no problems...used windows diskmanager to partition it and so forth
 Great item very fast
 So far so good, will update after few years!
 Hard drive works well.
 Excellent product, I recommend!
 Installed Windows 10 pro and works great. Very fast with no issues so far.
 So far, so good- I like it.  Good speed.  Hope it lasts better than my last two WD Black drives.  Had to leave WD.
 its working just fine. well see time will tell
 so far so good. transfer speed using usb 3 clocks in the 100s of MB :)
 So far so good, doing what a HDD supposed to do.
 Nice, fast drive.  Upgraded from older 320GB
 I found this drive to be very reliable and very quiet.  I have three installed in my network attacked storage.
 does the job
 Can't beat the performance for the price... would buy again!
 Arrived alive, good storage space. Speed is decent, just what I wanted as a back up drive.
 Fast and reliable, no issues so far (been a few weeks)
 Works Great lots of storage!
 Good product, no complaints
 Works as expected. Bought it to upgrade my daughter’s computer and ended up buying another for son’s computer.
 Best bang for the buck wanted a WD however the price is quite steep. A fair alternative.
 Good
 The extra space really helps for my game library. Very pleased so far!
 Lots of storage for my pc
 It works!
 Quick ship, just as described.  All in good order.
 works very good
 A+
 WORKS GREAT FOR MY EXTERNAL DRIVER
 its a hard drive, looks like it was new, product id said so as well.. should last for some time
 So far so good, but the little chirp when it spins up is weird.
 Works great so far!
 Perfect price
 A little loud, but gets the job done.
 Arrived on time.  Worked out of the box with no issues.  Been running for 4 months.
 Great drive. Perfect for DVR. It does not get as warm as a Western Digital, maybe because Seagate drives do not have the malware/spyware that WD has.
 works fine
 Quiet and affordable hard drive. Quick response when accessing information.
 Very happy with this storage device! Great price/performance and easy to install. No complaints!
 Exactly as described, nice fast drive at a good price.
 The drive has a lag in Win 10.
 Does the job for a great price
 very godd and fast drive
 Great HD for the price. Can't go wrong. Month in and so far so good
 Seagate is definitely one of the best hard drives out there.
 Very pleased with performance.  Quiet and fast.
 Works great.
 Works great
 Amazing
 5 STARS
 Great hard drive at a good price.
 Ordered a computer from Ibuypower.com sata cable and HD was damaged. Didn't want to wait weeks or months for replacement parts so ordered and installed myself. Very happy.
 Love it, will buy again for my next computer build.
 Seagate hard drives are best so far, if you ordering make sure you read specs as each hard drive serves unique purpose... I got 4 TB and next time I will get 10 or 12TB
 Works well, not super fast but it wouldn't be when I'm used to SSD's. probably deserves 5 stars.
 Just BIG.  Lots of room.
 The drive failed in less than 3 months.
 Nothing like a good old barracuda for storage. Fast for an HDD and price is very good
 Easy to install,  works great!  Very quiet.
 Came dead on arrival, never got it to work. Continuously gave an I/O error when trying to partition it, went trough hours and hours of tedious troubleshooting to no avail.
 Thank you.
 A month in, and it hasn't broken yet. Not much to say.
 As described, no complaints.
 iMac is up and running again.
 Purchased on 01/20/2017 had some trouble trying to get the OS installed.  Saturday 02/25/2017 the hard drive completely stopped working and is now clicking.  5 days out of return window and NO way to contact for support, aside from the manufacturer.  Not impressed.
 Excellent product!!
 So far so good. Still working - 8/15/2017
 Great internal disk drive.  I have bought 2 of these from Amazon before and they all work great.
 This is just fine. Plugged and played and formatted up just fine with Linux.
 This is the loudest harddrive i have ever heard. It clicks and thuds and whirrs and whizzes all day. I would strongly recommend NOT buying this hard drive.
 Got it as a mass storage for my desktop. The extra space was lovely, and it's great with an SSD boot drive.
 Worked very well, as advertised. Quality product from Seagate.
 works great with no problem
 It work fantastic. A definite upgrade to my previus PS4 500GB memorie, dedenetly worth. Do note that in the software update step its only compatible with 3.0 USB Drives, almost returned it cause I couldn't install the update. Other than that its great
 muy buen producto
 This is a standard, get it if ya need it, you know?
 Fast for gaming OP AF<br/><br/>So LIt<br/><br/>FAst<br/><br/>SO GOOD ANY MOTHER BOARD WOULD LOVE IT<br/><br/>GOOOD<br/><br/>YES ITS GOOD<br/><br/>BUY NOW<br/><br/>FISH LOGO<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Doesn't have 50 Watt LEDs
 Nice
 High quality, shipped fast would buy again!
 great deal, quick delivery!
 Holds all of what I need.
 super
 I've got two of these. The 1st I bought a few months ago and the 2nd just recently. No issues so far. Recommended..
 Perfect
 worked just fine and ship fast
 So far so good!
 Great hard drive, fast and a great value.
 Awesome price and must have for any Pc build.
 office
 Great
 Its says 3 year warranty on here but when I check the warranty it only says 2 I am pissed I would have gotten a western digital
 good item my husband was able to rebuild his computer and its working great.
 Worked that's all i could really ask for from this hah
 Good!
 I've been using this drive for a couple months now. Its working great!
 Dead on arrival. Very displeased. Ordered for my mom and installed 3 days past return window(first chance I had to go to my mom's). The reviews for people receiving crap hardware from Seagate are true. Stay away from these drives!
 I received this product dead on arrival. It didn't startup at all.
 As always a great drive that works perfectly
 Dirt cheap 2TB of storage that more than fast enough to hold a huge game library on.
 worked for me
 For a 5400 RPM drive it's pretty fast.
 Great hard drive.  Wrong size.
 Just bought this a month ago and now started hearing a weird drive spin noise from the drive. Need to reach out to Amazon and request a refund/replace.
 The item is as expected
 Worked in my Amcrest DVR
 Replaced a dead drive. Works well. No complaints.
 working great!! no problems so far with this and using this as my gaming back up drive
 this is a great hard drive using it to store all my games on
 I thought it would fix my ps4 but I had to return it
 Nice upgrade.
 No issues after 8 months of use.
 Formatted without error and placed into service.
 Works great
 No issues, has all the memory i need and i'll most likely buy another in the future
 Been working great for mem
 Drive failed after 3 months!
 Nice affordable hard drive with decent read and write speeds
 Quiet and quick
 terrible drive! many bad sectors after few month of use
 Nice
 It does what its supposed to
 Good item
 Replaced another 500GB BarraCuda SATA drive that had 45K + hours of run time.  The drive I replaced had no errors on it just replaced as a precaution.  Great product!
 I used this internal hard drive for my PS4 and it worked perfect! I have 2 TB of storage and this was a good price for how much memory it gives you.
 Install two weeks ago in a ps4.  Runs great, I have no complaints
 Good
 I bought this for my security system, working great, no problems so far.
 works good ,Using as storage in a gaming rig,OS is on an ssd
 Love the drive !
 Replaced a new ? Toshiba X300 6TB HDD that would not be recognized by my PC with this Seagate that worked perfectly after I installed it.
 this drive installed perfectly and works well. very fast. I would order it again
 It is what it says it is, pretty quick drive, great to go alongside an existing SSD.
 Brought new life back into a couple of 2007 iMacs. They will last at least another year!
 good product would buy again
 Great storage capacity. I was able to download a ton of high storage video games and programs such as Steam, Total War Games, Deus Ex and more. Like all hard drives it's hard to install if you don't know the process of setting it up when you get the computer running.
 As expected
 Ok
 Put in my security camera recorder.  Works well.
 Prompt delivery Nice product
 didn't work straight out of the box..
 Works as is.
 Replacement drive for my 2 drive Seagate NAS.
 Does what it's supposed to.
 Hard drive replaced old 250 GB hard drive on the server and it works great. No more unexpected shut downs.
 He says it was awesome, easy to install and works great.
 Works as expected.
 Started having trouble after 1 week. Would cause system freezing using various raid and built-in controller cards. Not a fan of Seagate, should have gone with another brand.
 works as intended
 As expected. No complaints.
 Cheap and works like a champ.
 Had it for 4 weeks.  So far no problems.  Very fast drive.
 great disk drive as always
 As always I am pleased with this company and their products
 The speed is fast.  I like the 256MB cache.
 Great drive so far. Not as fast as an ssd but fast enough for me.
 Totally satisified, been running 24/7 for over a year now.
 you get your 5th star when and if i still have it in a few years, for right now it's a solid drive with a good price.
 Totally 1TB and looks like the picture.  Would buy again if I needed it.
 Cant beat Seagate for hard drives.
 Item was returned for a different product prior to installation.  Realized when I got the drive that I needed a different one.  No problems with the sale or return/refund.
 This installed easily and has been working great since I installed it two months ago.  Much quieter than the drive it replaced.
 Excellent product, works great no problems at all.
 Curious how well this harddrive performs in a year, but other than that. Wonderful HDD. I'm running this on a Asrock Z87 Killer mobo, with a I7 4770K chip.<br/><br/>Benchmark<br/>Sequential: Read 177 / Write 172 / Mixed 154 / 126% 167 MB/s<br/>Random 4k: 4K Read 1.02 / 4K Write 1.6 / 4K Mixed 0.28 / 103% 0.97 MB/s
 Got it in 1 day of shipment...nice!
 This is a great hard drive for the money! Honestly no complaints!
 Great hard drive and easy to install. Just make sure you create the partition if you want to use as a secondary storage device. If it will be your primary (OS installed) the installation process will do it by itself.
 Good
 Great stuff thanks
 Arrived and works well.  Easy installation.  Get a SATA cable.  Not included.
 Great harddrive, still works after months of use!
 Solid, Fast, fair price, quite, easy to install, famous brand company name, and working fine till up now. Fast international delivery.
 Pros:<br/>Compact<br/>Pretty huge buffer size<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Amazon tech specs didn't match the actual product, such as the device model code, and most importantly it was showing 7200rpm, actual product is only 5400rpm. (Might be planning on returning it)
 Work guest for my application.
 Much love for Amazon. Perfect 👌🏾
 I like it
 Been using it for 6 months fast and reliable
 Great product great price
 I ordered a 3tb and only got a 2tb<br/>would like a refund for the difference between a 2tb and a 3tb hard drive
 if only microsloth worked this well...
 First time I install hdd to my desktop and run it,I heard clack sound one time,I worried about it,but after that hdd run normal status,no click sounds or annoying noices,very decent hdd I suggest you all.<br/><br/>Quick Cargo after shipping arrived after 10 days<br/>I cut one star cuz of they waited me 4 days for nothing.
 Works as expected.
 Good speed works as described .
 It is what it is! Lol
 this was an excellent choice
 Nice hard drive at a nice price. Very easy to install!
 Great Product! Great Service!
 Great hard disk drive. It is quiet and fast. My last one lasted nearly 4 years. I would buy a Seagate again.
 Good drive. Like it.
 Bought the 2 TB variant. No issues recognizing and formatting in my system. Using this for all my games!
 No issues after 7 months
 As described
 Used it for a surveillance system. Works great!
 Works good
 So far it's performing okay. I really have huge expectations for this 'classical' hard drive.
 Excellent hard drive pretty fast
 works great at a good price.
 It was great price and easy to install. Nothing to dislike here. I use for games on my computer along with my ssd.
 Solid drive
 worked great for the large storage
 Just wanted a desktop computer for work, plenty of room with this product no issue at all.
 Same as other people here, I get an audible clicking noise every 4 seconds or so. The write speeds are honestly the worst I've ever seen, and not to mention the 200+ unstable sectors as soon as I installed it. 0/5 Do not buy this drive.
 great for my longer term storage
 Works well in my custom build. I upgraded from 500GB.
 works great and its fast
 Always use Seagatemedia..  Been my motto for years.. Been using Seagate for all my Mac Pros for years..
 Great drive, fine value as well. THANKS
 Didn’t work at all , has to return it
 The product worked as advertised.
 Great price for a lot of extra storage space. No issues at all installing.
 Works great
 Drive died 2 months after receipt.  Expect better.
 Very nice 👍 de and
 No issues does what it should.
 Works great. Price was fair.
 good price
 Been using Seagate for decades.  Great price and performance.
 This is a good Hard Drive. I put all of my steam games on it and it runs well. It is very young right and we will see how it runs as it ages but for now it is not bad. I enjoy using it.
 Easy to install. works well, fast drive, very satisfied
 comes bare bones just the drive in anti static bag
 10/10
 Our Son &amp; I gave it to my Husband, because he needed a larger harddrive.
 Very noisy ( might be a defective product)
 I purchased 7 of the seagate barracuda new model internal hard drive! 1 went bad about 2 weeks ago and today another drive failed and needs replacement!
 I am happy with this hard drive and is working fine.
 Haven’t used it yet because the description does not notify customers that the drive does not come with cables or screws...would be nice to know. Now I can’t install or use it until I order a sata cable and screws. Disappointed
 I ordered a 3TB hard drive to replace my old drive that was failing. Turns out I didnt actually get a 3TB drive, but a 2TB with a 3TB sticker on it. Very unhappy, I feel like I just got scammed.
 Thank you..! I hope buying more HDD from you it has been working good for a great price :)
 2 TB of free space now on my PC. Can't argue with that.
 Good
 Works great in my gaming pc
 works great, great size.
 Works great good value
 Relatively fast, coming from a 5xxx RPM drive.
 Works great.
 Very easy to install. I bought a windows 10 disk for $8 on eBay and got it installed quickly. I have used it for a few months now on a gaming rig and it has no problems
 Great! Just as advertised!
 I always go with Seagate when getting spinning HDDs. Best life span, performance, and bang for the buck.
 Works great, easy install, pretty quiet
 First have more storage now on my PS4, but you have to buy the Japanese expansion divice, need I say more.
 The item defective motherboard not recognize
 Big enough for me.
 So for some weird reason my hard drive croaked after 6 months meaning that it just went corrupted and after formatting it games just don't install on it like it used to. I am really just about to consider having two SSDs.
 I bought this drive on Aug 8th 2017 and the drive failed on Sept 21 2017. This was not a good purchase, would not recomened.
 Got 2 DOA drives in a row. Just sent the second one out for a refund and purchasing another 2TB drive from another manufacturer.
 At $69 this is a great buy for 2TB worth of extra storage!
 So far so good!
 No issues with this hard drive so far, great price, comes packed in antistatic bag as well as suspended in the box to not touch anything.
 Lots of space.
 I bought this Item, and it never worked once I never got to store anything on this Harddrive. Very disappointed and their is no returns on this item. I am very upset in waisting my money $65 down the drain and I never got to store anything.
 Very good product!
 perfect
 works as intended
 bueno
 So far so good. Built a new computet and has been doing it's job so far!
 Product failed with him 45  days of delivery serial number sold as is no warranty, according to Seagate.  Amazon returned it claiming a one-time exception to my account.
 had to buy this to replace one in my raid setup. only been a few years.
 so far all works
 Works great  Holds a lot of stuff
 Storage and a lot of it. It runs fast enough for most games. GTA is a bit slow but it's not horrible.
 Best choise for the price.
 Easy set up works well I use it for dish storage.
 Great find! Made Well!
 Great
 Great
 It's a hard drive and have not had any issues with the hard drive.
 Excellent Seller, Product and Price. Thanks
 This, as well as another Seagate drive have failed on me; and they are less than 6 months old  :/
 Fast harddrive with a large Cache.
 ok
 Nice packaging, works well.. very fast!
 Great drive, lots of space.
 Good drive
 does what I need ti to do LoL
 Works great and was at a great price as well.
 Works well.  Easy to install.  Good HD for not much money.
 work as expected.
 Works great
 The reading and writing sped aren't the ones written . It's cost to have a 16 Meg Cash and it's only giving me 7 . It's great for storage but not important stuff It's to unstable
 Used this drive before and have had great results. Would definitely recommend
 Awesome
 The drive is well made and runs smoothly.  Performs as I would expect from Seagate, excellent.
 Great product at great price for my gaming computer I built!
 Worked great for a PS4 slave and came at a great price. No performance issues.
 Lots of room to have anything you want on your computer.
 Bought from Amazon Warehouse and it didn't work. Tried several methods on several computers, I wasn't able to partition it on any of them. Most of them wouldn't even recognize it
 Replaced my drive and it works well. Set up and installation is quick.
 for my HTPC. Super fast.
 i have been using this HDD for a couple months and it's been working great for games and other mass storage programs
 Good value for the price. Seagate drives have always been my choice.
 Seagate makes quality drives, and this one was priced right for my mid range gaming PC build. 1tb is a good amount of space to download games.
 It's working great. Previous one was on it's way out and a techie friend recommended this one and installed it for me. I'm satisfied.
 Great shipping and product. A solid hard drive you can depend on!
 931GB in actuality. Decent product though.
 Overheats.
 Does the job, no issues.
 works it was right price
 Using this in a security DVR. Easy to set up, has been working flawlessly since install.
 Great drive and this is my 5th one. All still working with no issues at all.
 Works great, after formatting it was easy to install and set up in my desktop.
 Love this drive  - have used a few with friends and family computers and no complaints
 Plugged it in and good to go.
 Awesome! There is nothing else, I know people are going to say don't buy it! But this is 2TB and cheap too!
 Pros: Works like it should! Lots of room for my steam games.<br/><br/>Cons: None so far
 Producto de excelente calidad
 We bought 2 first one garbage out the packaging 2nd one stopped working 2 months in.  Do not waste your time or money on these refurbished paper weights cause thats about all you could use it for.
 Very affordable.  So far no complaints.  I highly recommend.
 Has about 2.75 tbs. Roughly 2 tbs more than I actually needed. Still works great though.
 Great Service/Product
 Okay
 Working great, So far no regrets on this 7200 RPM HDD
 safe fast and reliable
 Good product
 This was exactly what I was looking for. I already owned a 2TB Seagate GoFlex Home NAS. After a few years the drive in the GoFlex started giving hints its failure was imminent. Before the failure happened I ordered this drive and used it to replace the failing drive.<br/><br/>NOTE:  This is a bare drive; you will need to format it before use.
 great product.
 Fast shipping, Excellent Hard Drive. Anyone could install it.
 I purchased this drive 90 days ago and it already died. Enough said......
 No qualms; works fine as replacement drive for my NAS' RAID array.
 Great hard drive.  After I got a tech to load the basics on it, I have been using continuously.<br/>Shipping was fast thank goodness because the hard drive being replaced was dead.
 Everything ok.
 It does what its supposed to do.
 Perfect for the Nyko databank for a PS4 I was upgrading to terabyte usage
 Works well for its intended purpose.
 Works great and easy to install
 It's all you really need. The price is good and more than enough storage.
 The hard drive works as expected for the last 3 moths. I had no issues using it on both Windows and Ubuntu. Good product.
 Works great very fast on start up and games.
 Good buy.
 It works perfectly in my computer system
 No matter what I save it only writes 1's and 0's.....😉
 Arrived quickly and as advertised. Thanks
 excellent
 Great product
 Nice solid built drive. No complaints
 good HDD so far no issues
 Seagate everyone, you know em!
 Works great and is relatively quiet
 This hard drive is OK for its price; however, recently it has begun making squealing noises after about three months. Not only are these noises annoying, but I fear that the hard drive may fail soon.
 September 2018 and June 2018 Seagate Barracuda Internal Hard Drive 8TB are both reporting as failed by Drobo. How and What is Seagate's 3 yr warranty going to work?
 Great price, fast shipping
 Information on this drive was pretty mediocre.. Drive is only 5400 RPM. Drive works great for what it is. Seems to be pretty good. It makes a light hum but definitely not as bad as most. Much quieter than I was expecting for sure. Giving 3 stars due to lack of information in item description and people answering questions wrong in the Q&amp;A section without anyone correcting it.
 item as advertised.
 Works great
 Great Product Great Price.
 Installed this hard drive in about 10 minutes, formatted it, and it has been working great ever since. Definitely a bang for your buck.
 Excellent replacement.
 To easy works great
 Installed easy Son loves the extra storage for his games
 Installed quickly to camera distribution box and work excellently.
 have not had any problems so far
 oh yes beautiful  I was able to installed most of my favorites game from Steam and Is till have plenty of room
 Best
 Perfect product...works perfectly.....
 Bought for a friend, love it.
 Unfortunately the 2 TB hard drive failed less than a week after purchasing it. At least it didn't happen later on when I had valuable data on it. I probably won't be purchasing any Seagate drives anymore. It's a shame to as the last time I purchased one it failed as well which is the reason that I gave up on Seagate. I will have to go back to WD or Hitachi.
 I run my system on these.
 Be careful, amazon is advertising this as both speeds and if you dont look in depth enough it will appear as if this is 7200RPM
 Great harddrive it runs perfect with my computer
 Works great. Would buy again.
 Great price, fast shipping, replaced my dying older drive.
 perfect
 Works as expected, no issues (3 months)
 Hugh storage, name brand - time will tell long long it will last.
 great hard drive, nice and fast
 Prodict, which costs 100$ should have little screws to attach it to PC. Now I have to waste time to find them and wait couple days for delivery. Nonsense.
 Shipped as described. Perfect.
 No complaints, this HDD does everything it's supposed to.
 Bought this to use on my Media Server as a Storage Drive. Have had it running 24/7 since I bought it and have had no issues whatsoever with it. It’s fast and does what I need it to do.
 Quiet, reliable and fast.
 So far so good! No cons!
 thenks
 Works as described
 Works great
 Using it in a personal NAS. Fast enough for my needs and working great!
 Just wait the computer doctor ordered
 Works great.
 Plugged it in, it worked. Excellent Amazon product!
 workin great so far with speeds as expected, great price also.
 It's a Seagate, what else do you need to know? Tried different manufacturers early on and always ended up back with Seagate. Haven't used anything but Seagate since 2007.
 excelent
 Perfect. I love the product. I’d recommend it.
 Works great!
 SEAGATE IS MY STANNDARD
 Best cost per performance for a bit of extra storage.
 Ordered 8 of these, all work fine so far.
 Fast!! Works great huge storage!
 good item
 Used in a DVR set up. Works perfect
 Just what the PC Doctor "Me" ordered..lol  :D
 The drive I received only lasted ~3 months and is now giving nothing but issues.<br/>Probably an anomaly for other buyers but my personal experience was poor with this drive
 Great
 Works really good for all my games
 Came in the mail a couple of days ago. Kind of worried it would be a nightmare to get working, so I put it off till I had a day more or less free so I could sit on hold with tech asst if I needed to. This morning, I pulled out the old disk and reattached the cables to the new one and screwed it into the bay. I have operated with a dual boot Windows/Linux Ubuntu machine now since November 2016, and I'm really happy with Ubuntu (haven't opened Windows but one time since I installed Ubuntu). Linux runs a much better hard disk management tool then Microsoft, imho, and the Linux hardware troubleshooter began to warn me of an impending hard disk failure about two weeks ago. Well, my Dell is five years old, so I wasn't surprised. Please note: You have to be very, very careful when you order your disk from Amazon to get the right one, duh! And there seemed to be two possible choices for me, but I went with the one I thought was correct for my mother board, and figured I'd straighten things out if I ordered the wrong one. So I had the Ubuntu installation disk in the DVD drive and performed the smoke test. And man . . . everything went slick as pig snot and all for less than $60! Now all my apps are working, the install even found my printer and it works fine (printer drivers used to be a problem with Linux). Yup, even Netflix works fine (used to be a problem also). So I guess it's officially bye-bye Microsoft! Thanks but no thanks, Geek Squad. Thank you Amazon and Linux!
 tons of space at a great price.
 great value here!  dont pay 250.00 retail for this!
 Works as expected.
 Very good HDD, fast read/writes, big storage for 7200rpm.
 Works great in my Hackintosh
 Excellent hard drive
 This drive works great!  Not much more to say.  No issues here.
 not damaged
 6 months of continuous use, so good so far!
 Used for a new computer build as a secondary hard drive to store the majority of the content on my computer. It has plenty of storage for the 20+ games on my computer and they all launch fast and run well
 Cheap and efficient for hudge data like videos...
 Great price, great value and great performance. Just as advertised.
 I buy seagate all the time. No other hard drive brand! I have over 32TB of space
 I was going to actually scrap my ps4 and get a new bigger better 1tb one until I came across this!  Thank goodness I looked into this first!
 Perfect for rebuilding your girlfriends new computer
 Easy install, and lots of fast storage (For an HDD). Not much else I can say.
 Item replaced hard drive in an older computer. Works as intended
 Regular hard drive so not much to say, i had to purchase a cheap computer and chose to upgrade the hard drive, helped a lot.
 Installed it in my 27" iMac. Ready for anything I could need.
 easy to install and load. Very fast drive.
 Inexpensive and works fine so far.
 You get the most for your dollar by grabbing one of these
 So far, it's great
 Very happy with it.
 So far so good on this Hard drive.
 Arrived on time and as advertised. Working well so far.
 Very, very fast and somewhat quiet. Would buy again if needed.
 I've always been satisfied with Seagate and nothing has changed!
 So far so good
 Only had it for a few days now. But I can say it's worth every penny I paid for it. Great price.
 the noise is too big
 Works great. I have 8 if these drives for data storage. No issues.
 I've ordered 3 of these in the last couple of years and 2 of them have failed.
 I use this as extra storage for games on my PC. Works faster than any other HDD I've ever had. Works great with my 256g Intel M.2 SSD.
 Great hard drive fast works great
 love this hdd
 Great on Price and performance, the speed for the backup met my expectations
 as advertised
 As describe. Used this for a CCTV system. Perfect capacity for 4 camera system. Sannce brand.
 Love it. No regrets
 As advertised no issues with the product
 perfect
 Finicky drives. I bought two of these 4TB drives to supplement 8 2TB drives on my Mac mini server. One formatted correctly at 4TBs and one would only format at 1.8TBs so I exchanged it for another. These drives do not work with all SATA drive bays. If I had to do it again I would have bought 4 more of the the 2TB models and saved myself a lot of grief. OS X 10.13. The other drive on the first order is going back as well. It's serial number is not in the Seagate database so it can not be registered for the warranty. It may well be a counterfeit product. These drives stink as bad as Seagate's F'd up website. DO NOT PURCHASE THESE DRIVES!!!!!!
 I am pleased with this product.
 Works great. With the prices so low it's worth upgrading to larger drives.
 Good
 Cheap price to replace a failed drive.  Always loved Seagate drives for their reliability.  Believe I have had only two Seagate drives fail in the past 20+ years whereas other brands have been less reliable.
 Everyting
 Worked great, good hdd
 The drive is fast and it works well.
 Works great.
 Works great.
 It's ok for the cost.
 Ordered two identical 3tb drives thinking I was getting a deal over the competitors option but I was dead wrong. Both drives were dead on arrival. Never bought seagate before and never will again.
 good product, fast shipping.
 Clone software works well. Drive works well. Good shipping packaging.
 This is an amazing hard drive especially for it's price and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking to upgrade their storage.
 So far so good. Hope it last at least year. Never had much luck with Seagate drives...
 ugly amaze
 Works great, fast delivery
 Works perfectly as a backup drive
 2TB me gusta gracias
 This replaced an identical drive that had finally failed. Works just fine..
 seems to work as it should
 Great hard drive!
 Excellent and fast
 It's definitely a good product for the price.
 Super fast shipping and easy install!!  Happy with this purchase
 Good hard drive
 it would get five starts but the hard drive they sent me dose not work its defective it plugs in fine an fits but it dose not register on my pc
 Came new and worked just fine. Copied files from my old drive over and am now using this.<br/>I will say that I haven't noticed any speed improvements over my old drive, but that's not why I purchased this one.
 Exactly what I expected
 Awesome product, very pleased with the purchase so far.
 Great!
 Lots of space and quite
 These should not be advertised as NEW.  They are ripped out of external drive cases and sold as NEW.  These drives have ZERO warranty with Seagate.  Completely deceptive.
 Works for my iMac 27
 more than enough for my computer.
 Works  well
 very good
 Working very well, no problems at all. Buy it.
 I bought a western digital black 2tb that came in broken and I bought the 3tb barracuda and it comes in and works perfectly. I love seagate they never fail to succeed for me.
 I just like Seagate drives.
 works great
 Best HDD I ever had so fast
 Awesome!
 Perfect to store games!
 It is what I ordered and it performed as promised...what more is necessary?
 Arrived on time, installed easily, works great.
 Works fine!
 Works great!
 Worked fine for the first two months and started making a chirping noise and no longer worked. After reformatting, it only lasted a few more days before it failed again.
 As advertised.  Pretty good writing speeds
 after a year, it still works amazingly cx
 Works very well for my intended use of storing video files. Fast and long life for good price.
 Excellent product. Very satisfied with the purchase
 fast drive works great
 pretty fast for a mechanical drive, has plenty of space for my games and other stuff.
 Have only had it for about a month, but runs smoothly.
 Found it easy to set up and appreciate the Seagate reliability.
 Has made an obvious difference in the boot times of my operating system and some programs. Is it as fast as a true SSD? No, never will be either, but it is a good compromise.
 Perfect for my new NAS (see my other reviews).
 Works as advertised.
 Awesome drive at a great price
 works great
 Installed as my secondary drive for storage, formatted and installed in seconds.  This drive is so much quieter than my other  - - drive, Initially I heard what is best described as occasional chirps but Seagate asked me to run the tools on their website and now it is silent.  Fast and quiet, great for those all in one PC's or a tower.
 works as should replaced a failed hard drive in a alien ware
 Works exactly like I needed it to.
 Cheap price and powerful
 Worked as a hard drive should. Yields a final usable size of 931GB.
 works fine
 First one came dead on arrival second one works fine. Atleast amazon has good customer support.
 I installed this 2TB HHD in my Funlux security system for recording. It works great with my system.
 Worked great ina PS4 Databank. Fast speeds and no problems.
 Good read/write speeds and all good so far in a NAS environment.
 Arrived on time, fast in games (these guy has 7200RPM rotation) and i never had problems in the past with Seagate products, recommended!
 WORKS GREAT!!!!
 This is the only drive out of 15 that went down. All others are still going and have been running for over 10 years.
 Little slow and not amazing maybe its only my one. But still wprth buy cuz it good
 It’s a HDD work great already &amp; all of my Steam games are on it.<br/>It does not make noise also.
 Drop in replacement. Up and running in minutes.
 Exactly what I wanted. Great price.
 Genial
 Functions as advertised.
 Product arrived on time &amp; is good
 did not work - when connected would make noise for a while (30sec or so), but then stop, could not format or access at all. tried on three different systems - same result.
 nice storage
 These two drives were 5 months out of warranty on arrival.  I returned them.
 Very easy to install and works great
 Great
 Great dependable drive. Fast for non SSD and good value to TB cost
 WORKED GREAT RECOVERED ALL MY OLD INFO, WORKING FINE SO FAR
 They are working just fine!
 Good product worth the purchase, high capacity, decently fast speeds, four stars because it did not come with a SATA cable
 As promised.
 So far, so good.  Drive installed easily.  Performance is great.
 Exactly what is specified
 So far it is working nicely. Passed all diagnostics.
 Well what can I say at this point? It has only been a few weeks, but it seems to be working as advertised. I did, however, expect this to help me get the ladies but since it is only 2TB so no one is impressed. I will update if anything changes.
 Goes inside the computer and does a very good job!
 So far so good works just fine.
 Good deal, works great
 works great
 Great price and performance.
 Drive already failing... Not my first Seagate but this is "clicking" way to quickly...
 Fast, reliable second drive in an HP Elite mini tower running Windows 10.  Easy install. Needed to be formatted to be recognized. The only drawback was that the included backup software did not work as described so I just used the Windows 10 backup tools.
 great storage drive.
 works fast and perfect!
 Great hardrive
 Works well in my PS4 with the data bank.
 very well
 Corrupted 4 days after installation.
 Good item
 Works as it should.  Good service from seller
 Arrived on time.  Now in use.  Seems fine.  I now have four of these, including the one that came in my HP computer.
 a
 Failed after 3 months. No return policy.
 Great drive exactly as it's supposed to be. Solid value and reliable.
 Good disk but it is a little bit noise
 Honestly one of the best HDDs out because of the price to GB ratio, pop a few of these in a raid config and you're set for picture or video storage.
 Working well thus far.
 Arrived quickly and great price!
 Yeah, this is a 2 TB hard drive.
 Second Barracuda drive owned and very satisfied with the product.
 Super, very happy
 Huge upgrade over standard HDD...  Much much faster boot speeds
 Much speed such load time so wow
 Works perfectly without errors.
 Me encanto
 Its a HDD works great I got the 2TB and couldn't be happier
 Works well. Makes a noise when it starts up so hopefully it will last
 Affordable storage
 Quick, solid, quiet, reliable. Recommended.
 Love this drive its fast a works great
 VERY fast read and write speeds.  4KRW speeds could be better, but not a problem with this price point.
 works fine!!!!!!!
 It was working well at first until the second day that I received a blue screen cause of the drive. I was able to repair it until I had problems with it again. I have tried calling Seagate but sends me straight to voicemail.
 Worked great. Arrived on time.
 So far, so good.  Easy to install, I don't see any performance issues.  Mainly use it to store my games and play them all from this drive.  Works like a charm but let's see how long out last.
 ***** Excellent
 I've bought lots of these BarraCuda drives over several years and have some that are 7-8 years old. Very few failures.
 Works great!!!!!!!! Thank you!
 Great drive , easy install ,
 No complaints. Good drives.
 Gotta say really impressive performance..
 As advertised, I will definitely buy for this seller again.
 Was working great. System was running smoothly, games were loading quickly, the PlayStation store was loading faster. Then after a month of use my system can no longer access my storage. I can't even start up my system in safe mode. Not sure if it's my PlayStation or the HDD.
 So far product is of good quality, performance is as intended. This was a good buy
 It's 1tb he not much more to say about it
 I've used the Barracuda for years with never a problem.
 It works. It benched about 50% faster than the 1TB drive in my old computer.
 Great storage at pretty fast read/write, no complaints it does what it needs to<br/><br/>Would recommend this to anyone who needs extra storage
 Thanks
 I am VERY VERY upset at Amazon for misleading advertising.  Just received this and was urgently needed.  NOT ANYWHERE does it say this drive is a refurbished drive.  When it arrived it was very obvious that when I opened the outer box and saw the contents that the drive is a refurbished drive.  You are NOT buying a new hard drive but rather one that is refurbished.  Not even sure you would benefit from a full manufacturer warranty since the drive is used/refurbished.  Disgusted at Amazon right now.  This might very well be my last year of paying for Amazon Prime.
 Backup storage - Really worth the price
 it works
 works great cant beat the price very happy with the one i got fast shipping and great shape put it in my alienware works great
 It says 7200 rpm in the description then 5400 rpm when you scroll down. Very misleading.
 Didn’t work for by dvr
 this works perfectly, holds a lot of memory for my games
 Fast read and write speeds.
 perfect
 Transfer 500GB data, speed jump between 2-90MB/s. From copy detail I saw a lot of files (20MB photo file) take 10 seconds. That is 2MB/s.<br/>Use Atto benchmark test on this one and compared to two WD disks.<br/>Right picture - this disk internal SATA.<br/>Left picture - Dell internal SATA
 Stable and works as it should.
 No problems, works as it should. Great deal
 My hard drive came dead on arrival, and now I need to send it beck and get a new one
 Gift for husband. Exactly what he wanted
 Recently installed one in my NAS since the 5th HDD died. I’ll give additional info later on as it is utilized.
 Kinda slow, but an easy and cheap way to get more storage
 As expected good quality
 Works as expected.  I use it in a Sabrent USB 3.0 to SATA Hard Drive Docking Station and together they are excellent.  No issues with either so far.
 Great Drive.
 all in all the unit works perfectly and i had no trouble initializing and formatting it took literately min to format ,but for future customer i would advise looking into  the items the hard drive come with i had to go and buy a sata cord and hardware for it and i found it very inconvenient
 Great product
 arrived damaged and not working.This item did not come in a retail box or any box at all.
 As described , thank you
 2tb, under $60.00 I can't complain. Easy installation. works great.
 Hell it's a hard drive!
 WORKED great as soon as I slid it in to my My Mac Pro.<br/>Watch out for the HDs that are advertised on the internet: some are used and pulled out of storage systems.<br/>I received 2 DOA units one after another. Buy new.
 big enough ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) to store all my games for now
 It's an affordable 3TB SATA HDD. That's it folks, the specs can be found in the documentation put out by Seagate if you need to know the exact expected speeds. They run a little faster than WD Blue, and only slightly slower than WD Black. Compare the spec sheets, it's a fun read :D These are waaaay more responsive than the 2 TB Seagate Surveillance drive they're replacing. These drives do not use shingled storage, so write times should be decent compared to NAS disks.<br/><br/>It's a spinning disk that runs at 7200 RPM. It's certainly not the fastest thing on the market, but hey, I'm spoiled with SSD's for my boot disks. I have four of these drives. One I've been using for over a year now, the other three are going to be used for RAIDs eventually. Currently they are running backup duty. I haven't had any issue with any of them mounting correctly and taking NTFS formatting.<br/><br/>New computer build will be getting four for a RAID 10 with a Ryzen CPU. I'll update when that happens? Ha, probably not.<br/><br/>On a side note: I stuck one spare in a desktop as a boot disk... Oh man... I miss my SSD boot disks.
 Great drive as far as reliability, performance and price. Has plenty of space for my everyday needs and was easy to install.
 I have purchased 4 Seagate drives over the years and never had any problems with any of them.
 Does exactly what I expected
 Massive storage and cheap price.
 Installed as a replacement in a computer based video surveillance system. Drive powered up quietly and has been running with no issues.
 this HDD did not workout when i tried to connect it inside the CPU.<br/><br/>How can i change this product to another that actually works ?<br/><br/>Please contact me as soon as you can
 Great
 Met Expectations.
 Easy to install, EZ 2TB, recommended if starting
 Great product
 Great drive. Good compliment to my SSD M2 on my motherboard.
 good product but not what I was needing
 works great and easy to install
 Great Price!
 Works perfect with the unit, very happy with the 3tb
 Great HDD
 Excellent
 Hard disk works as expected.
 Process was very smooth. Item delivered with no issues!
 Alot of memorie for so cheap love it!
 I recently purchased this product to build my new PC.  When I connected this Hard Drive through my SATA cable as my secondary storage after I already installed windows through my SSD. I rebooted winndows and was sent straight to a constant and endless windows loading screen. As I sat there in front of my newly built PC, I was  wondering why my OS wouldnt boot up passed the loading screen. After hours of researching, I figured  out that it was a hardware problem and that it only happened when the 2TB HDD was connected.  In the rare occasion that my mobo does detect the HDD in my UEFI settings, it was read as a 4.1 GB storage instead of the advertised 2TB.  I'm disappointed in the quality of this product coming from amazon, and I hope that problems like this is not an ongoing and common issue for this company.  Please be aware that this might happen to you.
 DOA, what a joke.
 Ok
 I would recommend this hard drive to others.
 excellent, very fast, quiet
 Thanks
 Worked perfectly. Thanks
 Works great.
 Great product
 works great
 appears OK, will let you know....
 A lot of storage for a good price. It seemed to make a weird and alarming noise at first but that might have been the drive enclosure on my CoolerMaster HAF X. The case is getting old and the grommets are stiff and cracked. I had difficulty getting the drive attached to the enclosure and one of the four was knocked out when I had to force it into the drive bay. I was too frustrated to attempt to fix it for the 5th time or so. Regardless, the noise hasn't come back so I am guessing it was my case and the drive settled into position. Rather reckless on my part but the data is backed up.<br/><br/>The sequential read/write speed is incredible. Around 230MB/s. That is unreal. The random access times are much worse than my Western Digital Caviar Black 2TB drive and pair of very very old Seagate 500GB drives in a RAID 0. I expected that, but it confirms that this is best for mass storage and not gaming.<br/><br/>There are a number of reviews complaining about reliability. I am hoping that is a vocal minority but checking the SMART data doesn't show any problems. Any drive can fail at any time though so if the data is that important do a RAID 1 or perhaps an external drive to protect against the rising ransomware threat.
 It works fine and shows in the bios as a 2tb hard drive but in windows 10 it shows the hard drive as only 2gb worth of storage. I've tried everything and it still shows as 2gb. Please help! i cant find anything online to help.<br/>-thank you
 Haven't had a failure yet...but its only been a month and a half. (I knocked on wood with my fingers crossed writing this review)
 Works great
 Work great, and same great quality I have come to expect from Seagate
 Great drives.
 Running in a RAID1 configuration... have had no issues.
 one of the best drives i've ever bought
 Working as intended
 Value and speed, what else could i ask for?
 Works well and fast
 Hard drive died after a couple months
 It is more than I expected
 Doing the job!
 So far, so good...Hopefully it will last longer than the one that came with my computer...Only time will tell.
 Worked so well I bought another.
 My experience of Seagate hard drives has been very good. I have bought about five 1TB and one 2TB drives and they have all worked fine.
 NAS drive.  I've had to replace 2 to 3 drives on 3 occasions in 7 years.
 Well build.
 Good price!
 Failed after three months in my Drobo
 No problems so far. Thanks!
 Worked perfectly instantly
 A bit slow but works great for the price
 WORKS GOOD
 just what i needed
 NO WARRANTY - Do not buy, goes bad in months and there is no NONE warranty - only a subcontractor did it dodge from Seagate
 Arrived very quickly and does exactly what it is supposed to do.
 Good drive for the money. Very quiet and seems to be fast response time.
 very wall
 no problems
 Good product, had no issues so far, unit shipped in a fairly safe package.
 works as expected faster than older versions
 So far, so good.
 Best hard drive for the price.  Just as good as any Reg SSD.
 Very good great for people who do YouTubers and streamers!
 Works perfect 10/10
 I bought this hard drive for the extra space on July 12th, it's September 8th now and the drive has already failed.
 Excellent hard drive, and price.
 GREAT PRODUCT!!!!
 Good product, received as mentioned for beats studio, recommend this buyer
 Item received as expected. Great quality! Recommended!
 works as it should.
 After using few days hard disk stopped working..And I have no idea if amazon replaces it or fix it...And my $100 was a waste..
 I love it. Thanks.
 Does not work on my nvr
 Cheap,  quiet and fast. It's enough i think.
 Great deal.
 Good product fast shipping!
 working as intended
 IT'S A HARD DRIVE
 installed and works fine
 Seagate barracuda 2tb hard drive arrived well packaged and in properly working thank you!!!
 This is an upgrade from my previous hard drive. Easy to install.
 EXCELENT WORKING LIKE MAGIC,
 Came in without it's box and I know for a fact it's going to be a dead Drive on arrival
 it is good
 Gonna keep it short and simple but the first one was DOA had to order a second one to finish my build.
 Working perfectly fine. Took the place of my 3TB, that died after 4 years, which I never filled past 1TB.
 Extremely happy with this hard drive -- as a replacement for original HP all-in-one, it has 2x memory and processing speed.
 Great hard drive, it's all you'll need.
 Works as expected.
 Exactly what I needed, product as described. Used it to build an old computer
 Did not work. Going to call Seagate for exchange or return to Amazon.
 Great product, great price.  Thank you!
 So far so good
 GREAT
 This harddrive will not hold windows. It is defective and I dont know how to return it for a new one.
 It's a hard drive...
 I am still waiting to see if this works. One of my Drobo NAS 4TB drives was on the fritz, so I ordered two of these 4TB Seagate drives. One to replace the faulting HDD, and one to have as an additional backup. When I began to place the Seagate into the Drobo, I noticed it was not fitting quite right, and that there was more space in the bay (thickness wise). I removed this new Seagate HDD and set it on my desk next to the Hitachi HDD it was replacing. There is a HUGE difference in this Seagate 3.5" HDD compared to the 3.5" HDD's I am used to. This new Seagate HDD is less thick by nearly 3/16 of and inch! That is a big difference when dealing in hardware that fits a predetermined size that has been universal for a loooong time. I am trying it anyway, and it seems to lock in fine. The data rebuild has been going on for over 10 hours now, stating 9 left to go. This is also longer than usual. I am wondering what the deal is. I must have missed the memo about the technology thinning in size
 This is very durable and easy to use
 1 year using this hhd it still great and fine
 working great
 Used in an array of several other drives in my DROBO NAS.  Less than 2 months and HDD already failed.  Too late to return.
 Good storage space for most.
 good
 nothing special but works
 This HDD was exactually faster than I had expected it to be; read and write speeds are exceptional, I'd say the price is low considering how good these are.
 Works well
 I used this hard Drive for my ps4. It worked for about a year and a half then it crashed
 Great deal for amount of storage. Would recommend getting an SSD to make this even more powerful but it works well for me.
 Perfection!
 Works like a charm for mass storage.
 Does the job, nothing special.
 Great drive, i did however have a small problem having my PC recognize it at first, but finding it in the storage manager and initializing it fixed my issues
 Cheap good storage
 This HDD only lasted me over 1 year, was expecting better.
 This HDD stopped working in less than two days. It was suppose to be a replacement drive. I'll stick with Western Digital HDDs.
 Excellent works
 Would buy again
 Quality product, reasonably priced, fast shipping.
 It's good, but I cannot check how large cache is. It cost few dollars more if you buy at weekend. Portable hard drive is at the same price, another good choice.
 Works perfectly!
 Good.
 nothing to say about barracuda. it's a standard and it's living up to it's name in a new build.
 Great Product!<br/>Fast speeds and good transfer rates. Nothing bad to say about it, just solid reliable performance.
 Great drive. I've had nothing but good luck with Seagate drives. Good quality, good price, 'nuff said...
 Fit perfect and my computer is up and running and the price was great. Thanks
 Excellent AAA +++ great deal
 Item delivered on time. Easy installation.
 Good product<br/>No problems
 Excellent choice to 24/7 device. It's a hit make a product that is needed for people like me who use the Desktop PC 24/7. Excellent perfomance
 Worked perfectly. Not much else to say.
 Hey that’s pretty good! With a quick google search on how to set it up I got all the settings fixed and works great!
 Works as expected
 I ordered two, but have only used one so far... Works great
 As always
 So far so good. I needed a replacement for a dead 750GB hard drive and this fit the bill precisely. I'm starting to worry, however, that all my Seagate drives seem to be dying at least twice as quick as my Western Digital ones. However, the ones that are dying are from a few years ago so hopefully they've fixed the problems by now.<br/><br/>I'm using this drive for normal storage. No gaming or anything of that nature. I will be doing some video work that might stream from it but overall just general storage use and so far it's been excellent in that capacity.
 Arrived the same day, was very easy to install and went right to work as a mirror drive in my RAID array.
 Purchased 4 of these drives and 2 have failed completely in less than 2 months!  Would not recommend purchasing them at all
 Decent brand.
 works fast and good quality
 Working great
 So far I have not been able to get it to work.  I finally had to return it
 1TB hard drive that is great for the money. Purchased this over a WD Blue 1TB because I've heard BarraCuda's are faster. Indeed they are. I didn't do much extensive testing, but this hard drive reads/writes about 15/30/60 secs faster depending on how big of a file I'm copying. I like this a lot. Doesn't get hot. Sleek. Fits well. No problems yet, and no bad sectors. I did put an OS on this, and it booted up fairly fast. Not as fast as my SSD, but definitely serviceable!
 dude what's not to love about 2tb of storage space.  could fit my entire childhood on that bih
 It works what else can I say
 My son loves it
 Amazing and quite!
 Loud hum from unit immediately after installation.  Returned unit and installed an identical replacement.  Works fine, quiet, and good speed for its size.
 It was a good buy but unfortunately I had to return it because of its size, needed me a laptop HDD and not a desktop
 Came quick and no problems.
 Beautiful very fast
 Perfect amount of extra space for my games and videos.
 Arrived in good condition and working fine in my DROBOs 5D3
 Great product as described in every way
 Workimg great!
 Got this the other day after running out of.space on the other one. I do not regret my decision. There's not much to say about a hard drive but that it came as the description said it would.
 Works like it should
 Super useful with some cables additional works great, also needs to be installed into the pc for recognition.
 I will not be purchasing another seagate drive, I lost all of my data abruptly after a year of using this drive.
 Out of the box only 10 minutes and its going back!!<br/><br/>It failed to rewrite 4 time no more Seagate , WD only for now on.
 Works great.
 Very good
 Works great.
 It worked perfectly and is storing all my heavy games.
 Great drive, fast and works right out of the box.
 A LOT OF STORAGE FOR THE MONEY
 I mean... what can I say? Works as expected, easy to install (Common, its a harddrive) very good quality, seems fast compared to some older drives
 great performance
 No issues at this time..
 THIN COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS HDD I HAD. FITTED NICELY ON. A TIGHT AREA ON MY TOWER. USING IT FOR VIDEO AND DOCUMENT STORAGE.
 In use now...No problems
 The product is very quiet.
 reat replacememt
 Two drives dead on arrival...
 Works well in my NAS unit.
 Upgrade several hdd to this one. Used for additional storage. (4 HDD to 1 HDD).
 great value
 Works perfectly
 Great drive with lots of capacity!
 it's a little noisy, but I love the extra space for the price!!
 This item was recommeded to me by my tech guy at work. I received it, he installed it and it is working fine.
 fast.....
 Very good
 as i wish
 Good product
 Thank you
 Exactly what I was looking for.
 pleanty of room
 Good for a hdd till ssd prices come down some
 Works great
 Excelente
 Very fast
 Item with exactly as it was described. It worked perfectly.
 Not even a 6 month window and it failed, making seriously bad noises and there was a lot of important data on there.
 Works great but it does not come with Sata cable I had to order and wait for it to arrive.
 Works as described
 Has not failed yet, though it did have/still has a windup that makes me grit my teeth. Other than that, it's an exceptional drive
 NO COMPRE ESTE ARTICULO Y ME HICIERON UN COBRO Y LA COMPAÑIA QUIERE QUE DEVUELVA EL OBJETO PERO YO NO LO COMPRE
 Works fine, replaced dying hard disk drive in my desktop PC.  Good price, like Seagate quality.
 Easy to install.
 Installed, formatted, and recognized by my pc with no problems. I only hope it can keep on working.
 Good cheap storage, definitely get 2 tb or a 250 gb ssd alongside it
 It has 4TB and smells like blueberry muffins... What more needs to be said.
 Enough storage for a good amount of games &amp; photo + video.
 The new 256 MB Cache seems to make it Very responsive. I really enjoy it.
 Excellent
 works great and fast
 Service was great delivery with right on time the hard drive I could not be happier with it is freaking awesome no more waiting for game to download no more waiting for updates it takes 2 minutes max for everything it's awesome I recommend it
 I have no major complaints, all I would do diffrent is packaging. Add at least some bubble wrap around it.
 As expected
 Really inexpensive storage.  A solid choice for those with a lot of data to keep track of.
 Quick and quiet
 Good
 Came as described, in good packaging, and in good condition. Others have had problems, but as long as you have the required power and sata cable (not included) you can check the HDD. After you physically install the HDD, format the drive (can use Disk Management application) so you can use it. Then run Crystal Disk Info and Mark to determine if your drive is in order. I got speeds around 200MB/s, which is almost double my WD Blue's speed (although its two years old and 90% full). Also, the storage space will be slightly "off" due to differences in how manufacturers designate a kilobyte = 1000b and it should be 1KB = 1024b. This is standard in industry.<br/><br/>All in all, this drive is fast ,quiet, and cheap. 10/10 at this time, and will update if something changes.<br/><br/>*Bought for about $60 usd, new from amazon on 10/17/2017.
 Part works great. It is exactly as described.
 Cheap extra storage for a budget build.
 works as expected
 It’s not working
 Good
 Can't beat it for the price and speed.
 I placed it in my newly build pc and it started making a grinding noise every time I downloaded something!
 Past several drives I've bought from Seagate, WD, anyone, have been dying at only 3 years.  This is definitely down from 5 or more years MTBF noticed in decades past - making the newer drives pretty much pieces of shyte.  I only bought this P.O.S. because going 2TB SSD is still unjustifiably over $1k.  Quality usually improves over time, as processes get better, understanding improves, workmanship gets tailored ..... unless the companies have abandoned the tech and spirit.  The falling MTBF times show the companies have abandoned spinning magnetic media.  No surprise, but they hide behind their older, better name.
 Worked like a dream does just as it's suppose to aka it added 2Tb to my computer and it's just... wow
 5 months of excellent work, no problem identified.
 Great backup drive, arrived on time and undamaged, tested under various software before usage.
 Easy five stars. Does what it's supposed to do.
 As expected
 Drive worked perfectly for Apple iMac and no thermal issue
 So far works perfect
 Good Buy
 No issues here.
 so good
 excellent the product arrived without any problem
 it works
 is ok
 It worked
 Great for archival storage or for a beginner gaming rig! Worth the money and easy enough to install.
 A+
 Exactly what I needed.
 Great product
 Already in place.  so far so good.
 It failed in less than 2 months and had a bunch of important files in it :(. Will return it to seagate for replacement.
 Good hard drive for the price
 Failure after 5 months.
 Runs good!
 Great for Budget Beginner computer Build
 I have ordered this many times before for my server
 Awesome!
 never disappointed with Seagate. faster than my 2 year old 1TB Firecuda SSHDs and cheaper.
 Works very well, fit right into my hdd slot and no problems 2 months in!
 Utterly fantastic
 Fast for a HDD
 and it only took me 4 and a half months to get it properly setup
 Its fast and slim. Great product so far especially for the price.
 Great HDD, works fine with no issues so far
 good
 Hard drive failed after 2 months.
 Worked as advertised. No problems with either the installation nor with the shipping.
 The Dell desktop factory drive got hit by a virus.... upgrated from 1TB to this 2TB and made anti-virus a non-negotiable MUST. Love the drive... its much and noticeable faster than the factory one. TYVM
 From the first connection, it only emits 2 beeps and does not connect.
 Prefect fit for my needs
 Started having issues after a few months and then completely failed before half a year has passed.
 Received a defective unit!!! Avoid at all costs...
 I hear others receive DOA Seagate drives and just cannot understand. I've been in the I.T. sector for 25+ years and have consistently purchased Seagate HDD's and I have yet to receive a DOA drive! Seagate HDD's ROCK and are unparalleled to any other manufacturer and these new line of BarraCuda drives are no exception! I purchased 3 of these drives and they've been up and running 24/7 since the day I got them, not a single problem with these drives - PERIOD!
 After used up 1.5TB of 2.7TB.... Read and Write will be slower then expected..
 I installed into my gaming PC for mass storage a few months ago. The drive has worked perfectly.
 No instructions
 So Far so Good...Quiet drive and doesn't run Hot....Only reason for 4 Stars is its only been 3 days
 Works!
 So much space!
 Perfect!<br/><br/>-D.M.
 Load's faster than Toshiba hard drives
 I have ordered several of these now and the price is right and works great
 It works right off the bat on my Xubuntu desktop. The added storage was great for the price. I used it to store data for home computing and it doesn't feel slow at all. I don't store programs on it and for that this is just what the doctor ordered.
 Great little drive for what is needed. Ease of use and set up.
 Product didnt work very unhappy. Easy to install but didnt make it to my destination unharm.
 Best hard drive for the $/storage ratio.
 great value
 It works, as advertised. Enough said
 Ordered 2, first one made obnoxious crackling sound. got a replacement, same thing. Never getting another Seagate.
 easy repair for my laptop
 Out of 5 Drives for a home NAS, 2 would not work.  1 was just DOA and the second would not initialize.
 Finally lots of storage! Love it! Very fast
 Buena velocidad y gran desempeño
 I have purchased a lot of hard drives in my days and so far this has been a great drive, very fast &amp; responsive! read / write speed are awesome!!
 Got exactly what I payed for. Works perfectly fine and was easy to install.
 I use it for update my PS4
 Doesn't power on. I used the same cables as the ones I use for my existing HDD and nothing happens. It doesn't make any noise nor does it register in my BIOS.
 Great drive everything you would expect from reputable brand
 The R/W speeds were a pleasant surprise.
 Excellent product easy to install and initialize!
 SEAGATE IS SERIOUS HIGH QUALITY BRAND, AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN THEIR DRIVES, I WOULD CERTAINLY BUY ANOTHER SEAGATE DRIVE WHEN THAT TIME COMES
 working good
 Performs well, good price, quiet running. I would buy agian and do recommend it.
 awesome!
 i use this for movies and tv shows its plenty for that
 Excellent drive-used for backup and photos.
 It's exactly as advertised. Works well, isn't loud, and hasn't broken.<br/><br/>In my terms, that deserves 5 stars.
 They cost soo much but dnt work when you get them its ashamed...waste of money
 Excellent.
 lots of storage for the price.
 Fast and good product!, I'm glad I chose this hard drive
 New, clean, works as expected.
 Stopped working after about a week, disk no longer spins and all of my data is lost. I'm returning for a full refund and will not be purchasing a Seagate again.
 no problems
 Works well to store my games on my new pc!
 Great price, you cannot go wrong with it!
 Hard drive does exactly what I expected.
 Good
 Works great!
 I like the actual space and it’s really easy to install
 Item arrived on time in perfect condition. It's working perfectly fine with no flaws.
 Its not a ssd, but games still open at a good speed.
 Min is failing after only 6 months, Need to buy a new HDD soon...
 Its an hdd whats to say.
 Works great
 used to replace a drive in a 10 year old server RAID. Went in, works without an issue. Have been running it for over a month and half now without any issues!
 does what it's supposed to do, boots up windows in 6 seconds
 Good hard drive.  Installed in a very demanding server and so far has keep up with  demand
 Amazing, works perfectly as intended and looks very professional. I recommend it!
 Reliable
 I mean, 2tbs at a affordable price that works for both pc and console, Do i need to explain further?
 DOA. Clicking noise. Failed SMART
 Great
 it's a hard drive. with a non-competitive price, it's really a toss up between this and western digital.
 Works well. I use it as Time Machine drive for my hackintosh. No problems so far.
 It works great. Computer is loading and running programs at a good speed. For the price this suckers at it’s a good buy.
 50% of the drives I purchased failed within 5 months.
 Good cheap storage
 Does just what it needs to and doesn't give me any fits. Can't complain about that!
 as advertised, great hard drive for storage
 Awesome amount of storage!
 excellent product.
 Worked great for 4 months then died outside the return window.  Honestly wasn't a big deal since I was simply using it to store extra games.  But It still sucks to be out of $70...
 Very quiet. No problems.
 I have been using this hard drive for two months now. I am using it as a data hard drive for my games, pictures, and videos. The particular hard drive I got only works half of the time. When it is not working properly, it has insane response times (1000-4000ms) and insanely slow read and write speeds (4-12kb/s). Yes kilobytes. Seems to be about 1000 times slower than what it should be. I have to restart my PC every time this hard drive starts acting up just to get normal speeds again. And that is not even a guarantee that it will work. Sometimes it requires two successive restarts. I end up restarting my PC at least once a day because of this. I have let this hard drive try to open a video game for 30 minutes straight and it still couldn't load everything. But when it works, it works well and is quick. But its just a matter of time before I need to restart again. This is the second Seagate hard drive I have purchased, both of them defective. The first one I just sent back and got a Samsung SSD instead.
 Works great it’s fast
 Works
 HDD failure fixed. Seems to be working great.
 Very nice
 Upgrade to my laptop
 Seagate is very reliable through the years.
 Works great. I have no issues with it.
 High quality product, the HDD exceeded my expectations. 100% recommendable!
 It's recording as stated!
 Was excellent upgrade choice to replace my old 2TB HD that quit working in my HP desktop.
 ok
 very fast SSD, a lot of storage
 Installed and is working as expected, great packing and was delivered on time.
 Easy to install.
 Easy to install, great price!
 My son purchased, built his computer himself.  he really likes it.
 works great
 Excellent.  Thank you!!!
 EXCELLENT,!!
 Good hard drive
 Does its job, good price!
 Hubby loved it.
 We purchased one and it worked for only 4 months. very disappointing.
 Vary nice, fast and quiet.
 It does what it's supposed to do....
 Bought used first and that one gave me issues, got one new and it worked perfectly!
 gaming pc
 Came in a day early. Hard drive runs wells with no problems. Would recommend to anyone who needs a new HDD.
 This is now the second 4TB drive that has come DOA and the replacement is dead too.<br/>Why amazon why?
 4 out of five this drive gets a little hot other than that works great.
 best hard drive i have ever used
 No problems
 It has been a little over a year and I now have to replace it. Not sure what happened.
 great as always
 good
 I love how it looks. It was super easy to install.
 goood
 Huge drive. Great price. It's a hard drive.. Store your junk on it! Easy install.
 Great price, good fast drive.
 So far so good.
 Came super fast and was carefully packaged. Works too; zero complaints.
 Works great!
 Quiet, reasonable price for a desktop HDD.
 Good space for a great price
 Its great
 If you are looking for a hard drive that has adequate or higher performance, DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE<br/><br/>1. This drive’s R/W speed is really bad (approx. writing 60+MB/s for large image files in my case). It is actually a 5400/5900-rpm drive, not 7200rpm one claimed by the description page. You can search the model number on Google and verify by yourself.<br/><br/>2. The way Seagate hides the rotation speed specs really disgusts me. This is partially the reason the information here is misleading. I really hate this kind of company policy (not revealing important specs) that treats customers like idiots.<br/><br/>At least for me, no more Seagate drives.
 Works!
 just what I needed--sooner than I thought I would need it.  quick delivery. good price.
 Works great. So quiet that when I first turned it on I kept putting my hand in the case to feel it vibrate because I couldn't believe it was spinning.
 Came dead on arrival
 I used it replace a failed hard drive and the system recognized it without any problem.  Windows 7 Pro 64-bit installed with no issues.  Then again, I have used Seagates before, so I didn't expect any issues.
 Excellent hard drive
 Great Deal!
 Perfect!
 Good drive
 Excellent HDD, just what I expected. If you are looking for a new HD and you have a low budget this is your deal!
 Great product, great price, quick delivery
 Works great for my husband's gaming set up
 awesome
 It works. Couldn’t ask for more.
 Great system for a great price.
 Came in faulty and bugged, did not work even when taken to a shop.
 This drive gives you ample storage space for a very reasonable price...
 I've had it for almost two months now and I've had no problems.
 Very Good AAA+++
 Grandson loves it
 Moved everything to this drive and I still have space!
 Worked perfectly
 Very nice... Worth the money...

 Great
 Very fast and quiet HD. I installed it for a NAS application an improved speed over my previous hard disks.
 Did not dislike I loved it
 It has functioned as advertised. No issues at all.
 This external hard drive has given me much bigger storage capacity
 Exactly what I expected.
 Exactly as described working great
 Works great, easy install and ready to go
 I have two of these drives. 6TB. Do they work? Yes. Do they work fast on a RAID 0? Yes. Do they fail. Yes.<br/><br/>I had one drive fail after 3 weeks.<br/><br/>They come with the rescue plan1 but Im not sure what that means because SeaGate is still trying to charge me $1,500 for data recovery.<br/><br/>(Yes, I have a back up but I swapped my back up to a new server and in the middle of transferring everything to the back up again, the drive failed.)<br/><br/>I have not received my RAID 0 back yet to see if everything is truly ok, some people have reported lots of corrupt files upon return. I have a small server with 4 WD NAS drives in it and I've never had a single problem.<br/><br/>Stay far away form these drives. FAR AWAY!
 Drive failed after 6 months.
 I backed up 150gb Macbook pro ealry 2015 Files in 30-40 minutes. Has some weight to it. It feels premium.
 Solid as always.
 works great.
 It was what my IT guy needed so he told me what to order and he said it worked fine.
 PROS: Reliability; Capacity; Ease of Installation. CONS: Not an SSD. So far the only downside is that the drive is not an SSD, otherwise I only have good things to say about this hard drive. I'm using it as an external storage drive in my Sabrent Hard Drive enclosure (supports drives up to 2-TB). It's actually replacing a 1-TB drive from Seagate, therefore I expect its reliability to be excellent. The drive was easy to install as all I needed to do was drop it into the enclosure, attach it to my computer via the USB port, and format it using the disk management program in Windows 10 (also in most other versions of Windows OS). NOTE: Since the drive is 2-TB or less, it's formatted using MPT.
 Havent had a problem
 Pretty simple, order and you shall receive. Works fine so far. :)
 Amazing
 This hard dive was a little difficult to reprogram into my os4 but once I got it it’s been working great:)
 Quick delivery.  Product as expected.
 Appears to work as intended. No issues since purchase.
 Perfect!  Will be buying more in the future.
 very helpful and good item
 After 32 days of use,  it failed.  The sad part is that for only 2 days  I lost the opportunity to return it.  This is the first time I had a hard drive that fails in a short amount of time.  I am surprise about the quality of this particular drive.  Not recommended if you're planning to have important information in it.
 Failed upon install.
 Real good.
 so far so good
 Built a computer
 Quick and easy to install and the price was far better than I expected. Top notch!
 working great so far!!<br/>Not a gamer, just office work
 It does what it's supposed to and is reasonably priced
 Very easy to install and use.
 As advertised.  Flawless
 First one didn't work but I think it was because of my Bios. If it doesn't work for you, update your bios.
 Works
 Works just fine.
 Needed more space.Both Hdd's passed all tests, and I proceeded to fill them up.
 Bought it for storage. Works just fine.
 Good product!
 It works great and it's good for its price
 Great price! Works great!

 Good stuff and great value. I got two of these!
 Works great, clean fit in the casing, lots of storage and easy to install, first time installing hardware.
 Item as described. Fast shipping. Recommend.
 Good choice
 excelente
 Great value, great read and write speeds, not to mention the amount of storage per dollar you get is some of the best I have ever seen. A great buy for an upgrade or new build.
 Wasn't 1 TB, it is 850 gb, is there a way I can turn it to its full potential or do I have to return it and get another one??
 Delivered a defective product.
 Quick and easy, product worked perfectly
 great
 Very very loud but does it's job

 Works great
 Havent had one crash on me for 2 years already.
 Beautiful
 Fairly quiet hdd
 Not sure what to say, I just wanted to give it a 5 star review.
 its a working hard drive. no issues.
 exelente!!!
 2TB of storage with no issues thus far. These drives hold data just fine with their size and I haven't noticed any issues with reading information. I use the drives to store my games and files, with both seeming to have no issues in retrieving whatever is needed with decent speed. I'd recommend using an SSD for your OS and one of these for your files and programs.
 Great fast
 Works great so far
 Great item. Easy to install. I would buy again.
 Works like a charm would recommend
 Excelente disco duro
 I like the specs for this HDD as is.

 Good drive for the price. Hope it lasts

 An excellent replacement internal hard drive that runs 7200 rpm and has a 5 year warranty!
 Thank you!
 hdd air flow temp failed
 Just what I needed
 Like others have reported, the first unit I received seemed to work properly read/write wise, but suffered from a whine/buzz/vibration that would start when the drive went idle immediately after a read/write operation. This noise/vibration would continue for a number of minutes until finally the drive seemingly entered some other idle/sleep state (platters still spinning in all instances). Pressing on the top of the drive with an open palm would dampen the vibration such that the noise would all but disappear, but this obviously wasn't a long term fix. This noise/vibration was especially noticeable given that the drive was installed in an external USB 3.1 Gen 2 enclosure. It's possible that had this drive been inside a desktop chassis I might not have noticed the noise, but given how pronounced it was I am willing to bet I'd notice it there too. I called Seagate support and they said this was not normal and sent me an advanced replacement. The replacement unit does not suffer from the offending noise/vibration. I was planning on ordering more of this drive, but now I am not sure if I want to risk the hassle, especially if Amazon has a large number of units in stock from a bad batch.
 Excelente producto.
 love it add's so much more to my cp
 It works
 Meet all my expectations ,works well and I would like to note the delivery it was fast and ahead of schedule actually .very pleased .
 2TB HDD and it works. Get it
 It does not work on the ps4 slim
 OK was a bigger size than expected
 perfect and working good so far, and really faster than older editions with speed of 5200
 Excellent
 So far so good. It's quiet, fast, and has a lot of space. I will update if anything goes wrong.
 great hdd. bought 3
 the products is very good quality. I bought it for $80 to expand my storage and i am happy with it so far.
 as expected, easy to install, reasonable price
 Seagate plays well with others - unlike WD
 Works fine.. reinstalled windows 10 and no issues so far
 Ordered this to replace the Western Digital Blue 2TB drive that was horribly loud at all times (loud buzzing noise).  This is silent but deadly.  Installed easy, works great and is silent.  Boom.
 Didnt work.
 Nice drive
 Excellant product works with both Windows and Ubuntu
 Installed easily and no issues so far.
 Works great and easy install
 Good drive so far!
 Arrived on time and as advertised.
 pair this with a 50$ SSD, and an amazing combo
 Great hard drive very fast loading times.
 Very good hardrive all that and some aaaa++++
 Exactly as described works great!!
 As needed
 72 hours after installation/restore hdd screamed click, click click of death. Reformatting and attempted reload failed, naturally.<br/>EPIC FAIL FROM THIS SUPPLIER ! CLEARLY THIS WAS A REFURBISHED DRIVE!  EXCEPTIONALLY DISAPPOINTED!! If you've ever replaced a hdd in an old imac you know it is considerably more involved than opening an access door and popping out the old and in with the new in 5 seconds. More like an hour AND MY TIME IS OH, SO MUCH MORE VALUABLE THAN DEALING WITH THIS CRAP.
 It is not as fast as SSD's but it is fast and for cheap price.
 love it
 Excellent!  Worked as expected!
 Love the product.  Just wished my DVR was great as harddrive...
 great product, fast delivery
 Works great and ships fast
 Good
 It is noticeably slower than my WD Black. I expected it to be faster, but I get around 113/113 R/W on this hard drive while I get around 180/150 R/W on my WD Caviar Black (1TB). It makes for a good storage drive, so I installed Linux on the WD and kept this drive as a cross-OS storage drive and it works well. I was hesitant to get Seagate, and I haven't purchased one in over a decade but seems just fine. I am extremely careful with my drives, so I will definitely update this if it fails. I have had my WD for going on 5 years probably. So, that is my standard for this one for now.
 Didn't last 3 months!! I used this as my add on to the Nyko Data Bank and began to use it for my PS4. Within 3 months this failed and now a prompt comes up on the screen that a reinstall needs to be uploaded from Playstation.com......... When I try to do so it says that the update cannot be used. It's very frustrating and now I have to start over to look for a new hard drive. I've tried to reinstall and even an update with no luck. UGH!!!!!
 Good Product.
 the drive would only format to 2tbs. Either it was defective or mislabeled.
 Dead on arrival
 All working fine. Extra 2TB storage feels good
 Excellent~
 Very good
 Worth it
 Great product, great price
 Easy to install. Just a little thicker than my old one but fit great  It works great
 Hard to beat this price, esp with Prime shipping.  I've never had an issue with a Seagate drive and didn't expect any with this one.  My plan was to substitute this higher capacity drive for a smaller backup drive to get more frequent system backups.  Mechanically, every thing went smoothly, even using the same cables.  However, my newer WIN7 64bit system was schizophrenic about recognizing the new drive.  I finally figured out (to the Google!) that drives over 2TB require a special formatting in WIN7 systems.  Once this formatting was done every thing was great.
 Bought 4 of these to upgrade my ReadyNAS from 4x1TB to 4x2TB.  First 3 works great after doing in-place RAID5 add/expand.  The 4th one failed with hundreds of thousands SMART errors during formatting.  Luckily Amazon is great at replacing defective product.  Other than the inconvenience (and early drive death, hence 4 stars), I am satisfied with these drives.<br/><br/>Performance is slightly faster than my old Hitachi 1TB drives.  The larger cache helps as I have my NAS set to sleep after 15min of no activities, and they spin up to use faster with the cache.
 Great for any type of build , no issues at all .
 Lightweight and plenty of room..
 Great!!
 not bad
