Odd Device
Yes, you need this upgrade
Love the bigger screen, but not the change to Alexa voice volume control (Edited 10/19/18 - voice issue fixed!)
An Inccemental Improvement Over The First Generation - 7 Things You Should Know - Updated Review
Very glad I waited for the 2nd generation
Can't see the time from a few feet away....
Home Screen ANNOYING x 1000
An improvement, but not without some quirks.
Stop senseless updates.  I lose more than I gain on most of them.
Rethink this purchase...
Amazon added 3 huge Features
Save your money
The good and the bad (but not that bad).
About as much functionality as an Echo Dot with a Screen...
WARNING - (STILL) DO NOT BUY!!! (update 2)
So much potential... but completely uncustomizable.
I nice-to-have item, but it needs more work
Don't buy this for an elderly person unless they have a cellphone
Definite improvement, some software issues on release
Rear speakers are a miss
The Echo Show 2nd Generation Is Amazing
Alexa is living in a box - mixed bag for upgraders
Dont bother buying
Nice product, but the interface isn't there quite yet.
Need clock face support for across the room readability
What it does it does well, but it’s limited in what it can do
Mouth-watering recipes in brilliant color and relaxing videos and sound to soothe the soul too!
I don’t want to return it but I
Fine, not great
Faulty Video on Echo 2nd Gen black and white with lines during calls.
UPDATED:  Great upgrade to v1 but with caveats about how to set brightness settings for bedside use.
Not worth the upgrade
Requires a smart phone to setup video messaging
Not worth it
Surprisingly good!
Love the New Look
So far we love the echo shows
Quirks make it an insufficient sous chef and kitchen TV
Cannot turn off "Try" notifications on home screen
Awesome Smart Display
Loyal customer enraged by product the doesn’t work (hyperbolic but true)
I love them!
NEED A SMART PHONE TO HOOK UP CONTACTS Amazon please address this
Presumptive and somewhat Infuriating device
A Great Upgrade From the 1st Gen Echo Show
OH my GOSH!!
PRETTY FANTASTIC DEVICE LOVE IT!!
Great but very disappointed
Useless device....
Amazing.
Hey Get a new echo and watch it stay on the ECHO screen
Pretty Good Product
very irritating and very much a problem
Nice upgrade but Bluetooth connection sucks
Could’ve been a great product
A big improvment in every way
Great speaker, great smart display.
Built in hub
Wonderful Update to Prior Model
Waste of money !!!
Smart Phone REQUIRED for Grand Pa
This new Alexa Show 2.0 DOES NOT have all the features the old one does...
Waste of money
Nice but with exceptions.
Sound is great but that's about it
Glad I got it on sale, I'm disappointed.
Meh...
Great display, great sound quality, pretty mediocre software / features
Completely Incompetent for Anything But The Most Basic Inquiries
Nice smart display with some bugs to shake out
Worth the Upgrade from 1st Gen
Good with even better potential...
*UPDATED* Great sound and great for those with elderly parents or distant relatives
The user account situation is completely broken
Issues issues issues
No skype or other video calling?
Does Not Show Caller ID or Caller name on the Screen
everyone loves it
Could be so much better
No American Support
Mediocre echo device for what I wanted
Doesn't play well with Pandora. I have had to do numerous factory resets!
Home screen not customizable.
Great Concept Needs Software Update
It's alright
No bad but it is missing some features.
The potential for greatness is there.
Not what I expected
Terrible!!!
We caved. First Alexa specific product. Love it!
We love the 2nd Generatiion Echo Show.
Worthy upgrade from Version 1
Not yet ready.
Streaming video calls surprisingly mediocre
What are you really going to use this for?
It's just ok
Great upgrade and worth the price
Great sound, useful for the home
Amazing sound - BUT - Lacks basic touchscreen support and software functionality.
Two steps forward and one step back...
Lacks good support for video streaming
Not nearly as useful after Amazon hobbled Amazon Music
Best Echo Device I Have
Ring and Show are out in space
Setup not done on App
Pictures will NOT rotate in the background
Waited for the 2nd Gen
I don't get it - it's a beautiful brick.
NOT IMPRESSED
I love the new Echo Show!
Well...
Media Player, Security center, and Timer/Alarm in 1 small package
Not an ideal kitchen tool
Awful device, pure frustration
Great but can’t use multiple devices with spotify
This is true love! It’s not urban legend it really does exist and I found it!
Love the screen size and sound!
Frustrating Interface
Best Echo Show thus far!
Definitely buying a 2nd Echo Show 2 in the near future!
Simple and Awesome
Still needs some work, but good
A quick review
Quilty product, sturdily-made
Screen Brightness Not Good
Easiest of Echo Devices
Something is missing for the price
Newest edition is Awesome
A great start but not perfect
Great Improvement!
Echo Show and Ring - Home Automation at it's best. Perfect for elderly parents.
I Got It, Amazon: Echo Has a Ton of Skills to Try
Handy &amp; Easy to Use...BUT No Battery
Poor picture  quality , not a full HD
It's great as long as it's working properly
May revise my rating to higher as time goes on
I’M BLOWN AWAY!
ALMOST Perfect
Not all that, Yet
LOVE THIS NEW VERSION
Limited usefulness;  won't surf web
Needs more integrations, cant pair it to another bluetooth device (i.e. speakers)
BIGGER PICTURE/BETTER SOUND
Video screen times out! Other issues.
FANTASTIC!
A worthy generational evolution
Dont get this unless you want an Alexa with pictures..
Find myself constantly telling Alexa how dumb she is.
Lack of setup help is a hinderance
Awesome but lacking!
Just like being married
Continual Hounded by the "Things to Try" and It Can't Be Turned Off
So many uses...
Nice Product... Except for Annoying User Hints
Handy for multiple uses
Bought for the kitchen
NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY. Limitations abound.
Echo Show is My Choice
Better than the 1st Gen
A Welcome Addition to the Family!
Excellent Product!
Echo Show (2nd Gen)
Love it .... but ......
Check in on the family
Extremely buggy; no channel for reporting bugs/feedback
Big screen. Great sound.
Alexa finally works, don’t put it on an extended network
Good upgrade from the Show 1st Gen
WOW. so much bigger and brighter!!
Sounds Great
We're having so much fun
Awesome New Echo Show
Better Than 1st. Gen
Better than all the other Echos combined
Dynamic sound, modern appearance, fast response times
New version is a major upgrade
Excellent Product ... No Major Problems
Best Echo Show Yet
Audio great, screen is constant irritation!
Mixed feelings.
Echo products just keep getting better--The Show is the example
Impressive
This is what the first generation device should have been!
Dead on arrival
Quality build lacking responsiveness and some obvious skills
Couldn't Love it More!
Love!
Love Alexa
Stay away!
We love the easy instant access to weather, music, recipes, and abundance of skills
Reality has set in
Really disappointing! (updated with new information)
Won't play YouTube Videos 2nd Update
just lovin my echo show
Great product with some qualifications
Not user friendly.
Decent quality but has some problems..
It's an Echo...with show!
Best Echo Device Yet
This still needs major updates
Great Device!
Horrible slideshow capabilities!!
Love the whole Echo line. GREAT for the VISUALLY IMPAIRED or INVALID
Very Disappointed
I like it
Misleading re: Direct Hue control
Rotating stand  for echo 2nd Gen.
Pretty useful but I never use it for all It's features
Speakers are MUCH MUCH better in the 2nd Gen Show
Great as a hub, but have to reset it every single day. Ugh!
WOW!  Just amazing
Does not do what it says!
Need more touch screen intefaction
As usual excellent product.
Understand what this is
Before you rock out adjust the bass settings down a bit.
Sound....WOW!!
Big upgrade from first gen model
Great new Show
Amazing if you're Lucky
Lacking features that Generation 1 has
Amazing sound!
Pretty freaky!!!
Alexa Show
Does not work with Hulu or Ring like described.
So far I love it.
Needs internal battery for portability
This device should be called "Things to try".
Much improved over the original Echo Show
Love it!
Happy with my purchase.
So far so good
Much better sound than 1st Gen
Could be so much more than what it is...
Better than previous generation
Great device, odd viewing angle...
Doesn't allow for us to show photos
Sugar's Echo!
Great for Kitchen
Its smarter then you think ...
I'm impressed!
Turning off things to try!!! Still on my screen..
So many options with the show, I’m a tech nerd and I’m still learning.....
GREAT Product !!!
The sound quality of 1 Echo Show is superior to 2 Sonos Play5's.
Not User Friendly
You will love it!!!
Tech gadget must have!
Almost great
Useless user interface
Just as smart, Better sound , Bigger screen.
Doesn't work well with amazon photos
Didn't think I needed it
Great to talk to grandkids.
Great device!
A Huge Improvement.
Best Gift to Self
Echo Show Second edition is awesome and then some.
Love, love, love!
Improved in everything second generation is hands down the way to go!
Exceeds my expectations
Does not connect with android version 4.4.4
Very user unfriendly and way lower tech than the &lt;$50 fire tab.
It's ok but
Easy to use
Great to travel distances when you cant
Inexpensive personal assistant
More uses than you think!
No big thrill
What the ??????
Not impressed
Echo Show -- Alexa works well
Great purchase
reat product!!!
Amazing and incredibly useful
Excellent Price
Alexa’s Voice is spitty/muffled.
No need to upgrade from Dots
Annoying nag on screen Constantly.
great and easy to use
LOVE LOVE LOVE
Awesome Product
A  BIG  Improvement!!
10 times better then previuos echow show.
Premium audio quality like Bose and JBL. Sandstone is beautiful.
A fantastic improvement over old unit.
Dumbest "smart device" ever...
You won’t be disappointed
Great speaker
Echo Show only works with a Smart phone with Alex Communications ap
Same problem as the previous generation Show
Background Slide Show Does Not Work Properly
The Jetson's have arrived in my home
Screen seems like a nice addition but very poorly utilized
Works great, excellent sound and picture
Much wider- nice screen
Not worth it.
SUPER SOUND/SOLID BUILD
Won’t be rebuying
Bigger screen and sound
Sounds great and looks great! Best Alexa device in my house!
Nice gift! Great display
Great Product, love the Show
Unbelievable. Mind blowing. Unbeatable
Outstanding Device

Alexa capabilities are amazing and fun!
Didn't like the Sound
Nice product not intuitive enough to unlock features
Solid product, still needs a lot of improvement in functionality
Greater clarity
Awesome addition to the Kitchen
I love my Echo Show
I like the second generation improvements.

Good sound. Cannot stream apart from YouTube or Prime
The best of everything!
Great addition to Alexa setup

I'm a fan
Sound shoots out the back, not much in front
Helpful and entertaining
Absolutely love it!
Definitely my New Favorite Alexa Device
Do it.
You gotta get one of these!!!
Alexa goes visual!
Sit back and feel the new Echo Show!
Surprised how much the sound has improved!
Disappointing Defective and Expensive Product
Takes a while to figure out how to use it. Alexa helps you along the wat!
A nice upgrade from echo show 1st gen
Works Great!
It will enhance your life in many ways!!
Glad I upgraded
