it's good, but.. Night Owls should just skip fitbit products.
I loved it at first until it went to perform a ...
Kudos to Fitbit on the new Versa! This is the fitness focused watch to get at a fair price!
Lightweight
Great! Then it broke üëé
Glad I purchased this over an Apple watch
... this for a week now and can‚Äôt say enough good things about it
Looks and feels awesome, data is terribly inaccurate.
Not impressed...
Five Stars
Nice upgrade from Blaze
Can't recommend this product
I love this watch so much
I love this watch
Light and simple; but that's about the only thing it has going for it.
Love the large screen
Don't use for swimming!
Bluetooth syncing issues still not resolved.
Broke 1st time in water - poor customer service
It's Great!
THE FITBIT VERSA IS A PIECe
DOES NOT WORK WITH ANDROID. Not reliable; disappointed
I thought that I would love my first Fitbit Versa Special Edition
1 Star for device. 0 stars customer service
Unrivaled heart rate monitor
Worse $240 purchase and even worse customer service from Fitbit ...
Upgraded from the charge 2 I am really happy with this watch so far
... the Fitbit Versa for a month now and I loved it for the first week then I noticed a ...
Having some major app issues!
So many problems
Returning it, Very disappointed
Service is as bad as the watch
Screen won't come back on
Battery life is terrible after a few months.
Stopped working after a month
Wanted the Versa to work SO BADLY but for this tattooed chick, it did not
A better option than Polar's M430
Great watch but the NFC "Fitbit Pay" is a joke.
Won't SYNC, TERRIBLE customer service via FITBIT
No longer happy about this purchase
Bad product that Fitbit doesn‚Äôt want to support
Did Not Last Long
Perfect combo of design and function
Cute but Unreliable. A Huge Fail.
No more Fitbits.  Ever.
Fitting a Bit More - Wearer 70+
Maybe next time
Extremely disappointing
Save your money.
Infuriating
Recommended for: Regular people who want to take care ...
Great fitbit, bad material for band
... finally to have saved enough money to get a smart watch that I can sync with my fitness app
It‚Äôs great if the screen didn‚Äôt break so easily - very dissatisfied
Don't Do It!
Wait a little longer for all the glitches to be fixed/worked out...
best fit bit so far but still not reliable
Way better than the Alta HR.
Will not update to latest firmware
DO NOT BUY!
Constomer Service should be number on yet they made me feel like I didn't matter!
So Many Missing Features!
It was what I was looking for and what I needed
Crack in screen after normal usage
Do not buy‚Äîhorrible customer service‚Äîcan‚Äôt fix issues with app
this is the best fitbit I've owned and I definitely recommend it
Hasn't Lived Up to the Hype
If you drive a lot do not purchase this!
Heart Rate Monitor will NOT work on Dark Tattoos!!
Fitbit Versa is causing me migraines and auras
Love the new Versa.
Consistently unreliable connectivity. I regret purchasing this.  Avoid.
Horrible Android app - sync fails constantly
Without GPS, Data is Inaccurate

Love Fitbit products
Fitbit Versa ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•
Nice watch and good support
I wanted to like this "smartwatch" as I purchased it as an upgrade ...
Great Smartwatch with few drawbacks
A better Blaze, a strong rival to the Apple Watch.
Almost very happy - UPDATE - Not happy
Too many Problems with syncing
Does everything Apple can do for half the price
Disappointed
Hard Pass, We Have Warned You.
This watch just doesn't do what it claims to do...don't waste your money.
On my second warranty replacement in four months
The Review From an IPhone 6 owner‚Äôs Perspective
Dissappointed
Inconsistent sync and GPS connection
Absolutely worth buying!!!
Easy to set up and user friendly
So far I love it! Still learning how to use it but ...
Great. Large, Display
So far I love it. I got it when it came out ...
LAVENDER BAND IS NOT FOR EVERYDAY WEAR
Worst Experience ever!!!
Significant Syncing Issues (Frustration!)
Best wrist-read heart rate monitor watch I've found, and usable even while swimming.
So far so good. I'm a little disappointed that fitbit hasn't upgraded ...
Best of both worlds!
My first smart watch/activity tracker
WORST STEP TRACKER EVER!!!!!
Good customer service bad quality control
It's a tool for mindfulness
Lovde it!! Then a year later it didn't hold charge
Very Nice
Great looking at a perfect size
I don't wear watches...
Far worse fitness tracker than the Charge 2
I lost both sure to the poor clasp design
DUD on Arrival
Fitbit warranty is worthless
Fitbit for getting fit
Loving this new fitbit
So far so good!
Debating between Apple Watch and Fitbit Versa? Choose Apple.
Great quality, the charger is also great
Caused 2nd degree BURNS !
Quit after few months, always breaking and never syncs
So much fun, but not without quirks.
Another falsely advertised HUGE waste of your time from Fitbit
Bad sync, bad measuring steps...poor service, terrible software.
It lives up to the hype.
Total garbage. Step and stair counter, sleep tracking, hue. Noting worked the way it should.
It doesn‚Äôt serve basic purpose (Pedometer) of a fitness tracker
This, light, and wonderful battery life
Quit tracking heart rate and sleep after less than 3 months!
Technology far from good
Fitbit Versa giving me a fit!
Waterproof feature failed on me
Cute, nice upgrade from blaze 2
Seems very comparable to the iWatch, with exceptions.
Wont connect internet. Update required before it is even a watch
It won't stay connected
Syncing Manually
Best fitbit tracker and smartwatch yet!
Stopped Working Within 2 Months
My new favorite activity tracker
should have read the warranty better
I had this for 30 days and bumped the screen against a counter top and the screen cracked like an egg shell
It certainly helped me lose weight!
Stopped working after a couple weeks
Watch does not work; watch never worked out-of-the-box.
The smart watch I've been waiting for
It's a beauty!
great watch for its price
So far so good. This one stays on my wrist
Pairing for listening to music
Versa Review? #ShameOnFitbit
Battery life is great, you can get almost a week of use ...
Tracks Well, Syncing Is Inconsistent
Ok for light use and perfect for Android. Does not work well for apple iphone
Function issues.
Pretty awesome except for a few things
Fitbit does not hold true to Warranty
Love this watch
Cute and Helpful üòä
OK, but a downgrade from apple watch
Fitbit must need more servers, and they definitely need better customer support
Versa
A Great Upgrade From My Blaze
and i love that!
... when the versa came out I bought it and love it. The fit is excellent
Easy setup
Solid purchase
A good step up from the charge but it still needs work.
So far, so good . . .
Great fitness device for the price. Not a smartwatch. Battery life is getting worse by the day
Do not take it into any water...
Love it!
Excellent heart rate monitor
7 months in and completely useless
CHECK PHONE COMPATIBILITY. MOTOROLA USERS BEWARE!!!
Great buy! Love this Fitbit Versa
Legal False Adverizing. No Sleep Stages. They admit they have, ‚Äúa bug.‚Äù Bug is 3 years old.
Happy with Versa Fitbit
Might not work for you
Great Workout app and costs much less than the Apple watch
The product gives my wrist a foul oder and Bluetooth is buggy.

faulty battery & customer service case process
Best marriage of a fitness tracker and a smartwatch!
Second one and it‚Äôs dead after 3 months!! üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº
So glad I bought it! BUT
Pricey but worth it
So many negatives :(
Just meh/ok. Not awed by it
Happy I chose this over the Apple Watch! Definitely recommend!
Great watch for notifications
My First Smartwatch!
Software might not be ready for prime time - but improved in the last year
Poor connectivities to the phone, misses notification.
Watch broke in half.
Just Perfect!!
I wore the Apple Watch for a little over a month and hated the health aspect of it
Battery life has never lasted more than 10 hours
I think I love this smart watch
Perfect gift
6 months and broken
Screen is very fragile and may crack anytime , not covered and no repair centers available
More reliable than Apple Watch
Best investment ever!
Still has syncing issues with Adroid
Another great product by Fitbit
Prefer simplicity of versa over Apple, especially for price
... to get used to but rather than that it‚Äôs awesome all the clock faces and the apps you can ...
I love the Versa!
Charge HR -> Blaze -> Ionic -> Versa
Terrible fitness tracker

A great replacement for my Pebble.
Bugged, Not worth the money or hassel
Great Fitbit Model!
Versa best Fitbit yet!
... bits in the last couple of years and I love my versa

Shouldn't be this difficult to connect.
Bugs are better but women will need a different band
Had multiple issues with my Fitbit Versa
$200 pedometer
Garbage!!!
Good battery life. Inaccurate heart rate function,  and no way to lock the touchscreen
Less than a year and the product isn't working correctly
There are GAMES!
Versa rocks!
Great exercise watch

Easy and precise
Want to give it 5 stars but its sleep tracking is total crap

Great device.... hate band changing!!
Water resistant
Great light weight comfortable, and excellent customer service

Not worth $200
Screen and battery issues

If you like Fitbit you will love this upgrade.

THERE. IS. NO. WAY. TO. PROTECT. THE. GLASS. Hope you like scratches!
Love, love, love
Great new device with potential
Battery (red light) on back of watch will not go off.
Worst running watch - beware
Buyer beware - Stopped working in first 3 months of use
Great tracker completely crippled by terrible software
Choppy Music Playback
Good fitness watch but a bit too pricey for the features it offers.
Avoid if you have Android
Great Fitness Tracker - That's also a Smart Watch
