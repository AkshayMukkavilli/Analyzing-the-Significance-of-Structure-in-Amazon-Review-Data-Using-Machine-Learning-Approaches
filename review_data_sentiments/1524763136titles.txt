Best Bio Ever
Wonderfully done.
Everything I needed to hear
Surprised
On page 389 or so it but me hard. This book was going to end!  The fact of that saddened me more than I was prepared for. Throughout my reading this I felt lifted up , embraced by arms of hope and dignity. I couldn't wait each day to get home from work to continue, but felt the creeping in of sadness knowing , like all great stories, there is a formula that includes an end. Michelle Obama inspires me as no other person I know of.  I will enjoy whatever of the rest of her life becomes revealed, for her intellect, her grace, her compassion, her wit, and mostly her optimism foretells great things to come! I can only say, thank you more than you know for being who you are!
A Good Friend and Hot Tea
Highly recommend for everyone!!!
Adore this Woman!
Michelle was very open about her evolution to becoming a fantastic adult. You go girl!!!

This was the most insightful, inspirational, heartwarming book I have read in a long time.

I would recommend this book to all  people, so they can learn the process of what it takes to "Become".
A most marvelous experience.
