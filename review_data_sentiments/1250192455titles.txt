Definition of Integrity
Ok book.
Not a perfect man, but fortunately a man of conviction
Truth and honesty in our politics must prevail
but prompts me not to like him much
Doing the right thing
Covers a lot of different stories...
Good book, with greasy finger prints
"The core of our nation is our commitment to a set of shared values . . . to restraint and integrity . . . " (p. 276).
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND THOROUGHLY ENLIGHTENING!

Confirmed suspicion of extreme hubris
If you‚Äôre following the 2018 news cycles you will really enjoy this book. Comey comes off as an honest public servant whose penchant for the truth. Trump just blows him away.
