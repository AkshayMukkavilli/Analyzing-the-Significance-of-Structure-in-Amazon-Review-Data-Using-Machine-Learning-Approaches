LOVE THEM!
Ring paid for itself in less than 6 months!!!  [UPDATED October 2018]
Looks great but hidden cost ¨gotcha¨.
Great idea, but very dissapointing customer service.
Reliable security camera...just sometimes a tad slow
Piece of junk
As a camera only, I would give this 5+ stars, easy.
Finally, the bugs are gone mostly...(with updates)
Will not trigger internal chime when hot.
Doesn't work as advertised.
Stays in night mode.
Products will not work.
This is a good product that has the potential to be GREAT
Disappointing Performance
Not a happy camper!
Beware!!! Severe drop in quality
Problems from day 1
Ring Pro - An Expensive Doorbell, Nothing More
Not a good experience
Ring Pro may not be compatible with your doorbell - WHAT?
The odds are this will not work
Seems to work much better with Apple if you like messing with beta tech ...
Sucks!
Died about 40 days out of warranty
OUTSTANDING!
Second unit to fail.
BAD Streaming/TERRIBLE Recording
I tried, I really tried
Not Ready for Prime Time
It is great... when it works............
My video is super choppy. Its not far from my router and ...
in fact it seemed to go very easy. The only problem I have is it doesn't ...
Important: hidden USB port solves power issues
Wait for 3rd generation!
Don't waste your time or money
Must require subscription to see recordings after trial period.  Great customer service.
Video quality is generally bad.  Ring App is mediocre at best.  Too slow/unreliable.
Great Concept, Bad Product
Exceeded My Expectations
Nice Smart Home Device. But some installation gotchas and monthly fees.
Had trouble but finally got it working.
I'm done with Ring. Faulty product and bad support.
Some fears resolved!
Unreliable
Almost good
Not production ready
Frustrating
Known issue and Ring doesn't care
Defective product
Won't stay connected and the company won't let you delete account!
No video. Here's my email back too TELease trying to return.
Keeps failing!
This is a piece of crap. Constantly losing connection
Be prepared for it to not work and Ring to not care.
Worked okay for a couple months, now it's garbage
Really wanted it to happen
Great Idea - Terrible Execution
Product lasted about 16 months then died
Decent
Junk
Inferior to NEST hello, FAILED to record attempted car break-in
Unable to handle the growth
Great idea, but far too slow
I had three expectations when I bought Ring. Much to my surprise none of them were there.
Very impressed
UPDATE - RETURNED FOR REFUND
An incredible waste of time a disappointment
Definitly - Not quite ready
forewarned is forearmed - owners of older homes, beware
Shop around before you buy
Good product after some installation issues.
But it but buy from Costco
I am pretty much in Apple's ecosystem and prefer reliability and centralization ...
great video doorbell
Issues 3 months after use - Horrible Customer Service
Shocked this is still on the market.... or ever made it to market.
Devices work, but no customer service.
Couldn't get it to work
Love/Hate
... provide feedback on a product unless it is very good or very bad
Great device with very poor implementation
Junk Door Bell
Ring was great at first, but now video is really slow.  It's just too expensive not to work reliably as a doorbell.
2 failed units later...
Terrible Product (Performance, Connectivity, Videos, App) - Dont Waste Your Money!
it's ok when it works.
Tech support was super helpful and identified the issue quickly
Beware of "firmware" update 8/12/17
Great Doorbell
Unable to use voice feature
Don't waste your money
Don't expect "Real Time" response. (Like Their Hyped-Up Videos Imply)
Easy Setup, Subscription Required For Optimal Usage
Won’t Power Up
Ring Pro doorbell
Very poor video transmission speeds, if you are lucky!
One Month Use Review
Failing after not even 2 years
Defect issues are common.
Learn from my install issues, have a good internet speed and be aware of subscription
Can't Recommend Enough
Good Doorbell Ringer with a great camera. Fast and responsive
Average video quality BUT amazing customer service!
Great idea, decent software, horribly unreliable hardware, bad customer support
hit or miss: good luck, hope you get all your parts
Tech in progress and support is mediocre
Ring Pro-works well for 1-2 years-then you'll need to replace
Great video, and two-way communication without opening the door is wonderful.
Good buy but may not be compatible with existing wiring!
It seems like it's a software issue
Not worth it! Return it while you can
Couldn't make it work.
New update- Waste of money, reneged on promise, feeling defrauded
Excellent product for door monitoring
You'll probably return it too if you decide to try it.
Overall potentially it’s a winner, but time will tell....
Almost perfect, speaker is a little weak
Never got it to work properly.  Sent it back.
Go with Ring
Horrible customer support
Ring Video Doorbell Pro has been a nightmare
Deceptive claims on performance, save money and get a cheaper unit.
It's crap, don't waist your money!!!!  (Too bad there is not a 1/2 star rating)
I see you looking at my boxes!
Product, Customer Service Excellent
I am on my second Ring Video Doorbell Pro. ...
Great idea but tired of issues. Does ring have any support staff?
Trusting Ring
HAD ISSUES BUT ALL IS GOOD
Fisheye live view - Completely different from their marketing
Overheating issue and fraudulent customer service
Perhaps the best of a mediocre crop of video doorbells...
Intermittent at Best
Dead on Arrival.
the ring pro is an excellent product. The following should be enhanced
Great for 5ghz Wi-Fi, worth the extra money for picture quality
Not compatible with DC powered doorbells
Life expectancy is about 2 years, then you get to buy one again.
Okay Video, Neighborhood Beta Program Outstanding!
So far so good
Ambitious device that falls flat on execution
Performance not as expected/can't be reset remotely  - I would not buy this item again.
VERY UNRELIABLE
Worked pretty well.. for a short while. Now it sucks.
$300 plus doorbell quit working after a couple of months ...
on’t buy. Unreliable
3 months later - completely defective
Great product to make your home security more robust.
If it doesn't work right away, it could be a defective unit
Fun for voyeurism, but falls short on security and integration
Ring all the security you will ever need
Ring is a great idea. I gave it three stars only because ...
Pretty Darn Good / "JUST OK" Video Quality
Great product, but two quite different installation experiences.
I like this doorbell
I updated my score up to a 5 to reward Ring for customer satisfaction!
Easy to use , good for security , installation free
Horrible product. Purchased 2 of these from amazon and ...
I feel like the Alexa device need to ALERT YOU TO SOMeONE ...
Great Product - Highly Recommended
Incredibly easy to install.
Worked great until free video storage was up!
Product simply does not work consistently
Great product, App needs work!
Great for automated home
Keep on looking for a good device
Love my Ring Video Doorbell Pro
Latency is an issue
AWESOME DOORBELL AND SIMPLE TO INSTALL!
Not worth the money.
Works great, I wonder how I lived without it!  -1/2 star for disabling my doorbell.
Rule the porch
Very expensive doorbell
Decent product but overpriced. Might look at Nest.
... difficult for me to write considering how much I loved the device when it worked
Very sensible to power.
Should have read the fine print
Save your time and money
Ring products and service are great
An amazing product!
A Really Nice Piece of Equipment to add to your Home Security.
6/5/18 Update up to 5 stars from First impression 4 out of 5 stars and here is why...
however I have an old house and didn't know how good or powerful the wiring was for my current doorbell
Nice to review events later, but useless for realtime communication. Unreliable and spotty connectivity.
Great product but more importantly great support
The recordings made by the doorbell are brilliant both day and night
I wanted to love this device! Never worked right for me.
A happy new owner
This is one of those device that changes your personal habits.
After Wiring Device It May Take A Few Minutes To Power On
Great video doorbell for all except the surveillance freaks
Be prepared to mess with your wireless network
Ring Pro - Good, but could be better
RING PRO not working reliably?? Here's WHY and WHAT to do to fix it ....
The video doorbell I was hoping for
I will never own a house again without a ring doorbell.
Works well so far
Malfunctions/Terrible customer support.
they're excellent. The build quality of the hardware is excellent
Has issues, but I still like it
I was happy with the product before but now I am elated
Good Product - Could Be Improved
Great product with a few areas for improvement
Almost perfect
I explained that their was a good chance someone would try again because they were almost ...
Broke after a month
Update December 2018
Works Great!
differentiation through service
Security and Comfort from a Doorbell. Who Knew?
Ring cannot provide consistent power supply requirements
Sounds great Just doesn’t work
Device is OK, app is pretty weak and seems to be getting worse.
Great product and better security!
Entire story was not evident
No more ding-dong....
(and the installation was easy as pie
Trouble from the Get Go.
DOES NOT WORK NOT WITH ALEXA. Not impressed, poor video and audio quality, long lag times
We are now in the Ring Gang!
After some hurdles I love this thing
A Strong WiFi Signal is Absolutely Necessary for this Product to Work Correctly
Excellent business, customer service, and product concepts, but product could definitely use some improvements
Nice upgrade from old 1st Gen Ring, but a bit fussy about current
worked for more then a week and then got very glitchy [edited]
I think this is a great product, and surprisingly simple to set up
Installation can be difficult based on the requirements. Not all requirements are specified upfront.
I Tried but finally gave up
worked great until lost wifi signal
Very Useful Product
My wife and I both love this Doorbell
Much better than Skybell HD, still severely lacking as a camera.
Great Video Doorbell, but not perfect.  So 4 and a half stars
Read setup requirements carefully
Great now that they updated echo
Disappointing Performance
I thought it was going to be quick like the original ring
2 Ring Pro's are up and Running for me, I share my notes and ideas for improvement
Your existing door bell and wiring is functional and in good working condition.
Almost made it 2 years (updated)
Functions as an alarm clock if you want to get up at dawn.
Ring is Worth it!
TOO MANY false alarms for cost
Expected more stable product
Does not work. Update.
Bad customer service. Really. Updated: replaced.
Excellent Product - A Security Must Have
BEWARE! NOT AS ADVERTISED! DID NOT WORK FOR ME AT 19VAC
Very happy with the performance and features of the device.
I really wanted it to work. ... :(
I like it for deterrence only but too expensive for only that.
Not sure I would call it "Pro". Maybe Semi-Pro?
Great product. Some hiccups, but customer service is second to none.
So So Disappointing
DOES NOT WORK in cold weather
ought this product. It worked for 18 months and ...
Installation was Issue but Now Works Great!
Not enough technology - Save your money.
Interesting Concept
No issues with the camera, but if you're thinking about picking this up, take a good look at where your ringer is located
Replaced my SkyBell video doorbell with Ring; and Ring works great!
Superb
Up and running, thanks Ashlei O!
yet I am satisfied with the performance
works well if you keep your expectations low
Might have to wait 24 hours before it starts working
Not a Satisfied Customer
Did you get that package?  Now you know
Really bad tech support on a basic installtion question
If it works, it's useful
overrated
Easy setup but stopped working within months and customer support reps are experts in giving the run around
Simple setup and easy instructions but I had to call customer support for firmware update to get out of night view mode
Nice addition to my layered security
installation was fairly easy. Granted that I'm bit handy but i think ...
Initial problem, great customer support
Worth buying the Pro version, but still has some cons.
Excellent Product, would buy again.
Power issues
Maybe someone else
16-vac / 30+a
dead on arrival.  poor technical support to troubleshoot
Very poor app and no free storage
Terrific product
Front Door Safety At Last
Didn't work, switched to SkyBell HD
Worth the price
Wonderful product and service.
Best security device out there - already paid for itself!
Great device until problems begin after a year
Good product, could use a few changes to documentation and service
A fancy, expensive toy
Love the Ring Video Doorbell Pro
Research, Ring has strings attached
Very good doorbell but you have to pay for cloud storage. Skybell is free
Overall happy with this product
Love Love Love
A bit of delay, app needs polish
I can say enough about how much I love this doorbell
Buy from Ring.com!
Ring Video Doorbell Pro
I feel it adds an extra layer of security to our home, protection to my family and our privacy.
Responds really slow. B the time you check it what ever set off the camera is gone.Talking to someone live is impossible.
Cool gadget  with a Deceptive Motive
balky connectivity and poor microphone
One of the worst installation experiences with something as simple as a doorbell
Worst Product I’ve ever bought! Do Not Buy!
They even sent me a special cable to keep the power regulated better, but nope
Very useful, easy to install, can individualize, good video and sound
Thoroughly mediocre. Maybe future generations would be better...
Not dependable!
Three Units Failed, So Far.
Do not get this if you have a covered porch!
13,000 reviews later, and they're still watching.
Unfathomly, unconscionably bad.
Great design, super customer service
Great product and video quality, but.....
Great for package tracking!
TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
I'm disappointed with the overall quality
Love the Ring Doorbell Pro! Works best with Golden Retrievers!
Tiresome Power Issues
A little challenge during installation
Not ready for prime time, unless YOU are already there
Great concept with major shortcomings
Ive installed a NEST and a Rachio sprinkler "smart" controller but i found this product to be the most frustrating of all the smart devices I've bought for my home
It was very easy to install
Video recording first 3 seconds and then video frozen (with sounds)
Sets the Standard for Video Doorbells
Ring Sucks
The doorbell is an amazing piece of work
Not Very Good Support After the Sale
Nice looking product that kinda works and is frustrating to install
Doesn't sense people at night unless 3ft from camera
Keep in mind I installed a new transformer and indoor chime as recommended by Ring Techs
I love this thing
I love this way more than I expected, as do friends and family
Very good tech support!
Peace of Mind at a Glance.
Piece of junk. Do not believe RING when they make the install seem like plug and play.
Excellent System
Promising product, serious flaws.
So far so good. Keep in mind this requires a $30 per ...
this is a great product, and I love having the ability to ...
Return right away if you can't get this to work as Ring support will not be able to help you troubleshoot
Great.. I paid an installer 50
Better than nothing?
stopped working after a week...
Never worked. Pissed me off - REVISION 1/7/2019
Great product, not without design flaws
Good product, unethical manufacturer
Do not buy...expected life is 18 months to 2 years...
Power, wiring, transformer, Best Buy
5 star install; 0 star performance for our house; sent back for refund
Poor Wi-Fi password support
This actually works
BEWARE--3 Red Dots show on doorbell at night to initiate night vision -- too obvious !!
Wouldn't buy this again
Does not work with Spectrum Time Warner ISP "high speed internet"
Good, but the app requires some work
Swapped out old Ring with new Ring Pro
Audio communication garlbed
You will need two separate doorbells if you want front and back door operations
Initial impression: Excellent features + good tech support 24/7
Worthless Installation Instructions
Great addition to our security system!
Very volt/amp hungry devices and very poor RF transceivers
Fails to keep wifi connection! Also check your parts and watch UTube video before you connect!
Ring Pro ... Well designed and engineered and easy to install
Second unit worked great!
Good for the 1st 6 months started having problems, solved
Good product
Great product and great customer service!
Well, I have to say, Instructions couldn't possible ...
Great Customer Service
Night and day better vs Skybell
Works. Cloud storage $30 yr. Needed WIFI booster.
Received two DOA Ring Doorbell Pro units. Poor quality control!!
Best do it yourself for front door security and monitoring.
Finicky technology supported by incredible service
Great Product From A Hopelessly Overwhelmed Company That is having Growing Pains
It's a dud, but thanks Amazon.
I'm continually disappointed by the low quality of untested gear on the ...
Needs more than 16 volts
great product, when it works
Great device that even an inept installer like me can install and program
I like it that it has night vision too
Your existing doorbell most probably won't work with the Ring Pro.
Excellent product
Great doorbell - but find and  check your transformer before purchase
We Love It!!!!!! Simple install....great video quality....quick notifications....brings Peace of Mind.
Easy install, great integration with Alexa and FireTV
First off when it works as expected its quite good. I can clearly view and answer the door ...
Buyer Beware - emerging technology with growing pains galore
a lot of false alerts
Works as advertised, though hard to get fully set up (incl. getting the house bell to still chime)
Frustrated
Every house should have one
The good, the bad, and the ugly
Works Great But Needs At Least 18 Volts
Ring Doorbell Pro
Great Doorbell
Technical support is useless, had to "ask someone" the whole time and ...
Works like a charm
If it doesn't work right away, just wait.
Almost perfect. Install went as expected
Mixed bag. Great if you can get it setup and working but that's not as easy as it might seem. And had to be reset after 36 hours
Works great overall
I like the peace of mind that comes with having a Ring security doorbell!
Suggestions for an improved experience
Does as Advertised but you have to pay for cloud storage if you want to keep your videos.
Not bad, not great.
We really like the doorbell
Very rarely am I impressed with a product like this Ring doorbell Pro.
More trouble than it's worth.
Get the 24V plug-in transformer prior. Install, make sure it’s working, then unplug from outlet. Then hookup wire 2 ring device.
Not Just Door Bell but Ring System Critique in Detail.
From One Star to Five Stars in 24 Volts!
Frustrating problems (with fixes)
Customer service A+
Cool when it works, really inconsistant though
Great doorbell camera and video
(UPDATED 1-30-2017) Check your wiring quality and original doorbell transformer before you begin and all will be good!
Pretty Darn Good, but not Quite Perfect Yet
Transformer / Ring Doorbell Pro works best with computer transformer / adapter
trouble with unit right out of box
Love the Ring Doorbell
Do NOT buy this product...
Ring Doorbell Pro is a must have device for your home!!
Love Ring Doorbell technology, simple, don't like Ring billing requirements to store credit card information.
Great product an awesome customer service .
Baba Booey
Works well, just expensive
Don’t bother, waste of $$$
Awesome video doorbell!
Problem after problem....  Now I have a door bell that doesn't even ring
Good while it lasted.  Went through 2 units and switched to Nest Hello.
Great product, not flawless though......
We got this when it was on sale. Love it!
More involved setup, but almost perfect once ip and running
Dont buy this. Ring support is awful
A fabulous system...but it will likely take a dedicated access point to get the performance
I like my Ring Pro
No speaker volume control on the unit
Sporadic
Headache with the night vision mode during the daylight hours.
Ring technical support is clueless.
Ring Pro
Long Delay Times
Replacement unit works great! 5 stars for Customer Service.
Easy to install. Easy to use.
So far, the Ring Pro is a big failure
AAA apt safety!
Huge Improvement over Ring Video!
ero stars if I could.  Very disappointed
Very frustrating.
What did we do without it..
If you DON'T have 3 Mbps upload or better or don't buy (5 Mbps is better)!
This is a real cool device. It was easy to install
good product
I love my Ring Pro
Hit and miss with this Pro unit.
Goog product by default recording time not sufficient
It works perfectly, and I installed it.
Product is not ready for market place. Not worth for any price in my opinion. I cant believe it does not work especially 2nd gen
Do NOT buy - software problem that RING knows about prevents wifi connection
Rings my bell!
Don't bother - too many issues.
I really want to like this product
Best Doorbell/Security Camera
Ransom wear
Great video; poor 2-way audio
Has inconsistent connection but works good when connected
Nice, but overpriced in my opinion
Nice product but poor app &amp; subscription support
A lot of hangups, but Ring Support does help as much as possible.
Ring Pro setup
HOT HOT HOT
Took 20 hours to power on (yes, I said 20 HOURS). But after it finally turned on,it works great and I like it.
Ring doesn't ring when it gets sunny and hot outside
Great so far!
So far so good.
come to find out their google app isn't that great they delivered it to my neighbor whom returned it ...
Bought this doorbell expecting that it would be HomeKit compatible ...
Great Potential, released to early for market
Door Bell disconnects from your phone if you get too far from the door bell itself.
Replacement camera ran HOT - 140 - 150 degrees and kept losing contact, Ring promised new camera, reneged, then sent a new one
More Functionality Than I Expected.
Excellent product!!
Does not record long enough, miss the guys that robbed me
One small problem (on my end).  Works great now.
Ring does not ring the bell for us.
Love it now, not so at first
Too Much Trouble
Works Great -- Things I learned from installing my Ring Video Doorbell Pro
I like the idea of it but unfortunately its only the ...
Great when it works which isn't that often
Great Product, still waiting for HomeKit
Finally got it to pair with my home WiFi after troubleshooting it for HOURS.
"Ring" has been worth my while
Already caught a thief in less than a month
Great doorbell
Technical support was very nice and they are sending new products
Well, if your world is perfect...GREAT if it was designed for the real world...
Great quality, clear picture
Defective, Failed within 24 Hours, Still waiting on a replacement from Ring. Terrible CS. Awful Experience.
It worked great for about a year, then mostly died.
It works but still needs some more development
Five Stars
Wanted to like it, but it rarely works
Great for monitoring front door area quickly &amp; easily!
Won’t power up
Comes with most everything you need to install it. Installation is simple and straightforward.
Worked great up until the point that I actually needed it
Love the quality of the Ring Pro
This works only if you have smart device near you
I can't rate it low enough...
Really useful.  Software maybe should improve just a little.  Have to pay for recording events
Stuck in night vision
Ring's Ineffective Customer Service On My Issue
Doesn’t work like the commercials!
Works nicely, easy to install
Works as stated!
The LIVE VIEW video does not work flawlessly for me but the measure of security that I've gained makes me still a satisfied cust
bad video quality
Added sense of security
Lots to love about Ring Pro!
Buyer Beware
Attentive, but horrifically slow customer support, hoping my second device works
I can recommend. But test your voltage first!
Bought ring pro from this seller. After a couple ...
For me, Ring fails on every promise.
Not a quick installation but eventually works.
This product took a bit to install. On top ...
Did I make a mistake?
Poor smart home support
Excellent product
3 Stars for Install - 4 Stars for functionality (Well designed technology)
Clear, detailed instructions make installation &amp; setup a breeze
Minus three stars for lag between actual event and ability to answer event is a killer
What a bargain! Treasure Truck strikes!
Nice product but more difficult than expected to install
Having great difficulties getting this product to work
Easy installation and quality is great
Great video doorbell
Great product a must buy
Fantastic buy, loved it and slightly obsessed
One of my favorite things
Mostly Great!
I bought 2 poor product and neither works One worked for 4 hours ...
this product offers great promises but does not work
It works well.
Excellent video doorbell! Looking forward to upcoming HomeKit support.
Didn’t work for me
Great product, but expect startup issues
Good but not great!
Costumer service is great. They tried very hard to fix the problems ...
Getting better by the minute!
hidden costs, so beware!
Ordered two for front and back. First one required ...
Unable to power up
Yes, I love it and recommend it!
Defective unit and I am not alone
Terrible product!  Don't buy it!
Great picture and easy to use
Two defective units - would not broadcast Ring wifi signal.
Ring Pro is great, but check your power supply!!!
Could be better, but not bad at all.....
Its kinda cool but...
Live View and Recorded Video Incredibly Unreliable
2 way communication not so much.
Recording time and motion sensitivity need to be addressed.
So far I have had a great experience. Installation was easy.
Love the ring pro for so many reasons!
Easy to install and works great!
Great Customer Service
Check your doorbell transformer voltage before purchasing this product
Highly Recommend!!
Night alerts were useless since by the time the video statmrted recording the ...
Easy Set-up, Quality Product
Great security door bell
Does not work
Highly recommend
The app leaves a lot to be desired
Amazing
... about 6 weeks and I do think it's a great idea. I gave it 4 out of 5 ...
Love the idea of the product, is just a headache getting it to work!!!
Excellent Purchase
Really good support for installation
2 doorbells, neither worked
Works Great and Easy to Install!
Better than Ring Video Doorbell
Love the Ring Video Doorbell Pro, it could use a few updates, and it had a few problems at 1st, but working great now!
Best Doorbell!
What a relief!
Amazing customer service, Great product.
Happy with my purchase of the Ring pro
Completely died in less than one year !  Update: Got back my satisfaction level due to a very good support team!
Ring pro
Awesome when it works, but first order was DOA.
Revised my review - Must read
Ingenious  safety device that takes a little patience – but worth it
Ring products deliver the security and quality I was looking for
Very easy to install as a replacement for existing WIRED doorbell
Excellent quality of video and motion sensitivity
Nice video doorbell
Silly, but once you've had it there is no going back!
Mostly happy
Great product and Customer Service!!
Impressive Security Device
Feeling Safe with Ring
No Ring!
Fantastic when it works.
The concept is great!  The implementation is equally weak! ****UPDATE1****
I couldn't be more happy with it honestly
Video doorbell how is this happened sooner...its a no brainer!
Ring Doorbell Pro, works GREAT with ALEXA
Too bad I can't leave less than one star
Horrible sound, requires a monthly subscription.
Easy to install. Works well.
... has all the features I want and it was easy to set up
This installs easy, small foot print of regular bell, fisheye camera gives great view and detail = worth the price.
It doesn’t work anymore
Great product, but needs better documentation!
Unit was DOA
Great for basic security, few quirks
The Ring is great...my Wi-Fi not so much
Worth It!
Best purchase in a while
Does not power up.
Great step-by-step instructions and customer service assistance.
Check your voltage
Quick and Easy to install
Customer Service is a joke !
Great but they're not kidding REQUIRES 16v transformer
Great idea, but it's still not mature
BUYER BEWARE
Clear picture, good sound
Easy to install &amp; love faceplate color options
Awesome Product
Easy installation, solid device, great costomer service!
The doorbell is great. I live in a house with older wiring ...
Video skips *a lot*
Works well, but may have some bugs
Installed using a good transformer and simple chime
Overall a good camera
A few pretty big downsides
which allows for a finer tuning of the motion zones
Great doorbell
Great!!
SOLID!!!
Buyer beware!  Requires very high speed DSL!
Doorbell Works and is a great tool
Ok product.. only when works..
Peace of Mind and Easy to Install
Terrible product experience
Wiring is super simple, even an idiot like me can wire ...
That is the good news. After that constant trouble with connection and ...
Who wouldn't want one of these
Came Into Great Use Right Away!
Very poor performing piece of technology.
Grreat Product
This is my idea of a great product. It's relatively inexpensive and it works beautifully
Didn’t work for me
Static and squelching
Stay safe and Monitor your home activity.
Like it, but lots of technical issues that take a lot of time and money to troubleshoot.
Who knew a doorbell could also provide peace of mind :)
Ring Pro - exceed our expectations - and I was skeptical
Works as Advertized!
KNOW WHAT MODEL OF THE RING YOU NEED
Five Stars
We love our Ring Pro doorbell
It really works!
Outstanding Customer Service
Although I am pretty sure I could have install it myself
Great doorbell for capturing people at door
Love the idea, but...
The ring doorbell Pro is such a great device. I was very hesitant on getting one ...
False positives and delay
Piece of mind
I love my Ring!
novilty item
Great Product, Customer service could use a little work.
Worked Great for 6 hours - Updated working now - check power
Flaky operation...router needs to be next to this thing in order to make it work reliably!
One of the worst products I've ever purchased...
I was unable to get the motion detector to work ...
Buyer beware - horrible company
Rings in the house, but online access (the whole purpose of this!) doesn't work in real time
Never miss someone at the door again :-)
Better than expected
Replaced with Nest
Once the product worked it's been pretty great. The installation seemed easy after following the ...
Game changer. Easy peace of mind
Works flawlessly. I'd buy this again
... after a lot of research because of all the great reviews. The experience didn't live up to the ...
Easy to Install!
Very Useful Device with room for improvement
Not a great product for the price. Would not recommend.
Unreliable
Happy with this doorbell overall, but improvements needed
Audio Quality &amp; Sensitivity
Know what's happening on your property
Love the idea of this product but the reality of ...
Great doorbell, would recommend highly
Buggy Product
Love My New RING Doorbell
Got a 3rd unit which seems to be fine, but now my bell does not ring
Great product!
I really enjoy having high quality video from my front door and ...
Almost great
Great potential poor execution
Keep a private eye on your doorstep!
Ring Doorbell Pro Review
Works As Advertised
Will not work/update
Great Doorbell plus Entrance Security System
All good
defective item ordered 3 times
POOR TECH SUPPORT
Best product packaging I have seen and install was much easier than expected!  :-)
Setting motion alert zones is a game changer!
Great device and installation/activation
Two strikes and I'm done.
a few things

Good when it works but still slow and buggy
Works great, good picture quality, but why is there a delay between button press and ring?
Worked for 2 days then stopped and support is HORRIBLE!
I waited several months for the Windows 10 apps to improve, still dissappointed.
Best User Experience in home automation.
I hope my experience is not normal.
Best doorbell by far. Worth the price with crystal clear video!

Video so pixelated; people look like Lego figures
Sometimes it just doesn't work

Ring This!
Garbage, plays back video fine but real-time is inconsistent and unrealiable.
Installation was easy, took around 45 minutes (and it's been downhill since)
Great product. Very useful. Easy Installation and simple and intuitive operation
Great concept, just doesn't work as advertised, and too expensive to deal with the problems it has
Awesome product, great company. Plenty more innovative products coming from Ring.
Security at a reasonable price.
Good security addition; difficult to install on brick; wish performance was faster
Straight on motion detection insensitive!
Security with Ring!!!
Decent if you have the bandwith and a paid subscription.
Great customer service!
Works as Advertised, Easy to Install
